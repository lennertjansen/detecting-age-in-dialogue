1	is that music a problem
1	no i don t think so
1	alright then
1	hi anon nametype m type name thank you for talking to me today erm so can you tell me about the art course you re running here
1	yes this is a a recreational course at the creative innovation centre so the creative the word creative innovation is key to the sort of course we do here it s not the normal erm sort of for instance watercolour for beginners type course so a lot of the erm the people who attend are the majority of them are mature people and quite a few have experienced a reasonably good or very er professional art education but it s open to erm anyone really and we have about twenty doing painting and drawing in the morning and about twenty doing the life drawing and the nearest you could say was related to would be a foundation type course
1	right
1	in an art school so it s quite diagnostic in a sense
1	right okay
1	but it s very erm liberally individually biased er in the sense that people are encouraged to sort of work in a way that suits them and i suppose my philosophy would be that they ll learn more from each other than they would from me
1	right
1	cos cos they work they re encouraged to experiment really
1	right okay so what sort of qualification do they get afterwards is it in line with an art access course or anything
1	no there is no qualification as such
1	no okay
1	so it s not it s not a ratified recognisable
1	right
1	erm educational qualification it it is purely recreational
1	right
1	but it s also seen as part of the sort of a wider remit here where we do all sorts of music and poetry and languages and performance
1	right
1	and even theatre occasionally
1	yeah
1	and we ve got a new cinema
1	oh gosh yes
1	yes
1	i ve just noticed that wow
1	well sorry not a new cinema
1	right
1	we ve got a new
1	screen
1	huge screen
1	a huge screen
1	yes
1	oh wow
1	yeah
1	so what sort of things are they showing then
1	er some very popular films like erm oh citizen kane
1	right
1	we ve been showing and lawrence of arabia we ve done the bicycle thieves
1	yeah
1	italian films
1	right
1	er all sorts really
1	right
1	so trunc i trunc it depends and we haven t got a it s not like a sort of london classic cinema where it s all sort of italian swedish french it s
1	right
1	quite a healthy mix but the the the the art on the friday is seen as just an integral part of the whole centre really
1	right great erm and trunc ha trunc have you seen that wonderful new film er lady in the van with
1	alan bennett s
1	yeah
1	no
1	oh god

1	in the van yeah
1	because yeah i ve been following that for years
1	yes have you
1	yeah but i m looking forward to it and i will be seeing it
1	yeah it s terribly poignant
1	yeah i can imagine
1	and i i i erm i found it incredibly sad
1	yeah
1	although i could see that there was a bit of humour in it but it was incredibly poignant and it left me feel you know with a a feeling of erm she d been on the run all her life basically and that s what that s what the feeling it left me with erm so erm they do a lot of films down at the odeon trunc a trunc and do they do any ballet dancing films or any of that sort of thing here any dance

1	i haven t but it s absolutely i ve heard things like it s so sanitised and clinical it almost
1	oh is it
1	looks like a they re gonna trunc per trunc perform operations in it
1	vocal desc laugh

1	no the unclear
1	she didn t like the staff and she didn t like the students
1	no no

1	to deprive all these people
1	yes
1	in this trunc envi trunc area that there s no fine art education
1	well you remember when i took her to task about it all

1	anon type place yeah
1	anon type place he s not he s not doing it any more now

1	can we
1	we re recording
1	i m recording sorry it won t take much longer
1	another five minutes erm we re nearly finished erm so
1	it was a tory stronghold for years and years and years
1	yeah
1	anon type place cos i i remember anon nametype n type name was
1	yeah
1	the sort of trunc s trunc sitting mp and it was almost like it was his personal fiefdom
1	well absolutely yeah
1	i think he was chairman of the nineteen twenty two committee
1	yeah have you ever heard him speak
1	yes
1	he s brilliant
1	when i was younger
1	absolutely brilliant
1	that would be when i was younger i think he s probably
1	he came to
1	dead
1	well he talked about they were closing the maternity home in anon type place
1	ah
1	and we i went with some friends of mine who had lots of children and had used the maternity home and i went with them to hear him speak and he was absolutely brilliant
1	yeah
1	he really was so erm yeah
1	well he he was quite yeah i think he was quite a sort of one nation tory
1	he was
1	mm yeah a decent chap
1	he really knew how to to give a good speech but then at his age then even then he would have had a lot of experience and to be
1	oh yes
1	a good speaker you need to have a lot of experience
1	yeah yes
1	erm you know anon nametype m type name is a very good speaker so he always gets invited to speak to people
1	yeah i can imagine
1	yeah he s a very good speaker
1	yeah
1	erm
1	and confident with it
1	well yeah absolutely yeah i mean he well when you ve been doing the same sort like yourself when you ve been doing the same subject for years and years
1	mm mm
1	you know erm and you re sort of top of your tree in your whatever it is he s erm we ve got about another five minutes to go so i don t know whether you want to say anything
1	only about trunc sp trunc speaking if we re just talking there
1	yeah
1	i could speak quite relaxed and and no problem at a hundred students
1	yeah
1	a hundred and fifty and i ve done that often
1	yeah
1	i always hated formal speaking though
1	did you
1	sort of like the ba presentation type speech
1	yes yes i know yeah
1	and i really really hated it
1	yeah
1	to the point that i could almost be physically sick beforehand
1	really
1	i never liked that er because it was too formal for me but just generally
1	yeah yeah
1	i have no problem at all
1	no no no i ve never had any problem talking in public either i ve what was my first training was on the stage so i i did three years at drama school
1	mm
1	and i mean performing is better to me than actually
1	yeah yeah
1	doing anything else erm you know much better than anything else really so erm so what do you see the future of this course are you going to be doing anything more or are you gonna keep this going in the same way
1	well the way it s going here
1	yeah
1	this although it s an extraordinarily good building it s not big enough
1	yeah
1	and i i suppose as the the brew house dropped away a bit
1	yeah
1	and i know it s still going
1	yeah
1	but this is sort of almost they ve crossed over
1	yeah
1	and this is on the up i mean i know they ve applied and have got a a an access course
1	yeah yeah
1	running and er for next year so there is other possibilities where they could do sort of er fdas and all sorts here
1	yes
1	but but that would erm need some more accommodation which they ve
1	right
1	possibly acquired this huge place opposite
1	oh right
1	yeah but that wouldn t be anything to do with me i ve really i don t know i m very much an integral part i just really got the thing off the ground
1	no yeah
1	in terms of the visual arts that side of it
1	yeah i think we might stop cos the music s got so loud hasn t it erm so trunc we trunc we ve done fifteen minutes so that s fine alright

0	please help yourself to spinach if you d like some
0	thanks vocal desc laugh well pause dur short nothing trunc excite trunc exciting happened apart from the fact that my my mum got a phone trunc ca trunc no my mum they went on holiday last week and they rang the trunc hot trunc the anon nametype m type name just to check on my grandad and see how he was found out he d gone to hospital
0	for god sake why don t they tell people this
0	what a dick
0	i know
0	yup and then no one had told my mum anon nametype f type name hadn t told my mum
0	are they going to
0	yeah
0	my mum s like given them all like her her details my dad s details
0	yeah because that s horrendous
0	for the hospital to not even know that you ve had two children
0	i know and then they tried to get hold of anon nametype f type name and they couldn t and then they messaged me and were like could you message anon nametype f type name so she can get hold of her mum so she can fucking talk to us they re lucky he only had well not lucky but he only had gastroenteritis so it wasn t like he was dying or anything
0	yeah
0	thanks for the heads up dick
0	and then they re arguing because grandad wanted to leave us money when he dies and anon nametype f type name doesn t want him to because she wants any money that not that there s going to be any money left over to be honest but you know
0	it s because he wanted to leave us five thousand pounds each which for me and anon nametype f type name obviously isn t as much as her because she s got three children
0	and also she s got all these great grandchildren so she feels like she has to like distribute the money further
0	yeah
0	sounds horrible but he doesn t care enough but she s like you know it s just not fair i think all the money should go to us and my mum s like but he doesn t want that and she basically just being really dicky about it
0	it s just so sad
0	yeah i can t imagine ever arguing with anon nametype f type name over money
0	yeah exactly er
0	yeah
0	it is not good
0	yeah it s like her will the will should have been i think should have been final and it wasn t which i thought was really bad
0	what so it got over run
0	yeah the will got overturned and the daughter got something like two hundred and fifty thousand pounds or something like that event desc sound of tap running well it might even been more either way though it was a lot of money and you re just like that isn t what the mum wanted she wanted her money to go to charity
0	there s only three of us pause dur short in fact two of us really
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	than i did but he was still my year but you know pause dur short association a bit
0	no and like i appreciate that everybody has their own thing going on but like to say that not a single one of them has given me a single weekend do you know what i mean or even like popped up for the day like
0	pathetic pause dur short so
0	it s really cheap as well on the train
0	cos that s the other thing you know like pause dur short if they came here pause dur short they d have the expense of the train but i d feed them and i d put them up pause dur short whereas trunc w trunc the other way round i have the expense of paying the train travel
0	yeah and then i have to pay for dinner and everything as well so when i went in april last year i spent seventy pounds in one day just to go and see them and i m like that s so expensive like pause dur short the least you could do is say oh anon nametype f type name if you re coming here i ll host like afternoon tea or i ll make some lunch do you know what i mean like there s just nothing like none of them do it
0	it s the anon type place way isn t it
0	yeah
0	and for all the way to er new york for him and one of them s a lecturer so he had to like wing work off pause dur short ridiculous innit and so i was trunc thi trunc oh i know what it was pause dur short it was anon nametype f type name telling me about her and anon nametype f type name s bridesmaid dresses
0	cos she trunc sai trunc vocal desc laugh they told me that they anon nametype f type name made made her pay for the dresses vocal desc laugh
0	er i don t really trunc understa trunc like i thought that was a bit of the thing of the past like expecting the bride to pay like if i could afford to buy the bridesmaid dresses i would but i d like to feel i d like to think that whoever it was my bridesmaid would understand if i needed them to pay for it do you know what i mean like i feel like that s a that s a conversation that you should be prepared to have as bridesmaid but they re being a bit awkward about the whole thing anyway it s just
0	expensive
0	it s quite expensive so people are paying like a hundred quid a hundred and something quid for three nights in this place right and obviously people are also having to book time off work and they re having to book the friday and the monday off work erm pause dur short but what they haven t contemplated is if you are asking people to go to just like a house for the weekend you ve got to put some serious planning into like keeping those people entertained for the entire weekend and people were kind of trunc s trunc sort of saying like oh you know like i m on a budget i can t do loads i can t spend loads of money so anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name have been trying to come up with different ideas to like do things on the cheap pause dur short erm but one of their activities that they were suggesting for us to do during the day was to go quad biking which most of us like were like oh that sounds quite cool but it was fifty pound per person which is quite a lot of money erm so a lot of people were like no i m not gonna do it so before you know it they were like oh we re gonna have to we ll have to get rid of the quad biking so then people are like oh so what are we gonna do instead and people start suggesting things and anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name are getting really tetchy then cos people are kind of like pause dur short taking over or sort of saying you know like one person will say something and if a few people like it you ve suddenly got a whole group of people that are going oh yeah we should definitely do this
0	yeah
0	shit there s nothing there
0	yeah
0	everyone can have what they want of that pause dur short lunch i would just get loads of bread and
0	just sandwich filling
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh oh no
0	yeah and you just think like it s anon nametype f type name s hen do i can t see anon nametype f type name finding a stripper funny and also pause dur short strippers are awkward at the best of times but more awkward when you have to like get them to come to your house like it s not as if you re like out in a club and it s a bit funny like pause dur short they come into a cottage of fifteen girls like that s not enough of crowd for it to be the
0	not the most outgoing group of girls
0	vocal desc laugh
0	so we re going to we re doing a similar sort of thing for anon nametype f type name s birthday with all friends we re going to
0	what a butler in the buff

0	but you is it is it a weekend
0	we trunc s trunc i it was quality but pause dur short you know when you just
0	whereas like we went home like we got a trunc gi trunc we had like we were on the train back

0	cos the thing is with the like it sounds really depressing but when you take like a whole week off to go abroad like you are knackered when you get back because like you ve taken five days off work but you ve been away for seven
0	and you ve probably just got back
0	yeah

0	i know
0	yeah they re all pretty good pause dur short nothing huge to report anon nametype f type name s saving money for a house anon nametype f type name seem anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name both seem very busy pause dur short nobody can be bothered with anon nametype f type name it s really bad like she doesn t like well you know what it s like she just talks
0	they were they there
0	i don t know how anon nametype m type name does it
0	her next one
0	oh yeah like me and vocal desc misc
0	no way
0	yeah like

0	family holiday with her family
0	but like she s never done that anon nametype f type name
0	no
0	necessarily he s still very much anon nametype f type name s boyfriend
0	whereas like i think she like she s genuinely built up relationships with his family and his friends and stuff
0	so trunc t trunc anon nametype f type name is genuinely her friend
0	and don t ever do anything well you ll probably have to but you ll trunc se trunc you ve got to do it once cos vocal desc laugh
0	oh with anon nametype n type name
0	like cos yes if trunc s trunc yeah go on pause dur long
0	as a friend you know cos that s what you
0	i dunno that s just er the way the way it ll work and i m sure you ll be the same like even if you were thinking oh fucking hell like vocal desc laugh
0	quite rude
0	and erm pause dur short and and anon nametype f type name was like like i i i genuinely can t be bothered with it
0	i m a little bit worried for her just in that though like pause dur short i i appreciate that she thinks she s being like the bigger person sort of saying like oh okay i i just can t be bothered with it like
0	cool
0	i trunc don trunc yeah i think i m i m a little bit tainted cos i i love the girls like i know i know they re i know they can be really bitchy and i guess i m it s easy for me because i ve never really been a target of it i ve
0	and that just says it all
0	like and like i know that sounds stupid because trunc t trunc talk behind people s backs but i honestly like i just don t know what they d say about me like
0	well that s good yeah
0	yeah and also like i think she s almost it sounds really stupid but like by sort of saying like oh i can t be bothered with it but then turning up every so often she makes it almost worse for herself because like
0	yeah but like pause dur short cos she s not been able to go to a few things she s probably thinking oh no i
0	it looks bad
0	cos she she would cos she would just go yeah yeah i can t go and everyone will go oh shock

0	vocal desc laugh it would be shit
0	new car s like yours
0	it s really really nice it was obviously bought to help with the commute and then i commuted with it for about two weeks before i handed my notice in but
0	but you needed a new one
0	i don t know how i mean
0	and for yours you paid
0	erm pause dur short it was five pause dur short it was five five so i paid like four pause dur short four six or
0	is it brand new
0	okay
0	yours is the newest
0	yeah
0	than anon nametype f type name s does
0	yeah good though
0	so you paid five five and then obviously take the
0	already generous
0	yeah that s a deal
0	i already knew that the car was cheap and now you wanna give me a thousand pound for my car yes okay
0	yeah so like anon nametype m type name knew i d want to look at the car and he came back and i he could see that i d bought a car and he was like oh god she okay
0	vocal desc laugh
0	how much was it and i was like well what would you like to know he was like how much how much did you pay if you paid five and your car i ll be happy right i paid four six and my car and he was like no you didn t i m like yes i fucking did yes i did he couldn t believe it so i i felt really proud
0	where did you go to
0	why didn t anon nametype m type name go with you or was he busy
0	good work anon nametype f type name
0	big jobby erm and er like i said i d already done loads of research so i knew that their their prices for like pretty much every model they were like the cheapest by like quite a long way like they were all really really cheap cars erm pause dur short so i went and i like i said just i i actually test drove two cos i like pause dur short i had my heart set on getting a fiesta i really wanted a fiesta like a new shaped fiesta
0	if you are ever looking for cars i couldn t recommend like more like aside from the fact that they they er all the cars are of a very good like price they re really good value like their people there were just so lovely like really really nice like one guy
0	not at all like the guy i obviously test drove both cars like the whole time we were chatting and we weren t he wasn t he wasn t selling the car to me at all he was literally just like chatting to me and just sort of saying like like you know how do you feel like what do you like what do you not like blah blah blah erm and then as we walked in he was like do you have a preference and i m like well i actually think the the clio s nicer inside like cos the other one was a five door as well i was like the three door actually feels like roomier in front and i m not likely to have people in the back very often so like i almost feel like it s better to have more room for me and like my one passenger than i am likely to have
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	i m getting like seven hundred miles with it to the tank so
0	vocal desc laugh fuck off
0	it s a diesel
0	yeah so beforehand i was
0	no vocal desc laugh
0	fill up at convenient moments when you re actually gonna like use some unclear
0	and i was getting four hundred miles if i was lucky
0	no way
0	erm more like three thirty
0	yeah
0	yeah true i i i once got three hundred out of mine and i was absolutely overjoyed
0	yeah i was
0	erm well i don t drive any further than twenty minutes pause dur short do i
0	that s amazing i
0	to anon type place to work so i do that pause dur short saturdays like when i m coaching anon type place and back anon type place and back anon type place and back and during the days anon type place and back er or or into town and back and before i m just starting the starting the car
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	like just as and when like you can
0	yeah
0	upgrade like you ll save a lot of money on your fuel
0	well that s pause dur short i don t think it is cos i was doing er it was exactly the same in my trunc fi trunc in my fiesta
0	i ll tell you what happens when i start going just across town
0	vocal desc laugh
0	more than yours i would imagine
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i can t believe this
0	is it
0	oh
0	yeah well i i
0	does it sound like a diesel
0	beats my hundred and forty three
0	direct debit
0	yeah
0	i don t need that in my life
0	as if you want trunc th trunc i don t think mine was that much
0	that s outrageous vocal desc laugh but obviously with direct debit pause dur short you obviously do pay a little bit more
0	yeah pause dur short that would be about right pause dur short that would be a hundred and forty four yeah
0	yeah that s right pause dur short i dunno i i oh yeah i dunno hard decision obviously it can t be more than sixty quid a year obviously wasn t going twelve months was it
0	yeah
0	so what gym does anon nametype f type name use at the moment
0	cos i know like quite a lot of people are raving cos they ve got good classes and stuff on and everything now as well isn t there
0	yeah i can pause dur short oh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah pause dur short i can hear me coming back to me erm pause dur short so obviously that s really good pause dur short so you pay either trunc ei trunc gym or classes and then whatever you want to pay pause dur short so for example if she wanted to go to the gym so she s got a classes membership if she wanted to go to the gym it would cost her like three pound a time to do it pause dur short or if it was the other way round it would just like cost you three pound a class whatever it would be pause dur short so that s really good
0	and she goes to classes like pause dur short vocal desc misc er monday tuesday pause dur short wednesday pause dur short i don t think she does one on thursday and then sunday or trunc m trunc maybe does a saturday morning one as well pause dur short and so she
0	probably gets and it s a fiver to go if you re for a class if you re if you re not a member
0	pause dur short yeah
0	it s cos it s so popular
0	we had that conversation didn t we
0	yeah
0	one day going pause dur short if we were to

0	well it was a good job you popped round tonight cos he s clearly not pause dur short not much company this evening
0	no it s been good to see you it s nice to chat pause dur long
0	vocal desc laugh yeah it s unclear
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	yeah i ve been meaning to try it for ages and the i was gonna do it at the weekend but i didn t have any time so i think that s gonna be my first
0	the whole day s gone yeah
0	really
0	we were near well we stayed in anon type place erm which is kind of like it wasn t far till anon type place at all cos we went like via the east midlands to unclear so like we weren t
0	did you go through anon type place
0	yeah and you take care
1	cos universities used to buy suns because they were expensive
1	mm we had we had some suns
1	i i mean they sold them more than anything they were kind of things people would have
1	mm
1	particularly or that many companies
1	well they were bigger sorts of things because you needed different sorts of stuff
1	yeah
1	cos we er our our ou system ran on one vax computer
1	yeah
1	mm
1	oh anon nametype m type name used to do that
1	and then we had four vax computers a b c and d
1	anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name did vax at anon type place i think
1	it all linked in and then
1	were they big trunc ca trunc big cabinets did they have erm platters on them whatever you call those like big pause dur short or were they tape things er what did they have going you don t know cos anon nametype m type name used to work on vaxs like washing machines
1	yeah yeah
1	yeah
1	there were four cos there was one of them and then they got four of them
1	yes
1	sort of spaced out in like one here about sort of maybe this bit trunc bi trunc
1	mm
1	bit taller than this little table perhaps
1	mm
1	i mean it s a long time i mean we re going back twenty twenty well a long time twenty five years
1	yeah unclear well at unclear anon type place
1	mm
1	cos vocal desc laugh he had he had some naughty lads who worked in there as well and i ve trunc f trunc forgotten the name of these particular vocal desc laugh naughty lads and they they they were quite lively and there was something about they all used to have to be erm be able to switch off
1	mm
1	these machines if there was a problem erm so you didn t trunc dam trunc so the whatever it was head of the thing or whatever didn t damage you had to switch it off really quick and there was a sequence
1	mm
1	to switching this off so you didn t unclear sort of unclear crash everything but you had to switch it off or whatever i can t think why why you know if there was some problem you had to switch it off but you had to do the switches in the right order so you didn t
1	mm
1	sort of crash the unclear whatevers unclear
1	mm mm
1	or anything and erm i can t think what it was now something or other pause dur short they did did something naughty to anon nametype m type name vocal desc laugh
1	unclear what unclear they made him switch it off wrongly
1	no they did something naughty because it was er sort of see how quick cos anon nametype m type name s not the quickest person in the world
1	mm
1	but he can get moving erm when he wanted to and i don t know what somebody did i don t know whether some i i have a feeling it was something like erm putting some smoke near the fan so it gave the impression it was smoking
1	oh right oh yes yes
1	you know what i mean so it s unclear some smoke
1	yeah
1	so he said oh oh oh oh so of course you know so anon nametype m type name had to switch it off
1	mm
1	very quickly
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh and then they were all standing behind him going oh
1	oh
1	naughty cos they were all naughty boys
1	yes
1	they were all naughty he wasn t er particularly in charge but you know they were naughty and they they they weren t being nasty nasty they were just naughty cos they did silly tricks on each other
1	so er were they other engineers
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	more youthful
1	unclear
1	more youthful spirits
1	yes yes but you know er
1	yes
1	and they were naughty cos they er they er weren t causing any damage
1	mm
1	because it was just you know this gave the impression but erm they were a bit lively
1	yes yes
1	yes naughty
1	sounds like people you could get a little bit fed up with
1	yes but they they er got er they got on alright with him vocal desc laugh cos anon nametype m type name went to anon type place to see erm the man who stood on one leg unclear so unclear
1	very often
1	and played the flute well
1	oh i don t know
1	unclear trunc ha trunc had his leg wrapped round the mic erm
1	i hope he doesn t get
1	anderson
1	trunc h trunc i hope he doesn t have trouble with his leg like mine
1	ian ian anderson who that that was his name but
1	mm
1	jethro tull
1	oh right did he stand on one leg
1	jethro tull jethro tull it s jethro tull s the group but ian anderson was the he played flute
1	well i ve heard of trunc jethr trunc
1	he looked like the pied piper
1	oh yes
1	and he used to wear these sort of erm
1	mm
1	sort of unclear stockinette unclear trousers
1	oh
1	and twiddle about like
1	mm
1	the pied piper and he s very respectable now and wears tweeds and has a
1	has dogs
1	has an estate in scotland
1	like somebody else we know
1	unclear and unclear salmon farms like trunc s trunc vocal desc laugh like somebody else we know yes vocal desc laugh unclear well unclear i don t think his flute playing s quite as good anyway erm he was on jethro tull was on and these younger slightly younger lads wanted to go down and erm cos anon nametype m type name had seen
1	mm
1	the original
1	mm
1	whatever so erm they invited him to go unclear would they he want unclear to go with them cos this is when he had his old white van unclear his old white van and his greatcoat and things
1	mm
1	unclear unclear bless him with unclear his original greatcoat you know trunc w trunc
1	mm
1	which he still wore then unclear so he said er he s a bit like their mascot vocal desc laugh
1	oh
1	in his original outfit
1	mm mm
1	unclear yeah so he unclear vocal desc laugh unclear yeah unclear
1	we ve probably got a few more original outfits to look through haven t we
1	yeah anon nametype m type name that was him anon nametype m type name i remember meeting him somewhere else
1	who was that unclear
1	this was unclear one of his his cheeky boys
1	oh probably very very respectable now probably own multimillion companies
1	oh er no he s he s he s er he s still a bit of a lively lad the thing is er he was er he was a anon type place lad he was a anon type place lad who was very good at engineering and stuff
1	mm
1	erm but he wasn t academic but he was very bright
1	mm
1	erm good at sort of erm doing that sort of stuff he was extremely bright and quick but he wasn t sort of academic in that sense
1	mm
1	so he was er you know he he had to keep him occupied cos he was a bit of a live wire
1	mm
1	but he was a nice he wasn t nasty with it
1	but i guess a lot of the engineers now aren t that aren t really academic sort of people because it s moved to a a regular sort of
1	yeah
1	technical job now hasn t it
1	yes
1	largely
1	yes
1	rather than being a academic skilled job on the
1	well it depends
1	thinking about the sort of people that anon nametype m type name used to have
1	mm
1	working as the field engineers with whatever anon type place did
1	yeah
1	what did anon type place do what it was some sort of computing something or other wasn t it trunc compu trunc i can t think what it trunc w trunc the stuff that anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name s engineers did but they went out fixing things
1	yes
1	and everything s got a computer in it these days hasn t it
1	yes
1	whether they actually fix these things or even in the garage they clip the computer on now don t they
1	yes but i mean it depended it s like at anon type place they have their erm unclear throw them unclear about boys they have their unclear thrown unclear about boys and they have their sort of erm ones who can stick wires in holes and screw something up
1	mm
1	and then then they have the sort of anon nametype m type name who actually knows how it all works and then trunc s trunc anon nametype m type name would sometimes lead over everything
1	mm
1	and have to explain it to the managing director
1	mm
1	but you know it depends what level you re working at
1	yeah
1	cos anon nametype m type name could do all the you know actually read the book and know what it meant
1	mm
1	and teach himself things
1	mm
1	like he was teaching himself that erm whatever it was was it tcp ip
1	oh yes yes
1	or something he he was teaching himself that cos he kind of knew it but he was trying to do it all the bits he used to skip over he was trying to fill in the
1	mm
1	the gaps of it yes
1	i it it always tickles me tcp er because of tcp
1	i know
1	it is tcp isn t it
1	tcp ip
1	the stuff that you don t use
1	tcp yes
1	the stuff we used to have a large bottle of as our
1	for putting on bites and things
1	on our for for our treating anything
1	yes
1	antiseptic
1	antiseptic yes
1	i don t think don t know if it s approved to do that these days
1	i think they trunc st trunc
1	but did we have
1	i think they still sell it or they used to sell it until very recently
1	it s probably got really harmful chemicals in it unclear
1	it s probably got bought out by somebody
1	oh gargle unclear it sometimes has its use unclear for gargling
1	it was for gargling and you could put it on cuts but it was
1	oh
1	a bit oh
1	yes oh it was the only thing i ever had on cuts we didn t have savlon or
1	you could put it on spotty things
1	acriflex yes it went on everything
1	yes oh we i i erm we had savlon sometimes
1	mm i don t remember savlon i just remember tcp
1	yes it was in a no it it was it trunc w trunc it was in one of those you had erm one of those metal sort of tubes that have
1	yes
1	like a hexagonal
1	mm
1	you know before they were
1	yeah
1	just you used to get ointments unclear
1	same sort of thing you d get oil paint in
1	yes that kind of tube
1	mm
1	yes well it wasn t lead like an oil paint tin
1	no no
1	but it was metally
1	mm
1	unclear yes
1	so it s getting on for bedtime
1	think so i m going to go and knit
1	erm what do you think we should do tomorrow er can we do anything useful in anon nametype m type name s kitchen can we clear i think you were quite interested in investigating was it on top of the table
1	erm well if i move those boxes erm that box on the on the table is i believe is quite heavy
1	okay what do you think s in it
1	but
1	is it glasses
1	erm possibly i it ll say on it
1	oh right
1	there is a box that is quite heavy there s two boxes on that table i think or did i move one anyway erm pause dur short i can probably well i have picked it up before but it might might need a bit of trunc s trunc you know steering me onto something
1	yeah
1	can put it maybe on a chair
1	mm
1	or something
1	mm
1	cos i don t wanna put it down on the floor cos it s too heavy to pick up er
1	would that small table help
1	i don t know whether it ll be too heavy on this table
1	well we don t want to break it it s a very important table do you have two of them
1	no i only bought trunc o trunc i only had well they only had one that was vocal desc sigh they only had one and i bought it sort of cos i thought about buying two at the time but there was cos cos they re only plain wood
1	mm
1	and er there was one that had got a few more knotholes
1	mm mm
1	and that was the best one so i bought it but they didn t have any more
1	mm
1	you know those ones they have that they call television tables or whatever they trunc the trunc they were ones that trunc w trunc had that you still get them they re quite tall
1	mm
1	and they have a a top like that they trunc ha trunc they had trunc l trunc hundreds of those but they only had
1	mm
1	a few of these and they didn t get any more in
1	mm i thought about getting a couple of tables like this for
1	yes
1	anon type place
1	yes
1	and they had some on freecycle i think they were made of something that sounded quite i think it was bamboo
1	yeah
1	which i think er was it bamboo no rubberwood
1	rubberwood yes
1	which i quite like actually
1	yes but it you have to check how they re fixed cos this one s quite good because
1	mm
1	it s got that little thing you twist
1	mm
1	but my that little brown one that s really an outside one you know the little one there s a trunc l trunc i ve got a little one like that that s slatted
1	oh right
1	brown criss cross legs
1	yes yes
1	that s leaning on unclear that heap of junk
1	yes
1	now that one you open it up and it clips into and it goes into a hook
1	mm
1	well if you pick it up
1	mm
1	unless you put your hand under and hold that it collapses
1	i m very nervous about moving this one actually
1	well this one s alright cos it s got a peg
1	mm
1	it s got a peg in it as long as the peg s in it unclear well unclear it stands up without the peg in it
1	mm
1	but it has a little peg unclear
1	i didn t go for these rubberwood ones because i just really wasn t unclear up to it unclear
1	yeah it depends how high they are but that little one that s why
1	they look quite nice
1	that little one s quite a nice just small size
1	mm
1	that s why i have it in the house
1	mm
1	but er that s why i tie string round the tops
1	mm mm
1	because
1	mm
1	you know you don t want it collapsing
1	you don t want it collapsing absolutely
1	and my little table that s at the side of the settee with the drop leaves
1	mm
1	the small ones it s all very well cos you pull out these things that hold the flaps up
1	mm
1	but if you put something heavy on one side it tips up
1	yes
1	it s alright if you put it on the sides where the solid bit is
1	mm yeah
1	but if you put it on the other side it tips up because it it trunc ch trunc hasn t got another gate leg
1	mm mm
1	which i didn t appreciate at the time
1	unclear it s hard to though unclear i mean one assumes that unclear these unclear are made gonna be made in a sensible way
1	well it s made it s nicely made
1	mm
1	it s got trunc ni trunc it s nicely made
1	i think there were quite a few of those tables with a similar sort of problem
1	but if you buy one with the trunc e trunc you know so you can get little ones with gate legs
1	mm
1	but they re obviously more expensive because what i used to do with that one was put one leaf up you know and have a half circle table
1	mm mm
1	next to me but you can t put things on one side
1	mm pause dur short mm erm considering it s getting a bit late
1	yes i m gonna have to go
1	oh okay
1	and knit somewhere unclear
1	righty ho i think we how would you feel about leaving the archers until tomorrow
1	oh we can do the archers tomorrow unclear
1	is that alright okay
1	i d forgotten it was an archers day to be honest
1	oh yes it s not saturday yet
1	i thought was thinking it cos we ve had music on unclear
1	yes that s true okay
1	unclear
0	yeah pause dur short from the er
0	is this from the erm was it writing on the registration plate pause dur short it seems that the bus in germany but it s got a british registration
0	okay
0	wow
0	see i treat spring as the start of march
0	sorry
0	hmm pause dur short depends who you are pause dur short it certainly makes a difference to some people
0	cos i think it s a really sort of seasons are quite a unclear quite a vague thing
0	yeah pause dur short i think the thing is like there s some days which are really like this is the epitome of winter pause dur short or this is the epitome of autumn pause dur short but a lot of the time in england it s just a sort of ne somewhere in between things
0	well just grey
0	mm
0	hmm
0	many many many many unclear
0	i m just talking to myself
0	mm pause dur short oh
0	yeah that s what i thought so yeah
0	hmm mm
0	yeah
0	okey dokey
0	oh
0	what for me to i m not even sure what you d be challenging pause dur short hmm
0	yeah prove you wrong yeah
0	unclear to check unclear
0	yes you were
0	i was thinking about the erm there was a sign there for the sort of mini business park saying if you saw it it had sort of technical engineers or whatever
0	mm pause dur short there was one that said there s precision engineers but i don t know exactly what that means
0	well indeed yeah pause dur short it s like us just sticking um posters round the faculties looking for recorders
0	or on where
0	oh okay
0	interestingly i haven t there s not been a single car that i ve seen on our side of the road
0	yeah
0	there is of course you you re travelling at a far higher relative speed so pause dur short and in fact er unclear relative speed pause dur short cos we re probably only travelling at unclear difference and maybe at the most ten miles an hour plus or minus to the vehicles in this direction
0	right pause dur short yes
0	so a hundred and forty
0	yeah
0	well now the road s straightened out
0	ah ha pause dur short it could explain why
0	one two pause dur short these people say the roads are getting busier
0	yeah pause dur short not this one pause dur short is it really quiet what day is it friday so i thought they d be more people walking about
0	what are they gonna build there
0	i don t think so
0	will be taking over the world slowly but surely pause dur short i wonder who the biggest house builder is
0	i m sure there s another one as well pause dur short oh we were talking about you know like book and cook pause dur short the fact that in some areas some people pronounce them book and cook
0	right
0	so we haven t actually past any cars
0	unclear
0	hmm
0	mm
0	this road sign
0	yes indeed
0	do you know anyone who smokes a pipe
0	anon type place cricket correspondent
0	oh so what s an over like a round
0	yeah exactly pause dur short mm pause dur short ha i m the wrong person to ask pause dur short ha pause dur short i never even watch cricket
0	ah pause dur short exciting
0	but i don t know if it s actually anything else
0	mm
0	ah okay pause dur short but yeah um the original owner of the lords was called lord
0	the original owner was called thomas lord
0	yes i was thinking it s something like that pause dur short um but yeah that s what the the band are named after after that pause dur short and yeah i say band it was it s the guy you know the divine comedy
0	well that that description doesn t really help
0	i i don t really know them very well very much
0	hmm mm pause dur short ha ha
0	i don t really know what the going rate is pause dur short probably yeah pause dur short it might not be very good pause dur short i mean i think the the idea is that these are all really nice pause dur short and i think yeah the trunc i trunc yeah sort of in people s heads if they re not gonna trunc u trunc keep something afterwards pause dur short but no you re probably right it probably is trunc che trunc much cheaper just to er to buy one
0	and then literally you could probably resell it at no loss
0	mm mm
1	no these are the ones that i bought did i tell you trunc fr trunc where the place where i stayed
1	you said it was somewhere i couldn t remember where
1	down anon type place erm that she made pottery
1	heavy pause dur short very nice
1	i m not thrilled with the colour but it s a lovely shape to hold pause dur short very satisfying and a decent size of handle that you can put your hands through
1	yes
1	erm so i bought four pause dur short and what do you think of the coffee because that s got almond milk in cos i
1	it s strong for me
1	oh do you want some trunc m trunc more hot water some more milk or
1	no leave it i ll i ll drink it but it er it is too strong really
1	vocal desc laugh that is a silly thing well if it s too strong i can add a bit there s still a bit of space in the mug mind you that would make it heavier
1	oh you
1	i really meant what do you think of flavour pause dur short can you taste that it s not milk milk
1	i don t think so
1	i think that i ve tried both almond milk and soya milk erm the soya milk is slightly higher fat it mean it s still it s comparable to semi skimmed and the almond milk is actually slightly less erm pause dur short so i think it does taste a little bit richer but there s not a lot in it erm
1	i wouldn t have known it was anything different
1	no i mean there s a range of when you go there s a different ones some of them have got flavourings in and god knows what erm and some of them are sweetened well to me that turns them into trunc some trunc trunc tha trunc then not then a milk substitute there s
1	mm i agree
1	they re something different erm so i just went for pause dur short the original you know
1	although there is sugar in milk it s lacrose isn t it pause dur long
1	yes but
1	i remember at school being told there was sugar in er there was sweetness in milk
1	mm
1	and thinking mm sort of thing and they gave us a glass of water and a glass of milk and if you compared the water with the milk yes it was sweet
1	mm
1	you could tell
1	well isn t it isn t that what the problem is that you re that you can be lactose intolerant
1	i suppose
1	erm
1	did i didn t say lactose what did i say
1	you said lacrose and i think that s
1	i was gonna say that was wrong
1	yeah and and i listened to it and thought
1	no
1	no it trunc is trunc it is unclear
1	you should ve said
1	yeah well pause dur short erm but
1	yeah i like this beaker to hold
1	yes pause dur short erm cos you get the pause dur short the chunkiness of of a a bowl if you like a breakfast cup
1	yes
1	without it being so wide and difficult to to hold
1	mm
1	yeah
1	well erm when anon nametype f type name left her mum and she came down to my house and brought me a beaker and it was these colours and it was that lovely curved shape it didn t have a sort of stand on the bottom
1	mm
1	and eventually it got broken and i tried all over to get one like it cos i d really liked it
1	yes
1	the hold of it and everything but i never found one
1	well if you see together the four that i bought you would you d know that they were hand thrown these two are pretty similar in shape and everything but the trunc oth trunc the other two are very trunc sl trunc they were all slightly different height and and
1	mm
1	trunc sli trunc you know erm and i hadn t really realised that trunc th trunc that s inevitable with hand thrown pots isn t it
1	i suppose it is
1	erm pause dur short she d got a range and i i got trunc f trunc the four that seemed most similar but it was kind of two pairs rather than a four if you see what i mean
1	mm pause dur long well i didn t think i d be sitting here in this sunshine
1	no
1	this morning
1	well i m trunc rel trunc relieved it s given me that s those are the sheets that were on the bed when anon nametype m type name was here which is over a week ago
1	mm
1	and it s the first opportunity i ve had to erm to wash them i did one lot of washing pause dur short you know just of clothes and hung them out and basically they were as wet when i brought them in
1	mm
1	as they had been when i put them out it was just such a damp grey day
1	mm
1	erm i did it and had to dry them inside and of course at this time of year they don t dry inside very quickly
1	we ve had perhaps a couple of hours of slightly sunnier than all the gloom
1	yeah
1	each afternoon cos when anon nametype m type name came he was sweating pause dur short you know with just doing things
1	well it hasn t necessarily been cold
1	no
1	but
1	but i ve had the fire on each year in
1	if oh yeah but if it s grey and damp that doesn t necessarily help does it
1	no
1	there s one of those spider s trunc w trunc there s a spider s web there i don t know whether you can see it
1	what am i look at the glass
1	just there through the glass a spider s web
1	yes
1	yes er
1	vocal desc laugh
1	there was one
1	there s loads of spiders at the moment
1	yes it must be that time of year there was one in the trunc she trunc the big shed when i walked in the other day right across the middle of the shed and i hadn t seen it and i walked straight into it
1	yeah
1	and it actually ended up i had to come back and clean my glasses cos they ended up with the parallel lines of the of the cobweb right across one lens it was really weird but i was very happy that i didn t end up with the spider going down my neck cos it was a large one vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well as i go into the greenhouse each each day i do that as trunc wa trunc go through the doorway
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and if you go between the greenhouse and anon nametype f type name s hedge you re doing this
1	yes yes well i ve i get very large ones in the house sometimes sort of and they stand out particularly on the dining room carpet of course erm but well i mean they don t bother me particularly but it it is annoying to walk into the the cobwebs they seem to do that round all my doors they do it at the front door as well
1	mm i ve had one or two pretty big ones in the bath which anon nametype m type name tends to rescue with a glass and piece of card
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well i don t want just to wash em down the bath it isn t fair vocal desc laugh
1	well yeah but there are millions of spiders in vocal desc laugh we pause dur long
1	they re supposed to bring good luck aren t they spiders
1	well if you believe in things like that
1	mm
1	mm
1	well i d rather believe in it than not
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh i ve tried to get up that white buddleia
1	right
1	i trimmed it back to about a foot pause dur short and i ve dug and dug and dug and i ve got it clear around the three sides but one root is going right back i think it might even go under the wall and into the hut
1	right
1	so i ll get anon nametype m type name to finish off digging it up
1	okay fair enough that means it s going to be difficult to plant though doesn t it
1	well i think you can root trim
1	mm you could do that before you dug it up then couldn t you
1	well i thought about that as well but i i d wait and see what he does
1	yes erm
1	he s
1	well i ll hold off on what i was thinking seeing as it was white and i ended up you know i was supposed to have blue one pink and one white
1	oh yes
1	and i didn t i ended up with two purple and one white and i don t know whether the purple ones were meant to be blue or pink because well blue or red pause dur short they didn t look quite like either of the of the ones
1	mm
1	in the er catalogue anyway i ended up with the two purples ones together erm pause dur short i want to grow up a bit more a barrier because where that tree was cut down
1	mm
1	there s now a space through to next door now you can t see it when you re sitting here because of that bush but if you re further down you can or even
1	mm
1	when i m up on the decking i can i can if he s pottering around in the trunc gar trunc in the greenhouse i can see him
1	mm
1	i mean it s not exactly hugely intrusive but the idea was to grow the buddleias erm
1	mm
1	in that space erm and i thought i d put the white one between the two purple ones well at the moment they re still in pots and i won t plant them out until i ve got yours
1	well anon nametype m type name spent his couple of hours last week getting the raspberries cleaned up and clear er i d spent a good three quarter of an hour for about three days running getting rid of all the stuff they were not taken care of at all last year i always used to weed them and everything and i just didn t do anything and i don t think i had more than six raspberries anyway
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but you can t blame em but what they ve got and it s happened over the last about three years but this year was worse is bindweed and it s around all the raspberries or it might be that way i don t know vocal desc laugh unclear tell you erm and as he was saying if you leave as much as that in the ground it wills sprout so i might be stuck with bindweed forever more but if i can do something about it in the spring so it doesn t get a a big hold
1	yes
1	as it s done
1	yeah
1	we ll see but he s he s spent a lot of time there pause dur short and i ve got now well he finished getting the last apples off er cos he was faffing around by the tree pause dur short so those are all on the bedroom floor pause dur short and i have had i do go in about every two or three days and pick out anything that looks as though it s going bad and chuck it
1	mm
1	but anon nametype f type name has had two lots i took anon nametype f type name some and fortunately anon nametype m type name had been blackberrying so they had blackberry and apple pie they were very
1	mm
1	pleased to see them anon nametype m type name has had some anon nametype m type name has had some anon nametype f type name s had some so oh and anon nametype f type name when she came so i ll
1	so you ve had a good crop
1	well yes because
1	cos i thought you had a good crop last year
1	i was gonna say last year it was embarrassing
1	yes so i wouldn t have expected you to have had a lot this year mm
1	oh you ve had some of course
1	mm yeah well i will have some more erm pause dur short you could have brought them actually i i ve i ve got a drawer in the kitchen that doesn t normally have anything in
1	mm
1	that i ve lined with newspaper and i can i can put the space to put them in slightly separate from each other pause dur short erm
1	right yeah anon nametype f type name says she wraps each one in newspaper
1	well we i remember doing that at at
1	i used to do it
1	at grandma s house
1	oh
1	and putting them in the back bedroom do you not remember that apples and pears
1	well i must have done it and and everything
1	when i was a kid i can i remember doing that
1	we were certainly did it at our house when we d apples there
1	well i er i used to do that with my apple tree actually when i think about it it depends how many you ve got i suppose
1	yeah
1	as to whether it s worth it pause dur short erm and you can of course do stewed apple and freeze it
1	yes i ve done that i ve got a big bag full of that pause dur short and i made three apple pies in erm those little foil things pause dur short cos one of those is big enough for two
1	mm
1	in fact a bit too big
1	well again you can freeze apple pies can t you
1	mm pause dur short that s where they are
1	unclear but er unclear
1	in fact i did one apple and blackcurrant which just
1	wow
1	makes it a big different
1	there s two butterflies having a right dance just there i don t know trunc whe trunc it s well surely the wrong time of year for them to be mating but they were er pause dur short one of them s there but there were there was a pair sort of flying together you know
1	oh pause dur short well perhaps they re befuddled by the weather
1	vocal desc laugh i m glad there s a bit of a breeze as well as the sun because pause dur short well firstly that ll help my washing dry but also i want to cut my lawn pause dur short it s needed doing for a while and when it s wet it s it s not particularly nice and also i ve had other things that also needed doing in the garden shall i show you my latest project er i can t take you down the garden
1	no
1	to show you but i ve got some photos pause dur short erm pause dur short this is you know i i think i probably said i got anon nametype m type name to er help me sort the where the compost bin was
1	yes
1	erm so i ve been building a compost heap as it were building you know doing it with the bricks pause dur long er and that is pause dur short well i don t know what you can see for that towel but but you know where those bushes grow out sort of
1	mm
1	behind that
1	right
1	the garden does actually seem to curve slightly to the left so you really can t see it from here pause dur long but obviously that s been trunc tak trunc oh taking me time pause dur short and every i ve it s taken me three goes probably five to five and a half hours altogether spread out over three goes cos it does my back in and every trunc sing trunc each of those three times i ve carefully checked the weather forecast and seen it wasn t supposed to rain today or trunc n trunc first thing the next day and every single flipping time it s rained earlier than it had been forecast to do i mean the last time it actually i mixed the cement and it started drizzling
1	mm
1	having been nice and sunny when i started off so i just had to carry on pause dur long i think i ve actually got them in here
1	i think we re gonna end up with a darker cloudier before so long it s
1	mm
1	greyed over but i certainly think your washing will be drying pause dur long
1	okay pause dur short oh it s just it s still come on that s it can you see
1	vocal desc laugh oh exciting
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes i can see
1	so that bit i built there and that s the the compost bin you see that and i
1	yeah
1	and i put all the compost into those bags and then pause dur short it s pause dur long that s that s compost and that s composting as it where
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh oh erm so and i m pleased with that
1	yes
1	i mean okay it s very rough brickwork
1	well that doesn t matter does it
1	but as long as it stands up
1	and it does the job
1	and it doesn t even need to be able to stand up you know pause dur short amazingly pause dur long mm oh what s that over there pause dur short cos it hasn t got a lot of pressure on it or anything pause dur short that was the biggest i could manage and i just thought if it s open at the front i ll be able to
1	yes
1	put a spade in which is a lot more convenient than the the compost bin pause dur short erm
1	yeah you don t stop do you
1	well i mean the other thing i as i say i got anon nametype m type name to do a few jobs erm
1	what sort of age is he
1	sixty nine
1	oh
1	erm i seem to have missed a year somewhere cos i he his birthday was in august pause dur short and i thought that was his sixty eighth but no so erm pause dur short but i mean he s doing this training for a half marathon pause dur short so he he contacted me before he came would it be okay if he used my treadmill pause dur short and he was out on the patio doing his exercises at half past six vocal desc laugh erm and then pause dur short i didn t he didn t do that much on the treadmill to be honest i think he only did about three trunc k trunc kilometres which isn t very much
1	we had a letter i should think about three weeks ago cos i d forgotten about it erm to say our electricity s going off in the morning
1	oh
1	they re doing some cable work pause dur short er where there are cables i don t know i don t know what it s all about it will be off for a short time it said it was very badly written i ended up doing teacher s corrections to it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i can t bear it i have to
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	and erm pause dur short oh er you know if you ve got computers have em all switched off and this that and the other and it was for the twenty second of september which is tomorrow
1	mm
1	but as i say this came at least three weeks ago and i d completely forgotten about it whether it will matter or not i don t know because i haven t anything fancy switched on it mentioned burglar alarms and anon nametype m type name seems to think if it s all off when they switch it on again our alarm might go off in other words be at home
1	oh right
1	but
1	i wouldn t have thought i mean i certainly
1	they ought to have reminded us
1	yes if they tell you that early i if i have occasionally i don t know about at this house actually but at the other house more than once there must have been some sort of power cut
1	yeah
1	because you notice that some things are flashing or whatever
1	yeah
1	you know erm and burglar alarm was never seemed to be affected at all i would just have thought that a modern burglar alarm was designed so that it it could ride out things like that because it does happen
1	mind you ours isn t all that modern you see it ll be
1	no but mine at the other house wasn t
1	no
1	i mean it might have been newer than yours but i when you when you have the new
1	double glazing
1	no no thing put on on that those are not the buttons that you originally had are they
1	probably not
1	so keypad that s the word i m looking when you had that was it a whole new burglar alarm or did you just have a new keypad put there
1	i think it was just a new keypad cos anon nametype m type name did it with your dad
1	mm
1	in the first place
1	right
1	and we never had any deeper work done in other words
1	mm
1	climbing in the loft or anything so it must just have been a new keypad and i don t know who did it and i don t know why pause dur short so we shall see i mean as er as we were saying all we need to do is is punch if it goes off punch the number in
1	mm
1	but erm i mentioned it to anon nametype f type name and she didn t know anything about it so i said well it must just be our side of the road and we were wondering if it s something to do with anon nametype f type name s
1	well it could be couldn t it
1	yes
1	if they re doing all that er
1	yeah
1	building work
1	i haven t seen anon nametype m type name to ask whether they re erm
1	mm
1	involved or not pause dur short but the other day they had what i d call a rubber hose probably that much diameter running from the back of anon nametype f type name s right up the drive across the little road and onto the island and the end of it just propped into one of those trees where kids climb
1	mm
1	and where it crossed the road there was a concrete slab weighting it down so that nobody tripped or whatever
1	mm
1	and we can t imagine what that was
1	mm
1	there was nothing draining from it there was no water coming out
1	oh that s weird
1	well i mean it couldn t be gas and it couldn t be electricity so goodness knows what they re doing
1	oh that was i m not sure what something come some sort of did you see
1	no
1	go to my trunc fee trunc bird feeder and then it flew off into that tree
1	no
1	cos i haven t seen anything at the bird feeder for at least a week and i found that happened last year at this sort of time i d had quite a lot of activity over the summer and then not in the autumn and i don t know where they go and what they re doing and whether it s because you you actually get different birds in summer and winter and this is the changeover period which it is
1	mm mm
1	erm but i don t know about pause dur short you see i would i would have assumed that with tits and things that it was the trunc sa trunc it was the same birds but i m not sure that it is necessarily because i ve been told that robins yes he was there that robins for example if you ve got a robin in your garden in winter and in summer it s not necessarily the same robin pause dur short they that even they migrate
1	they re coming
1	yes these are the grey tits hello darlings pause dur long all looking very handsome that is a pause dur short i mean i know there were adults coming before but also there were a lot of youngsters and i think that could be the youngsters that now have are in full adult plumage
1	mm
1	because that all three that landed then looked to be adults to me and i don t think there were three trunc ad trunc
1	pause dur short well they re quite sizeable
1	it s not the size it s the it i mean they the they were they were the same sort of size it s just the markings
1	when i was down with the raspberries obviously i i took that little erm seat that i sit on to weed and so on and i was quite happy down there by myself bit of birdsong around and suddenly there was a a movement and it was a robin and it came and it came round the other side of me and it came down there and it looked at me and i trunc don trunc i think he must have thought i was gonna dig a wormhole for him
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm but it didn t go away particularly mind you i didn t make any big movements and it s done it about three or four different days
1	oh good
1	so
1	you see the robin that comes here pause dur short is i thought robins were like that were quite confiding is the word that birdwatchers seem to use
1	oh
1	but the robin that comes here isn t like that it s very shy pause dur short the tits are much less nervy than the robin vocal desc laugh
1	mm pause dur short well i haven t seen him i mean occasionally i ve seen a robin in the garden but this was sort of persistent
1	mm yeah pause dur short but the jay hasn t been for quite a while so
1	no i haven t seen the jay for a while and we we
1	i saw it in the tree the other day but it hasn t been to the feeder that i think it s probably moved on you know
1	mm
1	the things like that do seem to go in in phases pause dur short erm
1	and i ve not heard a woodpecker this year i don t think
1	no
1	and we always have done
1	and i pause dur short well i wasn t hearing it last year so much as it came to the feeder quite a lot and this year that s why i ve had those peanuts out even though the squirrel comes but no not a sign pause dur short which is a shame
1	i m feeling something yes
1	and you re finished and you turn it
1	oh it s there
1	and look on the if you don t turn it and look on the bottom unless you ve finished
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh it says anon nametype f type name
1	you might vocal desc laugh
1	it says anon nametype f type name on the bottom and that was her name
1	oh
1	which i thought was odd because pause dur short she wasn t that old i mean pause dur short she wasn t young but to me anon nametype f type name is
1	anon nametype f type name s are our anon nametype f type name s lot
1	yes is at least your generation if not older whereas she clearly wasn t
1	older i hadn t any anon nametype f type name s at school
1	right yeah pause dur long no going back to jobs that anon nametype m type name sort of set up erm you know the compost bin was one thing erm but the other another thing that i ve been working on i ve i ve painted the
1	right
1	front room windowsill it s
1	oh
1	it s doesn t pause dur short it looks a lot better because it s white but it ended up with a lot of pause dur short quite deep grooves in it and i sanded it and what it really needed was planing well i haven t really got a plane so i didn t
1	mm
1	so it still looks quite sort of scratched but most of it you don t really see it because of the blind and the fact that it s now white instead of a nasty tacky brown varnish stuff not
1	mm
1	not brown varnish veneer erm
1	oh mm
1	does look definitely better so i m i m leaving it like that for now
1	so have you much more to do with your house
1	well there s the upstairs room to do which i i m planning to do probably at christmas pause dur short erm and yes i meant to talk to you about anon nametype m type name the bottom terrace of the orchard pause dur short needs to be soil so that i can plant vegetables and things and i was an idiot to plant that grass there at all so
1	oh
1	in other words the work that anon nametype m type name did has kind of been wasted because i planted grass and now i want to dig it all up again
1	mm
1	i don t think that i m going to be able to do that myself and the one of the reasons being that i can t get the big powerful strimmer to start when anon nametype m type name was here after a lot of effort he managed to get it going and i did some strimming but you do one lot and then you need to do another you know i need i need to get it right down to as close to the ground as possible and i didn t do that and i tried to start it again and i just i can t do it pause dur short it for a start it really needs two people it jumps about like fury when you trunc tr trunc when you pull the you know it s one of these
1	mm
1	it s a it s a petrol driven thing and you need to pull a string to spark it erm and even if you ve got one foot on it it s a lot easier if someone s also holding it
1	mm
1	but also you need to do it a few times with pause dur short the throttle open and that s this it you basically need three arms
1	vocal desc laugh oh right
1	and a very long body vocal desc laugh you know or very long arms or something it s just a stupid design erm the other one i can start because it s not so stupidly designed but that one pause dur short erm and i actually i couldn t pull the string out of the it s full length it was sticking for me
1	mm
1	which meant obviously it wasn t gonna spark erm pause dur short so i was trunc won trunc i mean it s i don t know how many hours work it would be to clear it it s hard to tell pause dur short erm but i was wondering about asking anon nametype m type name to do it because i really think that it s beyond me pause dur short even if i could get the trunc strim trunc what i wanted to do was try and get the strimmer working strim it down to stubble and start digging it up with the fork and see pause dur short er how much it was doing my back in and how much i could do at a time and whether i thought i could manage it but if i can t do the strimming then i can t do the the
1	mm
1	the four kilo unclear though
1	mm
1	because
1	so er how much would you want him
1	well i need him to come and look at it and tell me pause dur short what he thought really
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short it s hard for me to judge because it would take me weeks and weeks because i would i knowing how long it took me to do that front garden digging it all up
1	mm
1	i could only do half an hour at a time and then my back was seizing up
1	mm
1	erm and i can t get a lot done in half an hour he could probably do more than me in half an hour anyway
1	mm
1	but i don t know pause dur short so
1	well he s going away at the end of this month pause dur short i think only to scotland or wales or something like that
1	well i mean it s not urgent but it needs doing this autumn
1	well
1	so that i can
1	i ll certainly ask him but i don t know how much time
1	no
1	he s prepared to spend on things cos i don t know who else he goes to anon nametype f type name of course
1	well it s not going to be an ongoing it s a sort of one off job getting it cleared that i ve planted it with this meadow grass and i shouldn t have done i should have left it clear pause dur short so it needs getting back to soil again
1	mm
1	and then i would have to keep it weed free
1	yeah
1	well there s no point in doing it too soon because the grass is still growing a bit
1	mm
1	but so it trunc i trunc it s an autumn job erm pause dur short i ve got another gooseberry bush on order
1	right
1	to replace that one that died so it needs doing before that would come pause dur short erm pause dur short but anything that s
1	i m pleased with that rhododendron you found
1	oh good
1	it er it looks a really good bush so we used to have i m keeping the receipt because they will replace things well like
1	mm well i mean it wasn t exactly cheap was it but it
1	no
1	i found that trunc tha trunc two or three times i ve at garden centres i ve looked and thought oh yes that looks like a good bush and then backed off when i realised how much
1	yes
1	things like that are
1	well i wasn t expecting to pay that i think i d thought probably thirteen or fourteen pounds but i ve thought about a rhododendron down there for a long time
1	mm
1	so i thought right i ll have one
1	vocal desc laugh
1	lovely sunshine s going
1	well the amount of trouble once they re in you just leave them
1	well yes and it s exactly i mean deliberately where i can see it from the kitchen
1	mm
1	which is is what i wanted because there s a fuchsia there that hasn t really grown much at all and when i think about fuchsias there isn t a right lot of colour for the size of the bush
1	i think that depends on the fuchsia well i went walking in anon type place on thursday and one of the gardens that i went past had well a range of things along er they had a sort of flowerbed by the by the edge of the garden as it were and it had several different small fuchsias which were in full bloom
1	mm
1	and they were they were they were sort of this size pause dur short a mass of bloom and not as much erm
1	mm mm
1	actual foliage now it may be that when they get bigger that happens less i think the one that i had at the other house was pretty good value but this one here
1	yeah that was when you came up the steps weren t it
1	yes but this one here is as you re saying it s a lot of trunc gr trunc of foliage and not very much blossom
1	yeah
1	erm i m just kind of waiting for the blossom to die down a bit more and then i m going to cut it down completely and put something else there because it it also just grows so much in a season that i m constantly having to cut it back to able to use the path which is silly
1	mm oh i ve had the notice about the brown bins
1	oh right so you are getting them
1	so i ve an october collection of green bags
1	mm
1	and then that s it till something like april fourth when it will be bin it trunc y trunc you know you have to ring up to order it
1	mm
1	which i thought was a bit odd and then i thought well there must be a lot of people who ve had green bags who ve never ever used em
1	mm
1	so same with brown bins i suppose
1	well i don t think that anon nametype f type name and i can t remember what the son s called have got a brown bin when i ve been putting mine out there hasn t been one going out there
1	oh
1	and and they certainly put other things out
1	but you rang up to order it
1	oh yeah
1	mm
1	so but i mean obviously they ve got quite a big garden so i don t know why they ve made that choice
1	mm pause dur short i can t say i m thrilled about this brown bin i just cannot see it holding as much as i need it to hold when the two hedges are cut
1	yes well i mean it said
1	er
1	something like it holds the equivalent of three to five
1	yes
1	green bags well for a start there s a big difference between three and five and secondly no way does it hold five green bags worth that s just ridiculous
1	mm
1	erm and anything that s a bit of an awkward shape pause dur short quite often would go into those green bags because they re quite wide
1	yes
1	whereas it won t into the bin so you re having to spend more time cutting things down to fit i m still using the green bags as well
1	well i m keeping them at the moment to see how it all goes
1	yes well i ve exactly i mean i had five or six er and i m keeping those
1	i think i have five now
1	and
1	i think i once had seven
1	i m having to pause dur short go to the tip as well although to be fair i missed the september brown bag brown bin collection because that was when i was away
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short but yeah pause dur short no it it s it vocal desc misc what annoys me when they send out the information with things out is they they try to present it as if it s better for you pause dur short if they were just honest
1	yes
1	and said we re sorry darlings but it s a lot easier for our bin men
1	yes
1	then fair enough because it is vocal desc laugh erm but you know they re pretending that it s in some way more convenient for us which is clearly isn t pause dur short and if you read the rest of the thing
1	it going cold
1	it s a bit cooler now the sun s gone hasn t it
1	mm
1	erm you know if you read the rest of the thing which
1	it s blowing more
1	which is clearly sort of addressing possible complaints and and queries and so on
1	mm
1	it s obvious that a lot of people s immediate reaction is oh no that s not very good for me
1	mm well it just depends how much garden you ve got really
1	yes pause dur short erm well i suppose they must have had some idea of how many pause dur short green bags
1	mm
1	people averaged if you see what i mean
1	mm pause dur short and they re very generously letting us keep our green bags
1	mm
1	mind you i ve had two fairly new ones i i mean a year older more than that with their handles sort of in the middle of the sides rather than on top and they ve been very difficult to carry
1	oh oh no i haven t got any like that but erm i mean a couple of mine are bit sort of torn and battered
1	yeah
1	but they re still worth keeping it depends what you put in them anyway doesn t it
1	mm
1	if the if it s mostly branches that s fine if it s small things they might fall through the hole but er
1	mm well i ve cut my own buddleia back as well because that s er finished i don t think there s anything else that wants cutting back those bushes where the leaves come red when they re new
1	mm
1	erm anon nametype m type name said i ll cut that back a bit but he s a bit one for shaping it all beautifully
1	mm
1	and i like a natural shape
1	yeah well i i m going to have to buy a hedge trimmer because
1	i ve got one you could have it because he uses his own it he he doesn t use mine
1	yours is trunc elec trunc has got a cable though
1	mm
1	i mean pause dur short actually i might take you up on that and and borrow it if you like this season
1	well you can try it yeah
1	i mean i ve got an trunc exten trunc well i ve got your extension cable but i have actually got erm pause dur short not one on a i ve got yours that s on a drum and i ve got another one that that isn t
1	oh you ve got that have you
1	er yes
1	not that i ve been looking for it i d forgotten about it
1	well again i thought that you said that anon nametype m type name brought his own stuff
1	he does
1	and therefore you
1	yeah
1	didn t really need it erm and obviously i need that for mowing the lawn and and things and and erm i like that better than the one that i inherited which is a lighter sort of thing erm so i could see how that went trunc bec trunc i just think that with a garden this size it s more convenient to have a petrol driven thing but as on the other hand as anon nametype m type name said i m finding it so difficult to start petrol driven things that maybe that s not the best the hedge trunc tri trunc
1	yeah
1	i inherited a hedge trimmer and it had been left with petrol in it over winter which you re not supposed to do and that had perished something inside and anon nametype m type name tried to get it fixed and it was some little he replaced the spark plugs and then there was some little sort of tube thing and he bought some and trunc fi trunc and fiddled about and he s spent so long on it erm that i said apart from anything else if i m paying him and hourly rate er it s cheaper to buy a new hedge trimmer
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and he and he was just determined to sort it but he never did of course and it and it s still up there unfinished and so unsorted and i suspect it never will even
1	mm
1	even if i took it in to be repaired i just think it s probably beyond repair erm and you pay so much for a professional to do that sort of thing i might as well buy a new one but i ve got i mean that thing there needs trimming erm that green thing in by the pond
1	mm
1	erm but now in the front garden there s another green thing like that that grows over where you walk up the path
1	mm
1	that i haven t done anything to for quite a while that is getting a bit straggly and needs sorting erm the hebes need a bit of trimming and as i say i want to cut that fuchsia down if i start doing all that with my hand clippers it really makes my hands shake i find
1	mm
1	erm and there s quite possibly things down the garden as well i m not very sure pause dur short so pause dur short i think pause dur short at some point i will come over and borrow that
1	mm
1	and see how it goes but it may just be too awkward to use a trunc p trunc er an electric one in this garden
1	it could be yes
1	i mean i did borrow it for that holly hedge at the other house
1	oh did you
1	mm erm
1	well you may as well give it a try
1	mm so i certainly know i can i mean it s anon nametype f type name was saying she was hoping anon nametype m type name would come back er in time to to erm cut down their hedge you know they ve got this well allotment you would call it if it was in england in german it is called a garden but in germany it s much more than allotment you know it s got a hut in it that s swish enough to it s got running water and and you could sleep there
1	mm
1	for heaven s sake you know vocal desc laugh when say hut i don t just mean a shed
1	and is it by the house
1	no no no i mean it s where there are others but there s
1	right
1	being germany there s all sorts of rules and a certain percent of it percentage of it has to be given up to produce
1	oh
1	which i think is good and all sorts of things but they come round and inspect it from time to time and and she was saying they re going to get into trouble cos their hedge was too high and she couldn t use the hedge trimmer vocal desc laugh so she was hoping anon nametype m type name would get back in time to do it vocal desc laugh
1	is she the same sort of age as him
1	she s a few years younger erm i would say
1	i d imagined her your age i mean
1	no she s
1	i must have seen her
1	erm she s more than ten years older than me but not a lot more so i would say she s probably about sixty three or four now
1	mm well didn t you go for something like a special birthday
1	that trunc wa trunc that was her fiftieth though that s quite a long time ago
1	fiftieth good heavens
1	yeah erm pause dur short and that was the same year that i went to unclear so it must have been two thousand pause dur short when we think about it
1	mm
1	so she must be sixty four
1	mm
1	cos her birthday s at the end of august
1	yep
1	erm yes she had a bit do well she she did have a do for her sixtieth erm but where they were before of course they had a big they had a detached house with quite a big garden and they rented a marquee and put that up
1	mm
1	erm and invited all the
1	and did you go
1	all the neighbourhood and everything no only for the fiftieth yes
1	oh
1	but for the sixtieth obviously they re they re now in a flat so they couldn t do that
1	mm
1	and i think they rented the village hall which is probably if it s attached to the church it ll be kind of next door cos the church is just over the wall stroke hedge from where they live because sometimes when i ve been skyping anon nametype m type name the flipping bell s been ringing and he s had to shut the window cos we couldn t hear it other vocal desc laugh
1	mm pause dur short i think the sun might be coming back it s down there
1	well yes i can trunc s trunc there s a you can see a bit there but there s quite a lot of cloud up there it s er it s not as nice a day as i thought it was going to be pause dur short however
1	mm
1	as i say i unclear
1	do you iron those sheets
1	no
1	well i don t i just wondered if er if you had to depends quite what they re made of
1	they re just cotton but i need to buy a fitted cotton sheet i don t know why i haven t got one because i used to have flannelette sheets on in the winter and cotton ones on in the summer
1	mm
1	and then i stopped bothering with the cotton ones because actually even in the summer it s not particularly warm vocal desc laugh in this country
1	no
1	erm and i just like the feel of flannelette pause dur short but i would ve had at least one fitted bottom sheet i mean i would have had two now i ve a vague recollection of one tearing and i don t quite know how i i i never quite knew how it had torn whether it was in the washing machine and if so on what or or you know but
1	bit unusual that
1	yeah but as i say i would have had two because i d have been alternating so i don t know but
1	mm
1	the last time anon nametype m type name stayed here i realised i didn t have one erm and anon nametype f type name s coming for a night in december
1	oh
1	erm she s doing what she did last time which is come over
1	has she been here
1	no she s seen photos but she came pause dur short well in the spring sometime i can t quite remember when and do you remember i went over to manchester airport and met her in a caf at the airport
1	oh yes
1	at the airport sort of thing
1	yes
1	because she was trunc goi trunc she s got a great aunt who lives pause dur short well west of the airport rather than east of so she was going there for lunch which is why i met her for morning coffee er but this time she s going to visit the great aunt and then come over here for a night and then go down south to her sister erm because she s basically doing her christmas visits at the beginning of december because they are house sitting for a friend in italy for two months from something like the nineteenth of december to some time in february
1	great
1	very nice in umbria erm cos they ve actually invited me to go over pause dur short in my christmas holiday their friend anon nametype f type name who normally spends christmas with them is going er and they said there s enough trunc s trunc space in this house for me to be there at the same time or after her cos
1	mm
1	the last time i went which is at least two christmases ago if not three it trunc w trunc i went when anon nametype f type name left if you see what i mean
1	mm
1	because they ve only got one spare room with unclear
1	you know anon nametype f type name
1	no i ve never met her because
1	oh
1	vocal desc laugh we we ve always sort of done this in and out thing you know
1	yeah
1	because well at their flat they they ve basically got a spare bedroom i mean they ve got they ve each got a study in theory it s a four bedroomed flat
1	mm
1	but that s what they were looking for because they ll each like to have a study so i suppose they could put up a camp bed in one of the studies
1	mm
1	erm but pause dur short so no so i don t think i ve ever met her erm
1	so are you thinking you ll go
1	well pause dur short my first thought was it would make sense to go she s going out pretty much the day after they arrive i think about something like the twentieth of december and staying till something like the second of january that s what anon nametype m type name said and i was thinking if i went sometime between christmas and new year and stayed a bit longer than her i we could overlap and then you know then they re not pause dur short then they haven t got the whole of the first fortnight that they re in their new place with visitors i think that s a bit much really
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short but then i realised the second of january is when i m going to see this consultant
1	oh
1	so that doesn t really fit and at the moment pause dur short unless i can get my stomach under control it s not really very comfortable i wouldn t be very comfortable being in somebody else s house
1	mm
1	it s so bad
1	i m surprised that coffee doesn t upset your stomach
1	well i don t i it does if i have more in an afternoon that s why i don t
1	mm pause dur short cos it s quite fierce
1	yes pause dur short erm pause dur short but so i just don t know we ll trunc s trunc oh i sort of left it as well the other thing was pause dur short vocal desc sigh he said i could fly to rome but perugia is nearer pause dur short only of course that s a small airport and there are flights from stansted well i don t want the you know ryanair of something i don t want to drive down to stansted in order to fly to perugia but otherwise he would drive to rome to pick me up and it s a something like a hundred and fifty kilometres well i don t really want to land him with doing that now so in er i didn t say much but at the time i was thinking oh that s making me feel awkward
1	mm
1	and i looked and there really weren t any flights to perugia from a from anywhere reasonable up here erm cos i was hoping that there would be from erm unclear skittle unclear and then i could do i could go from leeds bradford you know
1	mm
1	in a double thingy but
1	well the thing is you will be driving in the worst of our weather to get to an airport here
1	yes so i don t know i want to go from anywhere but leeds
1	there were quite a lot of flights cancelled this last week because of fog in the south
1	mm yeah pause dur short but er
1	mm lost my ring on the unclear
1	i mean when i went to rome i think there was it there was a jet two flight from direct from leeds to rome which would be the best option but i tried to check that and they weren t coming up so i don t really know about that so that s all a bit in the air
1	mm
1	what would be fantastic would be if this consultant did do a friday afternoon and i could get in to see her sooner than that
1	is there is that on the cards
1	well i didn t i say that her secretary said she would get back to me if
1	oh yes
1	i even wonder if it would be worth in another week or so ringing up the trunc secretar trunc i ve think i ve still got the secretary s number somewhere a direct line
1	yes i think it would be
1	and saying has that rota been sorted out yet and so on because
1	cos you re making a just a polite query aren t you
1	well trunc y trunc you see anon nametype f type name used to do that she used to ring up and natter and she did get things done and sometimes she got things sorted that should have been sorted but wouldn t have been if you know
1	mm
1	somebody should have let somebody know something or a note
1	mm
1	should have been sent on and that sort of thing erm pause dur short so yes i think i will be i ll i ll pause dur short i will give it a week or two because actually that secretary did respond she if you remember pause dur short erm she was away when i first rang up and somebody took the call and left her a note and she did get back to me
1	oh
1	so she obviously is fairly efficient
1	mm
1	but
1	yeah pause dur short so what s for the rest of the day then
1	well as is say i want to mow the lawn this afternoon erm and i think that that those orange roses have pretty much finished and i m going to cut them back a bit because pause dur short one of them had grown very tall pause dur short erm and nearly blew over in in
1	mm
1	the strong wind so pause dur short mm
1	well i look out of the window as i pull the curtains back each morning and see which of my roses has got a flower bud on that might come out
1	mm vocal desc laugh those little white ones look as if they have still got trunc s trunc er buds on actually
1	yes
1	i might have another blooming of those
1	i ve a pink one that with a sort of open rose that er it i think it was bought as ground cover
1	mm
1	and that s done extremely well this year but it needs to spread a bit
1	mm
1	it s got a fair space around it i know what i was going to say to you i was talking to anon nametype f type name about this buddleia that you know you re going to take
1	mm
1	and she said er oh i ve never seen a white buddleia
1	oh
1	er but i ve got an orange one
1	good heavens
1	mm
1	but you see that one of mine was supposed to be orangey yellow that s actually turned out white
1	well i ve never seen that
1	no
1	anywhere
1	well it was it it didn t say buddleia it was trunc call trunc it had a name
1	oh
1	but when you looked at the latin name it was a it was a something but it it that was where i saw the buddleia bit
1	right
1	erm pause dur short and it s definitely smaller than the other buddleias that i got
1	so it s presumably the same family but
1	mm
1	slightly off
1	mm well except that what i ve actually got isn t what i was supposed to have clearly
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short yeah
1	yeah there s a lot of butterfly activity today pause dur short i mean i ve been trunc look trunc
1	i ve noticed it while i ve been here
1	mm i ve been looking in the trunc butterfl trunc in a butterfly book a lot since i came here because i do seem to see quite a few and quite a lot of them say something like april may and august september in other words
1	oh
1	they seem to have two periods when the when they re active and i don t quite know what that s about
1	well now i ve cut my buddleia back which was only a few days ago there s not a lot for em to come to out of my kitchen window
1	mm
1	which is where i look
1	well i was obviously was looking to see trunc co trunc also not just in my butterfly book but in that gardening for wildlife book to see what they need
1	mm
1	and quite a lot of them lay their eggs on nettles lovely vocal desc laugh
1	yes i think i knew that
1	erm but quite a few of them ivy well of course there s tonnes of ivy over there on that that is a wall there that looks like a hedge
1	oh
1	erm
1	right
1	so that may be one reason why i i ve there ve been a lot of butterflies trunc com trunc coming here ever since i moved in you know it was not anything i ve done particularly
1	it never stops does it the garden
1	no
1	there s always something you have to do
1	well no things like creating pause dur short something suitable for wildlife a lot of it you you do it and leave it
1	mm
1	it s either
1	mm
1	making sure you ve got the right plants in or things like you know i ve got quite a few pieces of stone that i ve just sort of piled under those trees down there at the end of the garden
1	yeah
1	that isn t in the bit that isn t really being used so that things might hibernate
1	ah right
1	you know
1	yes
1	erm
1	like slugs
1	well preferably not like slugs but
1	vocal desc laugh i haven t had any in the kitchen lately i think for about a fortnight
1	well
1	and i was seeing them quite often
1	mm
1	yeah well i suppose i d better make my way home it was still busy at anon type place sunday morning
1	oh i didn t tell you i was i was in well it was the anon type place festival that s why
1	oh yes yes
1	erm i was manning a stall there yesterday for the rspb
1	oh right of what information
1	well they sell things and erm a tombola that was kind of aimed at kids
1	mm
1	erm i mean
1	was
1	it wasn t a tombola it was actually a bag vocal desc laugh
1	lucky dip
1	vocal desc laugh yes but erm
1	was it well attended
1	yes cos i the first year that i joined the local group i went along to do to help them with that and it was a nasty wet day and we got hardly anybody and it was really not good at all well did i say i ve joined the committee
1	no
1	i thought well i m not doing the theatre any more so i can do it and he s trunc al trunc he was always been asking for extra committee members erm trunc n trunc you know there are people who are willing to help with the tea and coffee at the meetings and things like that but nobody wants to sign up for the committee erm and he had been i say he cos because there s one bloke called anon nametype m type name whose wife does stuff as well erm and everybody else is female erm and he is the leader and until this year he was the treasurer as well now somebody has stepped up to be treasurer erm so i went to the first meeting and said you know i ll i m volunteering for the committee i mean it obviously it s between agms but they they can do that relatively informally it s not like anon type miscpersonalinfo i had to fill a form in that goes off to
1	mm
1	er hq erm so there was a committee meeting last monday erm partly to sort things out for this so we did a rota and i was doing one till three
1	mm
1	which actually was a bit of an awkward time cos i thought well then how when do i eat so in the end i walked down cos i thought that ll give me my exercise for the day and i went i was going to go to anon type place but i ended up going to is it the anon type place a caff on that same thing as the anon type place unclear
1	there s a new italian one i think
1	well i wouldn t have said it was italian but well
1	no
1	yes it had pasta but
1	the reason i haven t been but i met anon nametype f type name by chance and she was meeting a friend in this italian one and i said i didn t even know there was an italian one
1	well there s there s i passed somewhere else that i would have called a caff and of course there s anon type place which wasn t open at lunchtime
1	oh
1	erm and the terrace and this all along that one little stretch erm i mean in fact there were quite a lot of things down in anon type place but i didn t quite know what there would be there so i i deliberately walked at that row and
1	there s a something called anon type place the other side of the road
1	right well where anon type place has got the ground floor and upstairs this has got the ground floor and actually a basement which i only discovered when i went down to the toilet and realised there were more seats there are more tables down there
1	oh oh
1	erm very nice erm pause dur short pasta and hot sandwiches and that sort of thing you know
1	mm
1	and relatively light bites but erm a reasonable range and and pause dur short it fresh and good chips anon nametype m type name would ve liked them i mean er it was a bit much for me really i didn t really want the chips as well but
1	mm
1	erm so i did that and had quite an early lunch and then
1	yeah
1	went down to this store and yeah mm it was
1	did i tell you that i fell in the house
1	no
1	it was quite funny actually in fact it was ridiculous er what happened i d had i d put the fire on and i must have slightly dozed off it was after dinner and i tend to do this each afternoon now and suddenly realised it was time to go tell anon nametype m type name what time it was and the fire was on and it needed to go off so i stood up pause dur short to head towards the fire which is about three steps
1	mm
1	and my foot must have gone to sleep and i found i was spinning round
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i grabbed the fan was there and i grabbed the fan and i grabbed this that and the other and i ended up sitting in the wastepaper basket
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well i sat there and sort of laughed to myself cos i wasn t hurting anywhere
1	i mean you were flipping lucky that you weren t vocal desc laugh
1	and i couldn t get up i thought i can t sit here till anon nametype m type name gets up vocal desc laugh
1	well you could have shouted i suppose
1	well i could yes eventually i i got enough strength to to push on but there s nothing much to push on there
1	no
1	i mean you can t push on a wastepaper basket
1	no
1	to get up and the fan was there
1	well i suppose you could have tilted yourself over and crawled
1	oh i thought of all those things
1	vocal desc laugh
1	eventually i did it but i was telling anon nametype f type name about it cos she came two or three days afterwards and she said you really should slow down as you get up
1	mm
1	sort of every time and i m afraid i am doing that i m getting up and standing just for a second or two
1	mm
1	till i know my feet are working
1	mm
1	so it s this leg that i haven t fully got control over now i m afraid so
1	mm
1	you ll be wheeling me out one of these days
1	you ll be lucky
1	well you could carry me out in the wastepaper basket
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh i mean
1	it s a great shame there wasn t anybody there with a camera vocal desc laugh
1	it it s i sat there and i thought this is daft and i actually started to laugh
1	well but you were lucky that you didn t crack your head on the wall or something at that point
1	well yes and there s the corner of the erm pause dur short whatever the chest is that s there
1	yeah yeah
1	that s got the clock on and so on
1	yeah yeah
1	anon nametype m type name said you were lucky you didn t hit that corner somewhere
1	mm yes
1	and i didn t hurt anything but it made me feel helpless
1	mm
1	and i don t like that
1	yeah
1	in which case i had better go home
1	yeah
1	and do something i don t know what

0	unclear
0	mm
0	yeah anon nametype m type name
0	come on cos like yeah i ve pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn t ve thought i would ve as well as pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn t want me to ve pushed him at
0	that s cool
0	yeah
0	how you teach that to people i think is a really interesting question dilemma isn t it
0	so just like what s the main points here
0	reflects from it so then they re learning the bible they re reading out the bible but they re not just doing that and thinking okay so that s what it meant back then they re trunc s trunc going right what does that mean now
0	yeah
0	so i ll show you some examples unclear in a minute but yeah it s been cool watching them do that and then as well cos that s on the board afterwards i get them to pray
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	mm
0	okay
0	but it s been good
0	sounds like erm you ve nailed a lot in the last year unclear unclear sounds unclear unclear
0	do you know what i mean
0	but it s been nice to trunc h trunc just have that flexibility to say i trust you to do this if you want to you can
0	yeah that s unclear cool unclear
0	so it just means that i don t have to do so much
0	so it means that i ve got more flexibility again to say oh i can do this now
0	so like drumming and
0	yeah i haven t done a i haven t drummed on sunday mornings except from unclear the all age unclear
0	so that s been good but it s also been nice just to spend some time thinking unclear well okay unclear what s unclear god unclear trying to say in this service
0	yeah yeah
0	it s just more flexible isn t it
0	that s good though
0	okay
0	mm
0	and you join
0	is that good or bad do you reckon or would you prefer it if it was the same band
0	unclear that s good unclear
0	unclear
0	but yeah that s been unclear cool unclear so i had like that once a week and then lead occasionally
0	yeah yeah unclear i think they were unclear
0	cos unclear they were just like wouldn t have a clue unclear
0	whereas like if i play with you that s good
0	mm
0	but we can bounce off ideas off each other and like
0	yeah
0	i don t know what you do if you unclear
0	unclear just as we go unclear vocal desc laugh
0	go yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	what would you say like the the if you could trunc s trunc say there s someone who s fifteen who s gonna try and start worship leading what would you say for when he s practising what would your first best tip would be for him
0	ah that s a great question pause dur short i d like to hear yours as well
0	yeah pause dur long
0	okay that s cool
0	yeah
0	erm and worship like when you re on your own erm worship when someone else is leading who you want to be
0	i think you ve done well there i think like you said worship worship worship in terms of
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah erm in terms of yeah what you ve got to do some people try and listen to too much music and get it wrong that way cos they re
0	mm
0	but they forget they re actually on a stage cos it s worshiping god they re trying to worship songs
0	unclear
0	but in terms of listening i think that s really important cos
0	mm
0	yeah
0	taught me how to play
0	vocal desc laugh
0	that would be genius
0	some i had i learnt how to play
0	but then erm after a while i had a few lessons but that was reading music it wasn t how to play
0	erm but yeah that was probably for about a year maybe
0	cos now you re really good really good vocal desc laugh
0	unclear oh okay
0	if you put a sheet in front of me i d be able to figure it out roughly but i wouldn t
0	yeah
0	but i find people who learn how to play drums through lessons in terms of music aren t always the best at playing
0	okay yeah
0	yeah yeah you gotta anticipate like the closing of a of a section or like
0	and to keep it in time it s a really tricky instrument to play whereas acoustic guitar you can just like fumble around a little bit and
0	unclear
0	yeah vocal desc laugh yeah
0	g shapes
0	yeah unclear unclear it is good unclear
0	unclear okay unclear
0	unclear erm oh okay unclear

0	yeah
0	or trunc s trunc or a church and you re you re on their team
0	yeah
0	it is kind of good it s kind of a noble idea actually
0	and saying how it s so important that we need so many different people erm just in terms of instead of obviously saying we need we need a vicar we need a worship leader cos obviously that s fairly self explanatory
0	as well as we need people working in the church for the outside church as well as people who come to the church for the outside church
0	okay yeah yeah
0	oh that s cool
0	are we in the church out the church
0	are you where do you where do you fit yourself
0	yeah
0	in that chain but not really outreaching
0	unclear yeah yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah it s really hard been trying to figure out how i should be in how it is
0	especially as there s less of leaders so obviously it s easier to remember names

0	it s pause dur short apparently per trunc hundr trunc two twenty two grams of sugar per hundred grams is high

0	i hadn t even spoke to him when he sent me that i hadn t even spoke to him for like
0	two weeks i think

0	it just felt really weird i felt like i literally felt like i was going faint it was horrible
0	yeah

0	anon nametype m type name s twenty five and i m twenty four
0	i don t know about you but i m feeling not twenty two anymore
0	feeling twenty five
0	let s not make that an issue like let s just assume that don t have to make a big deal out of it
0	okay enough said
0	i don t know how cold it s gonna be out on this balcony for the beer
0	oh it s locked at the top there
0	something an old curtain or a towel
0	maybe the kitchen cos we re not gonna be out here for a while are we
0	so i ll grab a curtain for us to sit down on
0	no i know pause dur short we should have paid attention to that a little bit
0	that one see i think like that s
0	oh well whatever
0	that ll be fine where s the beer then
0	yeah that would be better wouldn t it
0	yeah i left the beer in the freezer
0	i ve got the tobacco are we just sharing the bottle
0	maybe
0	there s two behind you

0	event desc unintelligible yeah we ve got those in event desc unintelligible
0	oh nice we ve got a bunch of stuff pause dur short our family do know how to pause dur short equip us
0	pornographic ashtray
0	we re not those people
0	do you want to take this
0	what do you need that for
0	i was gonna sit on the windowsill
0	alright i ll sit here then yeah can you get out there
0	yeah
0	i mean most likely they didn t do it and it s been there for ages
0	no none of them really
0	either you have it or you don t basically
0	i imagine it causes some dispute pause dur short or ideally you own both rooms
0	so it would be nice if this if this was
0	that person might they ve got potted plants on both sides
0	yeah i feel like they have
0	if we started using their windowsill would they be alright with that
0	yeah that s true
0	if you just put a hobbyhorse on this balcony
0	i mean they shouldn t blow over this railing er
0	it gets pretty windy here but yeah i guess not
0	the natural sun on that side as well
0	what a hobbyhorse
0	yeah trunc wh trunc
0	cos we are gonna
0	a dyas or whatever it is
0	hooks yeah pause dur short oh we ll have to go back there and have a look then
0	there are hills around there
0	because people sit out on their balconies shouldn t be nosy it should be seen as being neighbourhoody
0	yeah
0	becomes unclear for on show part of the the vibe around here isn t it
0	see these ones all have conversions those ones have conversions on both windows can you see
0	because you could easily live on a busy road
0	yeah you could which would be weird seeing people in traffic going by all the time
0	it does
0	well just from the outside as you said it s a clear indication that the it s not vacant
0	and they ve got nets i guess over there now
0	how do we get all that installed that is hooks and rope and like
0	that might hold it more
0	the shelves might be still in need at that point
0	no you don t this is our pub
0	foreign lang und
0	arriba abajo foreign
0	i think people are might be a bit envious if we do another year in africa or something
0	wouldn t rule out turkey still if a good position came up just to still have a
0	they re two years in those contracts now aren t they
0	unclear we ve just unclear anon nametype n type name and anon nametype n type name again especially if we re going to go and visit them
0	if we ve got the money we should definitely try and go
0	mm
0	mm
0	depends when we go i guess if we go in august or something pause dur short i mean we can always
0	i imagine the flights might be a bit cheaper in july
0	we can always do a erm pause dur short summer programme somewhere to earn some quick hard cash
0	it depends how your dissertation
0	one thing reminds you of something else but you know
0	is if we specialist slightly differently pause dur long
0	mm
0	so it s not a big deal pause dur short she said you can but maybe she said after the first week
0	yeah
0	i know in the very very first week i did i took a class in history and i didn t have a i just was so what i didn t know what she was talking about
0	the first year
0	anon nametype m type name might bring anon nametype m type name up on the train that s if he ever has the money
0	faster for your parents to drive up to the m than it is to just drive across
0	then going through the only thing is anon nametype m type name said it s just the only problem is it is quicker but it s touch and go because it only takes one accident on the motorway
0	yeah yeah it s alright not a problem
0	it s a little bit chilly on the old feet
0	yeah i ve got goose pimples
0	mm
0	it might be warmer the other side of the sun
0	it s very changeable isn t it that s it
0	oh someone from anon type miscpersonalinfo maybe pause dur short could be
0	could be like inventory

0	yeah vocal desc laugh it s pretty dirty
0	it s a big weathered isn t it
0	and replace this unclear door handle unclear
0	yeah i think so
0	shall i open a window it s
0	yeah that would be good
0	yeah pause dur short good idea
0	doesn t have to be open much does it don t think anyone can get in through there
0	i know yeah
0	for the time that they are
0	event desc unintelligible
0	oh there you go are they taking photos for us
0	no i think just er any retrieved photographs accompanying the report will be noted adjacent to the relevant copy something like that we ve got seven days to check it when does that leave us until
0	oh yeah
0	i mean we have paid for this company to do this they should be thorough
0	oh yeah
0	that s good so they can t come around and be like what have you done you left this on
0	no well
0	just says heavy mildew surrounding edge of glass panes i mean if we re gonna take some photos i mean er pause dur short and talk about it
0	so if they just if we just accepted it as it is and the landlord won t actually because where do you get a shelf from for a fridge
0	these pictures are rubbish anyway
0	what is that even of where is that
0	the stove top
0	things very patched up there
0	just dirt or just wear wear and tear
0	not quite no just move them over there and then erm i ll wire them
0	no but you have one you have to stick it to the back
0	not both of them i don t think maybe one of them i m not sure
0	so this one this one isn t attached okay
0	in here
0	and something probably er don t need to plug it in yet do we
0	just to make sure it works and put this away
0	so you can charge your your mp player via this as well you don t need to i mean you can do it on your computer obviously does that have
0	yeah put it on here
0	you threw it as it s it s between your feet
0	now these speakers haven t been used for about six years
0	the power s on so that s the half promising
0	hopefully it ll work
0	see if it s pause dur long
0	it s not very loud or
0	it s erm it works
0	and once they re hooked up to the i mean we can t have music too loud here anyway
0	no
0	we ve got all kinds of neighbours that we have to think about
0	at least we won t have people round
0	i wonder how many properties you can have round here
0	shall i make another rollie
0	there are
0	yeah pause dur short i think so
0	it probably does
0	should have probably grabbed at argos catalogue while we were there
0	is argos
0	yeah is it the cheapest of places until we get the internet we re in a bit of limbo really and until you get back form dorset
0	it s rubbish
0	i m sure that s important the steam fair
0	just to build a relationship or whatever
0	my mum wants you up for christmas if that s possible
0	but erm yeah obviously i ll come up maybe the week before christmas
0	i don t think they re expecting you to come up either erm bearing in mind that i ve got two families as well

0	why isn t any we don t have any like pieces of er cable attachments for cameras that we don t use that we can string across that that erm oh it s all attached isn t it
0	i m not gonna sleep in there until we get something sorted cos it s too bright and i ll see what it s like with the curtains closed tonight
0	yeah
0	well not with that other door exposed
0	yeah sun s gone in now anyway
0	more or less
0	of course it is it s england it s fleeting and
0	too big
0	erm pause dur short it s certainly cheaper than the mince we were buying that s five hundred grams for two pounds
0	that s pretty good
0	yeah that s fine
0	seems to have done quite a few hours pause dur short it s pretty good where s the lighter
0	oh all the boxes are here though for sitting on
0	no they re not you re not gonna be able to sit on that
0	move it out the way
0	that glass there you get it
0	no one out here is there
0	but one of the people anon nametype f type name who lives around here she might know so we ll just have to go into the office pause dur short well he said to ring them i said i d probably just
0	pop in yeah
0	yeah trying to let you settle in your mum s like oh leave her alone is she working today

0	it s a bit really long she doesn t come back very happy
0	i d say she hasn t been used to working but she s been doing a lot for them well she as doing a lot for your nan
0	mm
0	so she needs to keep working
0	so you know like in in america where they
0	oh yeah there s no
0	yeah yeah
0	we do the same
0	yeah
0	specsavers trunc re trunc retracted it because too many people took liberties
0	so he doesn t actually get sick pay
0	said i think that s illegal in england isn t it
0	what did he say
0	don t know apparently not they re not gonna be breaking that law
0	it s terrible
0	stuff just seems to be getting tighter and tighter doesn t it jobs don t seem to be getting better
0	i know and if you re gonna take away people s sick pay well then just be like look we ll meet you in the middle and we ll give you six days sort trunc o trunc extra vacation
0	yeah
0	teaching especially when i had some trunc ser trunc basically migraines i m pretty sure
0	yeah
0	it s pretty horrible just teaching when your head is pounding and you ve got to perform and you ve got to talk to people
0	it s terrible
0	yeah it does depend on the class and the course pause dur short got through it though and the conversation programme came and went didn t it
0	it really did yeah six weeks of that was pretty quick
0	they weren t difficult days were they
0	no probably won t in any job for a while
0	or the job after that
0	by the sounds of things in saudi they make you work full days
0	mm
0	anon nametype m type name yeah the doctor
0	missus they re married now anon nametype f type name anon nametype m type name and somebody else anon nametype m type name all asked my dad like within a day of me us posting that is anon nametype m type name married like anon nametype f type name wrote it up or something and so did anon nametype m type name
0	mm
0	yeah
0	teach together pretty much and have always lived together how more married can you be other than having children
0	guess people must think that we do to have done it
0	yeah
0	yeah look at that side
0	oh it doesn t matter
0	shut up whatever
0	it is really scratched
0	i can see that trunc scr trunc scratch
0	probably wasn t the best idea
0	and do you know what i haven t even been wearing it at home very much
0	yeah
0	no pause dur long
0	well we re still being paid
0	the exchange rate s good at the minute i hope it stays that
0	so yeah i remember the same old thing in our
0	mm pause dur short she definitely she has to go through the rigmarole of hiring
0	anon nametype f type name s going to be greeting some other people in her way
0	yeah she ended up being a funny one didn t she
0	yeah
0	oh he is leaving yeah
0	he said to me to yeah it s all changing pause dur short erm her and anon nametype m type name obviously get on really well
0	she s a proper alcoholic vocal desc laugh
0	yeah anon nametype f type name
0	yeah
0	cos yeah i can t trunc im trunc i can t picture them in
0	there s a lot of wine there
0	she clicks and she s a different person pause dur short very very repetitive
0	ah
0	yeah
0	where was that
0	and it s where anon nametype m type name s band kept playing
0	no and it might explain why she doesn t go out
0	we were drinking quite heavily including
0	anon nametype f type name yeah we were all drinking quite heavily just taking a lot of shots of whiskey in the park or whatever and pause dur short i didn t like anon nametype f type name in the end
0	oh right then yeah
0	yeah well they just didn t
0	i mean that was fine and her tea party sucked
0	that was terrible vocal desc laugh i don t like you didn t wear a dress
0	it wasn t there was nothing mad about that tea party
0	well we kicked it into gear i think when we arrived
0	yeah
0	mm
0	i presume she is cos they ve just got married didn t they
0	er to teach though they may they may be just transferring or
0	i know didn t sound like it
0	and they don t have that much experience they ve got no post celter experience pause dur short they
0	they ve been basically done a few months
0	and they re like well actually i quite liked korea event desc sound of children i reckon they are going back i reckon they ve just weighed up some things and probably had a few job interviews or tried to get into places and didn t pause dur short that s ah it s great though korea is too easy
0	and they ll do another couple of years there and then they ll er
0	we could have got in at unclear what do you think that would have been like pause dur long
0	not having any office hours is amazing why don t all jobs do that
0	i know it s just do your job and make sure you do your job cos i don t know pause dur short they don t know when they need you it depends on the type of job
0	mm
0	your compounds and event desc unintelligible
0	having three years in the public school system in korea was a bit trippy
0	yeah i did do three years in there
0	no vocal desc laugh not at all
0	there s no job like we re the same you and i
0	you re in the classroom and you re in the school those teachers are the people that you know
0	we did became we we did get a trunc li trunc we got so intertwined us four that entwined that
0	trunc in trunc intertwined it s
0	yeah to the point where we knew different teachers and
0	yeah yeah
0	that you knew she s talking about and anon nametype m type name s talking about the same people that you had so we can talk to them about it and still know who anon nametype n type name is and anon nametype n type name anon nametype n type name pause dur long ah it s amazing
0	no
0	i think
0	you know my idea before the learners teach themselves the teachers move about between the classrooms and you always have at least two teachers in the class at any one time but sometimes there could be three as people move in and change but you re constantly moving and making sure
0	mm
0	and you get to know the students more pause dur short even if you even just have four rooms just for listening or reading and speaking or whatever or just like different activities do you know what i mean where they come on and there s like a you can have a pre made instruction video or something er something that they get they open they discuss as a group in english
0	yeah and they do
0	you don t have to
0	and you know that you can be evaluated all the time because there s pause dur short you know like you know that the teachers can see through these windows you can t see through them
0	mm
0	it s like two way do you know what i mean and the teachers come in and out and they just make sure that you re understanding and getting on with what you re doing pause dur short and everyone has a different role
0	it might make pause dur short well how big would the classes be do you think
0	you wouldn t tell them what it was but there were different rooms for different things and you were running different things on
0	and then you can do a little bit of teaching in that to that small group
0	you ve got two teachers per room so you ve got eight teachers you can probably get a maximum of twelve students in each class
0	eight sixteen twenty four
0	five and
0	eight sixteen twenty four thirty two forty
0	forty eight it s six
0	forty eight yeah so it s six
0	alright so they can just come and go
0	erm well provided there s no more than the forty eight provided you re not
0	oh so they don t know what class they re going into beforehand
0	themselves and that s it
0	that s true and people would move in and try something else
0	it s all really active and task based but completely down to their own learning and what they wanna do
0	and you could have it in like two hour slots so you change so effectively everyone runs the same things that day but you er you just change the rooms or you have more things going on you d need a variety of resources to
0	yeah i don t know
0	yeah like take good care of them
0	you just come in and pay that
0	mm
0	and like you know and try and make a dialogue for what they think is being said
0	yeah
0	you could have them have their own recommendations as well for things they wanna do and do make an effort to include some of those things in it so that if someone says you know they wanna do this instead of that then you know a week or two trunc l trunc later you do actually put it in
0	i mean it
0	you re not gonna you will learn faster if you re just more willing to participate
0	so yeah doing the drama thing kind of forces everyone to do that
0	mm
0	they have to memorise it
0	mm
0	mm
0	you definitely have to comprehend it to be able to correct it pause dur short and they can be creative and write their own ones
0	vocal desc laugh
0	no
0	les miserables
0	a few of them did
0	mm pause dur short i never watched it obviously but pause dur short it was all to do with russell crowe as a royal marine vocal desc laugh
0	and i guess be besotted with them without it being sexual
0	because koreans definitely didn t know it
0	yeah
0	you have a craving for it yeah
0	you crave it yeah i fancy is a crave isn t it really
0	mm
0	yeah
0	quite compelling want
0	which is why we fancy people because when we see them it s the same immediate oh
0	erm transient not lasting very long pause dur short so when you have a fancy with someone like an addiction
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh it s a bit strange that
0	mm
0	girl girls are horrible boys are horrible oh you know i get because in your sub conscious i guess you know that you are meant to get together
0	and it s a bit strange cos you re a bit like trunc wh trunc why oh girls are horrible that can t be right vocal desc laugh you re like having a bit of a rebellion and
0	i don t know you get taught it at school by someone someone s
0	vocal desc laugh someone s carrying the event desc unintelligible

0	yeah yeah and it s just a better layout in general isn t it
0	of course we re going to we re adults those kind of questions they ask are
0	you know like that guy i was trying to sell the bike to the guy was telling me well then how can you have a kitchen in there that s illegal

0	yeah
0	yeah go on then

0	oh any good
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	ingredients yeah i guess we ll try in the halfway point pause dur short got to take it from there decrease and increase
0	maybe we ll have to
0	right this thing needs much more of a clean
0	that can be done
0	must be
0	hopefully not it s electric hopefully just pause dur short we ll just heat this through turn it off separate it what are we actually separating this into pause dur short
0	but how big are they are they gonna fit in our fridge i don t think so
0	it s a good rice one
0	and a beer
0	yeah what s that look like to you
0	i m not eating it

0	i hope you re incorrect love
0	he was sixteen
0	mm pause dur short barely
0	yes he came to arsenal his first game was the twentieth of january pause dur short two thousand and six
1	so i ve been looking at superstitions for a class tomorrow
1	okay
1	you believe in trunc s trunc in good luck and bad luck don t you
1	erm i believe in good luck and bad but i know it s something you can just perceive you you can get down on yourself and think erm you know i never get any luck pause dur short but i and i and i believe statements like i make your own luck certainly pause dur short but just outrageous bits of bad fortune trunc y trunc don t happen to everyone the an accident
1	mm
1	or something that you couldn t ve foreseen pause dur short or er but but i do believe that some people if you put yourself in a situation trunc d trunc too often you unclear perceive unclear that you re unlucky if bad things happen to you pause dur short and if you keep doing the wrong things or things that you know are a fifty fifty you know chance or or worse that you re gonna come and you can you can have a bad run of of doing seemingly
1	things go wrong yeah
1	things seem trunc s trunc going wrong pause dur short so i think it s just something that if you trunc d trunc if you do the right things then it will presume or or certainly other people think oh he s a lucky person pause dur short because he s he you know he s trunc g trunc put himself in that position to get luck and and it s more likely to be good than bad
1	yeah
1	because the trunc p trunc ps the place he s put himself is is a good place so
1	yeah pause dur short do you walk under ladders and things like that
1	no i don t pause dur short i i yes i i wouldn t say i deliberately do it but i really erm i really don t believe in that sort of thing i mean apart from the fact that if any you trunc gr trunc go to any trunc b trunc close to a building site or what have you there s more chance of a bucket falling on you than than than if you were not walking unclear really unclear
1	yeah it s kind of erm you know but but if you broke a mirror for example would you immediately think oh that s good you know that s seven years bad luck
1	no i wouldn t
1	no
1	i don t think mind you i i ve never trunc t trunc actually tested it on myself
1	vocal desc laugh
1	cos i don t think i ve ever actually broken one
1	yeah pause dur short trunc d trunc were your parents superstitious did they throw salt over their shoulder and stuff like that
1	no no
1	no
1	pepper not salt
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short you are joking
1	mm
1	yeah pause dur short and
1	yeah
1	and what about erm trunc w trunc in gambling what sort of things do you do to bring luck
1	erm
1	do you cross your fingers or
1	i tell you what actually trunc u trunc i kept winning and i i give to beggars anyway
1	yeah
1	but er not all the time but sometimes and but but i i kept winning and i thought to myself that i go inside of anon type place on the same place and trunc t trunc and gave money two or three times
1	mm
1	to this guy pause dur short and one time he wasn t even asking vocal desc laugh for any money
1	vocal desc laugh
1	he was just he didn t he didn t have a cup or a bowl or what have you pause dur short he was sitting with his legs you know bunched up in front of him
1	right pause dur short and presumably you recognised him did you
1	yeah pause dur short well no i no i m not even sure it was the same man
1	oh
1	but due to the fact that i d actually thought hello i m being er you know sort of paid back here for for being er nice and generous
1	right
1	but i thought this is absolute nonsense and i didn t wanna go one day through that side and i was a bit later and i wanted to go through the centre of the station pause dur short and i was gonna go out to the side to give this bloke some money
1	mm
1	i trunc d trunc i don t even know if he was there or not and i thought don t be so silly i went down there and still won so
1	oh you still won oh okay yeah vocal desc laugh
1	still won er er so er
1	mm
1	you know that that was good
1	yeah
1	that was good that that something had happened yeah
1	yeah that you did it pause dur short what about in the betting shop generally do people do things to for luck you know do you see people going through rituals or anything
1	oh they do erm they complain about their back luck by kicking the machine and er swearing at the telly and what have you no i think it s er i think you get it more it it s er in sport where one person always puts always to go out last pause dur short or he
1	mm
1	always puts one boot on er you know before the other
1	oh like a footballer trunc u trunc yeah
1	yes footballer
1	yeah
1	he ll always do trunc s trunc things in a certain order
1	yeah
1	er all this sort of stuff
1	yeah
1	or have a lucky you know what people have a trunc l trunc
1	i think i remember bjorn borg pause dur short didn t he
1	mm
1	have a ritual i think he didn t shave for the whole of wimbledon
1	unclear pause dur short they probably
1	so he always ended the wimbledon fortnight with a little beard
1	yeah they they
1	yeah
1	did that i trunc d trunc i trunc d trunc you ve gotta get out of doing these things i mean they said to michael owen i hear you re superstitious and he
1	yeah
1	said no i don t actually i don t believe i m superstitious i just do certain things before a game to ensure that other things don t happen
1	like what
1	well that s he s saying that s exactly what superstitions is
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short yeah but it
1	he s saying he s not trunc s trunc though then he didn t go on to say what they were
1	oh okay yeah
1	but it was just the fact was it trunc f trunc you know it was exactly
1	yes
1	what er
1	yeah
1	yeah and so he was saying that he was superstitious yeah
1	yeah
1	what about you and luck you don t er
1	i don t believe in it at all i just think it s everything s a coincidence really pause dur short but some it s it s quite useful to have erm a way to refer to you know bad coincidences and that so pause dur short you know if you if if something trunc ha trunc if you happen to pick the wrong day you know the of of er a month of brilliant sunshine and you you re having a garden party and you happen to have chosen the day that it pours down with rain then
1	mm
1	you ll think of that as bad luck won t you
1	it s just trunc b trunc it is bad luck
1	yeah
1	though isn t it but it s not
1	yeah
1	there s nothing pause dur short no no one s
1	but you haven t brought it upon yourself or
1	no one you haven t brought on yourself no one s picking
1	yeah
1	on you it s just some things good happen to you and some things bad happen to you
1	yeah and you can t do anything about it so you
1	but if keeps happening to you start getting to think oh god dear why s this
1	you know do you remember that erm friends of mum and dad s called unlucky anon nametype m type name
1	yes pause dur short i didn t pause dur short i never met him i heard you say it
1	no i trunc d trunc i think i only met him once or twice but he had erm all his life had had the most awful bad luck and you know if if he tried to do anything that when he trunc w trunc i think they told us when he was in the army the soldiers used to get up to all sorts of you know little things erm bending the rules and that sort of thing you know but if ever this unlucky anon nametype m type name tried it you know he would
1	yeah
1	always get caught or he d he d choose the night that they were being inspected or you know things like that and erm and he was forever in plaster you know he d turn up to meet them vocal desc laugh
1	unclear sound the unclear trunc f trunc i remember i don t i remember you saying about him or i remember your dad saying about this unlucky anon nametype m type name
1	mm
1	i don t know if you
1	mm
1	you pause dur short but the fact is whether they were laughing with him at him or whether they actually believed it or you know whether
1	no they said you trunc c trunc you can t believe how unlucky somebody that you trunc kn trunc so many things went wrong in his life that he he
1	yeah pause dur short he yeah yeah pause dur short yeah mm
1	and he was about sixty or so so you know he was just used i suppose
1	he trades on trunc h trunc you know on the end er in the end doesn t he you know
1	yeah pause dur short yeah but you know it was it made good chats you know good good stories and so on but
1	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	maybe they weren t all true
1	mm
1	erm a trunc d trunc a lot of people have lucky colours and lucky numbers for doing the lottery and that kind of thing
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short and obviously when you get married you have the something old something new something borrowed something blue stuff and and horse shoes and things like that
1	yeah i mean i really
1	but
1	cos once you get into those things
1	well they re just symbols really they re not actually you know nobody really believes they re going to bring luck unclear and if the unclear oh if you haven t got the something borrowed or
1	mm
1	something blue that s gonna be erm you know bad luck for the future
1	just actually it s erm
1	it s just like a ritual isn t it
1	unclear in the end you think look why don t i just go along with it
1	yeah
1	you know
1	yeah
1	you know and then really because if something did happen
1	yes
1	i might find myself thinking well i was a bit silly why didn t i just you know i
1	yeah
1	i don t trunc b trunc i know it s all daft but er you just don t really wanna get into those things
1	no and and of course to prove how daft the whole thing is
1	mm
1	if you ask people internationally about black cats
1	mm mm
1	you know they re they re mostly bad luck but in our country they re good luck
1	and and we have say lucky number seven or what
1	yeah
1	have you or the trunc un trunc unlucky thirteen but
1	yes
1	they re not exactly the same the world over apparently
1	er well i don t know about the other countries other than italy but in italy it s erm trunc th trunc the unlucky day is seventeenth not thirteenth
1	mm kay
1	and i ve trunc g trunc i might be making this up by i ve got an idea it s tuesday not friday pause dur short so tuesday the seventeenth not friday the thirteenth
1	mm
1	but i don t know if you know
1	trunc cr trunc trunc u trunc trunc d trunc erm australians used to have a unlucky number at cricket
1	oh right what was that then
1	trunc ei trunc eighty seven or something pause dur short trunc th trunc trunc th trunc or or it or or it came to trunc s trunc if it wasn t eighty seven seventy eight so
1	yeah
1	either they would lose a wicket at eighty seven or what have you
1	i m sorry i m not quite sure what i whether i understand that
1	well when they trunc s trunc when the team had scored eighty seven they trunc w trunc
1	oh okay
1	was worried until they got off the number
1	right
1	because it s something would seem to happen when they scored eighty seven pause dur short someone someone had actually suddenly realised kinda we d just scored hundred trunc s trunc i m just out what s the score hundred and seventy four
1	right
1	and someone d go well someone d go that s two eighty sevens innit
1	oh trunc w trunc trunc i trunc trunc u trunc right okay
1	or or two hundred and sixty one
1	yeah that that s like three eighty sevens
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	so you can make what you want of that but you know
1	you d have be good at arithmetic
1	but or or or any australian at cricket pause dur short well actually it might not be eighty seven it might be eighty nine but unclear i don t think unclear
1	vocal desc laugh so it s a number like that
1	there is a number
1	yeah
1	that you know if you think oh christ now eighty seven you know
1	yeah
1	you know you d be very pleased pause dur short if you ve personally scored eighty seven and you get a single to take you onto eighty eight
1	right
1	you d be very pleased
1	trunc ve trunc right and what about
1	yeah
1	erm other sports is it just cricket or
1	no well that s just different things and i suppose some of
1	you know is it but is it like a general number
1	some of them back erm erm probably said do you know do you know the number of times we ve lost a wicket or at the number eighty seven and then you know it just gets one of those things that that just escalates you know
1	oh okay pause dur short mm pause dur short yes yeah
1	i mean obviously there s nothing in it
1	yes
1	but the fact is you know
1	yeah
1	it s cricketers boringly they ve scored ninety you know to get to a hundred at cricket
1	yeah pause dur short sure
1	to get to a hundred is a milestone
1	yeah
1	so blokes play quite beautifully freely until they get to ninety
1	yes
1	and then suddenly they get worried
1	yeah
1	because they ve gotta score the last ten runs they call it the nervous nineties
1	right okay
1	okay so the fact is you could put that unclear batter unclear like like i was i was down i was on ninety five and i got out because you re not playing your normal game because you re worried er that you ll get
1	yes cos of because of the
1	as soon as you get to a hundred and one you start playing normal cricket
1	yes
1	what how daft is that
1	yes
1	and the same is same with someone says christ boy chap you re on eighty seven so you start playing daft you wanna get off you wanna hit a ball you shouldn t hit or it
1	yeah pause dur short yes
1	so it s trunc i trunc everything unclear compounds them i think unclear
1	yeah pause dur short and i and i think that s a bit like in erm in snooker matches was it terry griffiths who always wore his red shirt because he d had a couple of wins wearing this red shirt
1	oh yeah yeah i don t know how many he had of these red shirts
1	trunc w trunc it wasn t just the one then
1	well no but the thing is that they lose as well obviously
1	yeah
1	don t they
1	yeah
1	there was a horse race trainer who would always wear a red shirt
1	yeah
1	now the fact is well you know but the fact is he must ve had bad days when he if he wore it all the time
1	yeah
1	he must ve had a lot of bad days when he was wearing the red shirt
1	mm
1	you know so in the end it s all a bit
1	yes
1	you know i suppose he has even worse luck if he doesn t wear it unclear i don t know unclear
1	yeah pause dur short i know pause dur short but but i suppose if you re and you want to give you maximise your chances then you know
1	you d you would
1	you d wear your lucky red shirt yeah
1	you ll feel happy i suppose with yourself no i trunc c trunc i can t no if i don t do well but i can t least i can t blame my shirt pause dur short i had trunc tho trunc these fortuitous underpants didn t i do you remember
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short oh yes your lucky underpants that s true but they weren t red though were they
1	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short no i trunc s trunc forgot what they were and in fact i don t think there was cos obviously you know i think i had more than one pair
1	i know and you trunc f trunc you forgot in the end which one will they were
1	yeah i don t yeah yeah
1	yeah pause dur short yes pause dur short yeah
1	so you can imagine how easily it can get a grip of you know this sort of stuff
1	yes yes i m glad i m not a slave to it but the erm mrs anon nametype f type name who i used to erm go berserk if anybody put an umbrella up in the office pause dur short really trunc d trunc you know she trunc w trunc she would ve said i trunc d trunc she didn t believe in superstitions but if anybody put an umbrella up she d go put it get it down get it down pause dur short you know so some of it s just kind of ingrained you know
1	mm
1	training or something
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short i know pause dur long
0	vocal desc laugh audio audio tape
0	of what
0	like don t take this the wrong way
0	but but like pause dur short i would
0	i don t think it s necessarily a new thinking to you know what i think it s slightly unclear
0	i know but it s like do you know what i mean
0	vocal desc laugh all the girls
0	yeah like all the girls wanna unclear fuck unclear you
0	no but like do you know when you re told you can t i don t know if you re the same but i am very malcontent like i unclear have unclear something and i want it and i want and i want it and i get it and then i don t want it any more

0	unclear
0	thank you
1	so what do you want to do this afternoon when we get over to your house
1	well we can have a look in one of those another one of those top cupboards
1	mm
1	to see what erm pause dur short ancient treasures there are
1	mm i favour that top cupboard on the right because i think there might be toys in there pause dur short and could it be possible that the garden set is in there you know what i mean by the garden set
1	mm with the little pieces of er brown er well rectangles of brown plastic with holes in but but er
1	it was quite like chocolate really wasn t it
1	yes well it was a bit undulating
1	mm
1	and which you use a little erm plastic pause dur short thing that looks like a fork or spade handle
1	mm
1	with a point on
1	yes
1	because all the flowers had a little erm sort of dimple in them at the bottom so that you could push them in with this implement and make them stand up like tulips and
1	yes yes
1	daffodils and and all sorts of plants
1	well i think the tulips and the daffodils actually had that little hole pause dur short but i think some of them you just pushed in with your fingers
1	mm cabbages you did because they were little heart things
1	oh yes i remember the cabbages
1	like tiny brussels sprouts
1	yes pause dur short we may have had something a bit tall that might have been brussels sprout we had something pause dur short would a brussels sprout have a sort of a a small cabbagey head at the top
1	well a brussels sprout grows up a stem it would have leaves at the bottom and it might have a bit of that on the top but i don t know that we i don t think we had the runner bean because i didn t remember the frames
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short mm i remember something that kept falling over
1	i don t know i can t remember that
1	but the vegetables all came in my time with the garden pond
1	they were later yes
1	whereas you had the erm you had the flower borders and the flowers
1	i think i had the crazy paving
1	yes
1	greenhouse did i have the greenhouse
1	i think so i i do
1	because the greenhouse had little tiny seed trays with i think they had little lines of green things in them or you could put or you could put little lines of green in there but there were some
1	oh yes pause dur short yes pause dur short a bit like false eyelashes
1	yes
1	obviously in green i wonder what happened to my false eyelashes vocal desc laugh
1	trunc they trunc they d be dead once
1	yes i was going to say it was before that time when i was in that false eyelash era
1	and you got little tiny individual flower pots you could push the plants in as well
1	mm pause dur short yes pause dur short and they stood they were erm brown you know the terracotta and they stood in little grey bases with holes in didn t they
1	i think they might have done because they were a bit toppley over otherwise i do believe we i think pause dur short i think there may have been the odd imported farm animal like rabbits and i think the little farm animal rabbits used to go on there and also maybe even the the sheep dog on occasion
1	gosh pause dur short the swan pause dur short oh yes pause dur short and the swan the swan went and i think the round pond was used prior to getting the artistic pond
1	yes pause dur short well it was an improvised turquoisey blue one of the tin lids that push in rather than a pushes out so that it had got colour inside yes i remember that yes i think that was an improvised pond
1	mm pause dur short yes pause dur short yes yes yes pause dur short i imagine that i was given the pond after we got the pond in the garden
1	quite possibly
1	or somewhere linked in that era
1	i didn t start off with a pond because i had the garden set to go with my bayko set which would be considered as a a very dangerous thing for small children to play with now because it had rods metal rods you put in holes and slid the bricks down so there s all those spikey things you can stick yourself on
1	no pause dur short mm pause dur short yes pause dur short yes pause dur short and the flooring that sort of brown sort of not really plastic but something a bit earlier
1	it was green the erm base was a greeny
1	the unclear oh the big green base but i meant
1	you put the poles in
1	you put the poles in and then you put the first floor in
1	yes you had the poles
1	then you put some brown stuff in to support your corners
1	oh yes you you had erm i don t know what it was made of it was it wasn t exactly plastic it was sort of a cross between plastic and a a kind of like erm oil cloth in it it was sort of
1	they probably hadn t invented plastic as we know it we are pre lego here
1	no pause dur short it looked a bit like it looked like a bit something you might unclear like carburettor unclear things with punched holes in vocal desc laugh the old days erm i think yes you put those in for the trunc fl trunc to support just to keep the you had to keep your poles in because if you were doing something tall you had to keep slip they had all little punched holes in so you slid them over your poles so that your upper storey the poles were in the right place to retain the bricks as they slid in because otherwise if you got got taller they could possibly not be as tight at the top as they were at the bottom until you actually put the roof on so you needed some sort of erm intervening strengthening oh and that s right and and it had the different the different roofs and you could have erm er what do you call it you could have erm pause dur short a thing over a bay window er what do you call them a trunc dor trunc not a dormer window erm i ve forgotten the term
1	mm pause dur short velux
1	no it was er like you have over a bay window that you ve got the roof coming down and then you ve got the the angled piece that sticks out over the bay i ve forgotten what they are called now
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short oh pause dur short me too me too
1	one of those anyway you put those fancy bits on the roof to build out a a bay window
1	mm pause dur short ah pause dur short oh yes yes pause dur short you actually stood the roof was a whole thing wasn t it a roof
1	well the big roofs were solid
1	so you had to buy trunc roo trunc you had to build houses to fit your roofs
1	yes but you could only build houses that were on the right grid on a grid pattern you couldn t make a an odd half inch somewhere so it had to be in the proportions of that but you could make up your own there s a whole book of erm designs of houses and castles and things you could garages and all sorts of things you could build but you could do freehand as well as long as you considered what components you d got because i did have several roofs and there were also flat bits that you could make that you could possibly use as a garage or flat or you could put two of them together to make a small er pitched roof i mean pitched you know with a yes and there were different bays and things but i don t know how old that was because it was used before me i think anon nametype m type name s friend anon nametype m type name had bayko because he s the only person i ve ever talked about bayko with because he s only well he s the same age as anon nametype m type name so he was what maybe two years younger than me but he s got older sisters or they may have had it i don t know
1	yes pause dur short no pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short mm mm pause dur short oh pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short oh yes pause dur short mm pause dur short yes because families if you if you are the eldest or youngest it would make a big difference wouldn t it
1	you know so thinking that it was really from another era because i used to play with it when i was quite small you used to play with it when you were quite small didn t you because i used to make houses for the likes of anon nametype m type name and small erm the small pipe cleaner dolls from the dolls house and things i think i used to put those in you know
1	mm pause dur short mm mm pause dur short oh pause dur short mm pause dur short you see i had i had lego too
1	and you had lego yes
1	but lego wasn t as wasn t as adaptable when it first came out because you only had the big size bricks but there s hundreds of ways that they erm but the what are we calling it the building set
1	mm pause dur short you get lego people now don t you mountains and all sorts pause dur short bayko
1	bayko would be dangerous
1	well there was all the small pieces because you could get they were they were quite thin or maybe half inch half inch square but only about quarter of an inch thin they were the ones that slotted in in red and white and then you could get ones that were just half the size of that or even thinner just for doing different bits stripes in brickwork or bits to fill in bays and they were very tiny
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short yes yes yes pause dur short i didn t like the the poles those metal poles
1	and you got different size poles because you are going to need shorter poles for some things
1	yes there was quite a lot to it wasn t there
1	mm that s right because dad made that nice erm box
1	i wonder where he got it from
1	i don t know
1	perhaps somebody at school had it
1	it s possible it could have come from the anon nametype n type name because they were quite well off because it wasn t a cheap toy
1	was he older than you
1	yes
1	oh that would possibly be it then
1	and he was a boy i don t know so it may have come that way i don t think it was anon nametype m type name s because it was quite an expensive toy
1	yes pause dur short mm pause dur short no pause dur short it might have come from the anon nametype n type name
1	or somewhere somebody in that neck of the woods erm
1	yes pause dur short yes and anon nametype m type name wouldn t necessarily pass it on because he d have anon nametype f type name
1	mm that s right
1	but the anon nametype n type name is a possibility isn t it because he was more into more into motors wasn t he that boy
1	and he was an only boy and he hadn t got a brother
1	yes pause dur short when the boy got fed up with it he would pass it on
1	mm pause dur short because it all came in it came in various bits of cardboard boxes and things and father father made that
1	and did father pause dur short yes
1	well he got all the things out and saw how many there were and then constructed the box so it would fit in because you had to put it back in the right compartments
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short anon nametype m type name keeps his screws or has kept his screws in a box of a sort of a similar but had the handle but i think he now keeps them in something because it s alright if you are working all the time on them but there are all sorts of problems like if you you know it doesn t have a top and things
1	yes pause dur short mm pause dur short there are two upstairs with tops of anon nametype m type name s
1	oh anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name s tried lots of different kinds
1	it says transistors up the side but it is er i think he was putting stuff gradually things into them
1	yes well if you have any that will get thrown away it s worth offering them and it s worth thinking around if you could use them for other things like cottons or needles or something
1	mm yes well this is it i mean i ve got i ve got loads of erm nuts and bolts and screws and nails and things that i need to sort of my own because some of my stuff is here and some of my stuff is at anon nametype m type name s and the same with my tools they are in two different places oh i must bring those tools up from the cellar to anon nametype m type name s you know hammers and pliers
1	mm pause dur short yes yes pause dur short yes pause dur short yes lots to do
1	yes i don t want to throw any tools away well not throw them away i don t want to give them away necessarily
1	no pause dur short no you need to sort them out
1	because anon nametype m type name s engineer s tool kit thing he took around with him has got really useful little types of erm long nose pliers and pliers with bent noses which are really useful because you can put them in and pick something out that s not immediately in front of you and so on if you re because they were for going in you know if you want to move little wires in a jumble of wires inside a a computer box you could actually get hold of things so i would like to keep those because i don t know anybody who i could pass them onto really
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short yes pause dur short mm pause dur short no it s all about finding good homes for things
1	i was always using his tool kit so i don t think he would mind
1	anyway i guess we probably ought to be getting ready for going out now what do you think
1	i think so yes if we don t get blown away getting into the car
1	gosh it is really rough out there today isn t it
1	mm i m not going to go along the road with the big trees
1	no
1	that occasionally fall down and bits come off
1	enough trouble with your own trees but we can go round the back can t we
1	yes
1	well okay let me just er tidy this off then
1	yeah pause dur short there you go
1	i m going vocal desc cough it s a silly saying isn t it there you go

0	giraffe
0	yeah
0	yeah like
1	mm
1	so do you wanna know where i went today
1	yes where did you go today this afternoon
1	erm i went basically out to see the people at work photography exhibition which was advertised as being at the anon type place before going on a nationwide tour
1	okay
1	and erm it was er nine photographers were asked to take photos of people at work
1	okay
1	erm and the purpose behind it seems to be to dispel the idea that industry in britain is dead pause dur short because that s the they all said the same thing you know all you hear is that there s no industry the industry s dead and gone and it s not true apparently there s lots of industry pause dur short so they all set out to different parts of the country so you know one one photographer did london somebody else did the north east pause dur short somebody did manchester and so on and they all have different approaches and so on pause dur short erm pause dur short so that s in the anon type place and then going on tour and trunc i trunc actually the anon type place was very busy pause dur short but there was hardly anybody in this exhibition
1	right
1	and it might ve been because nobody could find it pause dur short when i went into the anon type place i asked you know where where is this exhibition and i was told it s on the second floor and given some elaborate erm directions pause dur short and when i did go to the second floor which was actually a bit later on i couldn t find it and i asked somebody and he said oh just go down there turn left follow the you know went round no it wasn t there pause dur short asked trunc some trunc you know a museum official who was up there you know where s this people at work photography exhibition she said trunc n trunc don t know what you re talking about pause dur short the only exhibitions we ve got are these here which were something different pause dur short erm so then i wandered around a bit more found another trunc a trunc official and asked him he said trunc als trunc sent me back the way i came and i said you know i ve got a map of the anon type place so i said you know where on this map is this exhibition and he was still on the second floor going media space in here it s media space and i said er yeah it says media space but it doesn t say the the name of the exhibition pause dur short so he made some excuse about oh well they re printed up you know erm generically and so on pause dur short so i said well anyway it isn t there pause dur short so i left him and then found somebody else who told me it was on the first floor
1	okay so you and you believed this person
1	okay pause dur short i well i went to the first floor pause dur short i still had trouble finding it
1	mm
1	cos it wasn t terribly well labelled pause dur short but i found it in the end pause dur short so as i say you know probably nobody there because
1	wouldn t you have just trunc ha trunc if you d been walking around the first floor wouldn t you have just happened upon it
1	well the anon type place is enormous you know
1	well when you
1	yeah
1	said that you know aboutthe second floor i was trunc e trunc i was gonna say how big is this second floor
1	it s very very big and you you know we ve been there before there s you know it s big enough to trunc h trunc to house you know great big aeroplanes and tractors and you trunc s trunc you know spaceships almost you know so it s
1	trunc tr trunc er yeah okay
1	there s huge er installations in it pause dur short erm all you need is a few signs you know but they don t seem to do signs very well
1	yeah it s poor isn t it
1	anyway i didn t go straight there because erm i i i went on the three sixty and when i got off the bus i was outside the anon type place pause dur short and the other thing i wanted to see was an exhibition at the anon type place which was all about protests it s like art in protest it was called something like forbidden objects pause dur short so it featured placards and banners
1	oh right
1	and the tin pots do you remember when the argentinian protest they always took out pots and pans
1	yeah the noise they made coming down the street wow
1	mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah so there was there was you know a bit about that
1	we used them over here as well did we or not
1	no i don t think so i think they i think they ve been erm repeated elsewhere in the world but i don t think they ve been used in the uk
1	mm
1	so erm and there was quite a bit to read about that you know sort of trunc l trunc erm stuff you know mounted with explanations and things so that
1	mm yeah
1	wasn t a very explanation er trunc expi trunc exhibition but it was erm it was very interesting pause dur short and then i had a bit of a wander round the anon type place cos it s always there s always plenty to look at there you know so
1	is that like it s funny the museum i ve trunc b trunc been to them a few times i never really know which one i prefer or
1	yeah
1	or which you know
1	erm what was interesting was the queue to get in the anon type place was massive
1	oh was it
1	really big but trunc n trunc no queue to get in the anon type place
1	they people take their kids there more don t they
1	yeah but you d think people would take their kids to the anon type place more you know
1	yeah i thought it was unclear cos you have like things where in the anon type place where the kids can actually
1	yeah
1	there s things they can trunc ex trunc trunc i trunc things they can
1	interactive displays and yeah there s lots pause dur short trunc l trunc i would ve thought there s more for kids in the anon type place
1	displays yeah sure pause dur short yeah yeah that it was unclear unclear all the time unclear
1	but i suppose a lot of children like dinosaurs don t they and unclear that therefore
1	yeah it s got trunc s trunc yeah
1	erm anyway when i went into the anon type place there was an advert for the imax d cinema pause dur short and regular things going on you know so there was a erm something starting about twenty five minutes later about the universe pause dur short so i thought i ve never been to an imax cinema and i ve never seen an d film pause dur short so i ll get a ticket for that so unclear we should do unclear
1	where is that
1	it s actually in the anon type place
1	on in the trunc s trunc
1	yeah pause dur short yeah it s on the second floor pause dur short erm so pause dur short er it s quite a big erm auditorium and very well attended i mean not packed but
1	oh
1	you know lots of people doing the same thing pause dur short and you re given a pair of glasses pause dur short d glasses to put on pause dur short and there was a couple of adverts just a advert for a car or you know i was trunc b trunc dutifully wearing my d glasses thinking these don t make any difference at all pause dur short you know pause dur short kept on sort of peeping over the top of them pause dur short erm and obviously the adverts vocal desc laugh trunc w trunc obviously weren t d so i
1	i have some remembrance of doing this as trunc i trunc very young boy putting some glasses on
1	mm
1	to watch a certain
1	well when we were kids didn t we have those plastic glasses that would be one red trunc w trunc erm pane and one blue pane
1	type of thing pause dur short yeah probably that but it couldn t ve been d could it so
1	and that was meant to do something pause dur short but anyway erm pause dur short trunc u trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc when you do get the the d effect it is unbelievable
1	mm
1	i mean really it s it it it makes you jump the
1	is it
1	the an owl flew out of the screen pretty
1	mm mm
1	early on and you know and it s you know it really did feel very very close you know erm and erm pause dur short so it was a film about er ostrominers astronomers
1	mm
1	and they erm the serious astronomers all work in the desert in chile pause dur short because obviously you know if you you know if you want to look at the stars you need
1	yeah
1	a trunc zer trunc
1	sure
1	zero light pollution from you know
1	yeah
1	and erm so he said trunc u trunc trunc u trunc you know this this erm guy they featured erm who is also plays the piano so the we had you know followed him sort of arriving in chile and going to the desert and he s going to the top of a hill erm to work on the vlt pause dur short so ask ask me what means
1	it s something lettuce and tomato
1	no v not b
1	no no i know vocal desc laugh
1	oh vocal desc laugh and no it s not lettuce and tomato no
1	erm the vlt
1	yeah
1	er something er the visual land telescope
1	yeah well you got the telescope bit right the very large telescope vocal desc laugh
1	very large
1	and they ve got four vlts in this erm place and erm the pictures were fantastic trunc u trunc trunc u trunc the they said they are the actual pictures that you re seeing you know it s not it s not some sort of special effects mock up and which is a bit trunc di trunc because we ve seen so much on star wars and things like that that you know you weren t sure what you were seeing but you know the
1	pictures of what
1	erm galaxies and you know erm
1	oh right
1	erm the i it wasn t
1	it must be fantastic that sort of this mustn t it
1	yeah the i mean my only complaint really was that it wasn t very well explained
1	mm mm
1	it was like you know here s one where the star s exploded and it didn t really tell you
1	mm
1	why or how and you know the trunc u trunc the it was
1	does it matter it s only just
1	probably not i mean it was it was more visual impact than explaining
1	yeah
1	you know the science behind it but i trunc d trunc i didn t trunc r trunc half the time i didn t really know what i was looking at but it was very very erm impressive what they did pause dur short and then there was another erm bigger trunc telesc trunc a vvlt and vocal desc laugh they called this one erm alma i think this even bigger one erm
1	big alma
1	because they can t see erm vocal desc misc they can only trunc s trunc they can only penetrate light and so they have learnt from the mosquito who can detect things by erm heat pause dur short and movement and stuff like that so they they ve got this different approach with this other alma telescope it s not just light it s also movement and stuff so you it can penetrate er past the you know where the trunc nor trunc where the other super duper telescope can see this one can see even further
1	wasn t that the name of ray moore s wife big big alma
1	ray moore the radio unclear vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	yes and there was an alma on coronation street as well
1	he had a pause dur short yeah no but i in trunc f trunc er you you know unclear the entire programme unclear used to call him er he was always on about big alma pause dur short anyway er yeah sounds great
1	so i can thoroughly recommend erm a d experience
1	mm
1	erm trunc th trunc you you do sort of see a slight shadow i don t know whether it s cos my eyes are not very good but you know you can sort of trunc s trunc there s something a little bit fuzzy about the edges of erm figures and so on and i took when the credits went up and it was all writing i took my glasses off to see what that looked like without the glasses and it was all sort of like double you know you
1	there are d actual movies made now aren t there
1	oh yeah yeah
1	and do people sit with trunc gla trunc these glasses on do they
1	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah
1	as i say they tried this years and years forty years ago nearly
1	yeah but i don t think they had the trunc f trunc the the film technology right forty years ago like you know
1	yeah pause dur short no probably not
1	erm the the the the techniques would ve been very erm basic and crude pause dur short they ve got completely different filming techniques now for d
1	mm yeah no it was the way it was pretty underwhelming then quite frankly
1	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short no this is impressive you would you would be impressed with this
1	yeah
1	and also the imax experience as well is cos anon nametype n type name said that er filming for imax is a different technique as well so you could have an imax film presumably that wasn t d pause dur short but the screen s so big it s the height of it is er the height of four double decker buses
1	the height the screen is
1	the height of the screen yeah pause dur short yeah
1	was it
1	enormous yeah pause dur short so you get this very pause dur short you i mean you can t you know can see the edges just but you know it s it s a very overwhelming sort of experience you know you do feel as if z in it
1	so what room is is you know is it where is it actually
1	on the second floor of the anon type place
1	for but you d think it you say it s the height of all that
1	yeah
1	you know how come it s er are those trunc i trunc is it take up does it go beyond the second floor
1	well maybe it goes down you know
1	mm
1	it it might be like the edge of the building or something like the whole of the erm you know i dunno
1	yeah pause dur short mm mm
1	but it s very it s enormous
1	mm
1	but of course there is that one at near waterloo isn t there at the roundabout the the imax one
1	yeah well i thought that was an trunc ima trunc that yeah but but er
1	yeah it is yeah yeah pause dur short mm
1	i knew i d heard it somewhere
1	yeah pause dur short yeah so i don t know what the science of the filming but i know anon nametype n type name said it s very very expensive process to film for imax pause dur short so presumably as they were showing it off the we would ve had the combination of imax and d in this
1	mm
1	film
1	mm pause dur short sorry so when you went out did you actually know about this imax thing
1	no no i trunc tr trunc i mean i kind of did but i d forgotten really you know i i went out thinking i ll go to that people at work exhibition and then i thought oh while i m in the area i might as well go to the anon type place as well
1	mm
1	and erm you know trunc g trunc this other exhibition about forbidden objects you know cos they re both free so
1	yeah no sure pause dur short sure
1	i didn t need to book tickets to anything pause dur short so but i did it in all the wrong order so i when i got there i went first of all to the anon type place pause dur short and spent some time there and then when i went to the anon type place i went to this erm film pause dur short i had a cup of tea in the twenty minutes i had to wait and then after i came out of the imax cinema i went to find the people at work exhibition so the thing i d gone for i was beginning to think i m running the risk here of vocal desc laugh actually not seeing that you know erm and then when i came out i thought erm i might walk up to the anon type place and book a prom ticket for some time this week
1	okay
1	but i looked and i trunc di trunc i just didn t fancy walking i d been traipsing around a bit so i didn t really fancy walking up the and then trunc u trunc much to my annoyance a three sixty
1	unclear oh yeah unclear
1	and i trunc d trunc i could ve caught it cos you know
1	mm
1	and i couldn t wouldn t have been able to get across the road and down to the bus stop so i decided i was gonna race this three sixty to anon type place
1	on the tube
1	on the tube yeah so i thought if if the three sixty s got to sort of contend with traffic
1	mm
1	you know i thought i could probably beat it if i trunc c trunc caught the tube to anon type place and then just walked around the corner pause dur short anyway
1	but you were not right
1	mm pause dur short i was only just not right i think
1	you saw it in disappear into the distance
1	yeah when i came out of anon type place station it was just going round the corner
1	vocal desc misc pause dur short dear me
1	so pause dur short so i just walked from there
1	thought a bus good bus will always get a good tube will always beat a good bus
1	yeah but you trunc f trunc what you forget is how far you have to walk from
1	oh sure yeah i mean you were stood to get a a distance to walk to anon type place station yeah
1	the museums back to back to anon type place station pause dur short yeah pause dur short you go in that tunnel you know it goes on forever
1	i know it s bloody yeah long time i used to go in there years ago
1	yeah
1	oh we walked down there didn t we
1	yeah we did pause dur short yeah pause dur short uhu
1	cos you were on about some opera or something
1	yeah
1	oh pause dur short oh pause dur short a good afternoon was had by all
1	so it was yeah it was good yeah and erm i didn t i didn t get my proms ticket i
1	mm
1	didn t go in the anon type place but i didn t intend to do that
1	you can t do it all
1	can t do everything can you

0	worth drawing attention to the word curricula the plural of curriculum a warning against confusion with the adjective curricular as in extra curricular
0	it s so hard pause dur short feel sorry for people learning it
0	god even like we did it in the office and even people in the office were like i ve got no idea what some of these words mean or how to even pronounce them they were really simple trunc wor trunc like they looked quite simple but be like
0	they re just so hard
0	moosi mooses
0	well i suppose geese
0	uhu
0	why is the plural of moose not meese pause dur short want me to read it to you
0	vocal desc cough as fitting as it might sound the plural of moose is not and never has been meese
0	vocal desc laugh i love the way it s like it never has been so don t say it
0	why don t we do tell
0	simple the simple reason is that it s a loanword all nouns that are borrowed into the english language from their plural with this with the standard plural ending s retain the plural ending of the donor trunc lan trunc language eg phenomena algae the phenomenas algaes
0	after all geese is an obvious exception to the standard plural in english the reason goes back a millennium
0	and a half
0	there were geese in like a millennium and half ago
0	that went straight over over my head what does that mean
0	it is this is just like knows what i m gonna trunc sa trunc what i m gonna say
0	oh
0	and foot
0	feet
0	that s true
0	yeah
0	but then die is dice
0	isn t that a yes hang on
0	for more difficult plurals check out this place vocal desc laugh
0	whoever knows this must be off their head
0	it s in oxford dictionary though
0	okay
0	but then that means you could surely say pause dur short have some pizza yeah you say have some pizza no but that could be still plural or the singular i just bought
0	have a piece of
0	you would say i
0	i would only say i bought some pizza if i d bought one pizza
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm true pause dur short yeah i just bought lots of cake
0	mm anyway
0	mm weird
0	vocal desc laugh seriously this is what we do on a friday night vocal desc laugh it s just
0	vocal desc cough unfortunately the singular forms of some of these common english words now seem to be causing difficulty there s a recent trend to use the plural spelling women as a singular noun
0	no oh this mistake crops up in all types of writing i ve trunc n trunc i would never do that
0	a single women can have a child now vocal desc laugh
0	old norse eggs and italian pianos that s the next title vocal desc cough one of the main causes of plural puzzlement lies in the fact that english words is full of words that have been borrowed from other languages
0	mm
0	that s the singular i would imagine of a paparazzi
0	i think people use the word paparazzi now to mean the singular
0	i trunc lo trunc or unless there s like paparazzi
0	what s a virtuoso
0	trunc chat trunc
0	it does pause dur short er as before vocal desc laugh the best way to ensure you re correct is to check a good dictionary
0	you don t have to buy us but we really think you should uhu uhu
0	vocal desc laugh pause dur long it s just such a peculiar language
0	so there s one plural one singular but then you have with sweeteners
0	yeah sugars yeah pause dur short which implies different types of sugars
0	mm
0	so that wouldn t say with two sweeteners
0	vocal desc laugh
0	well yeah just with the unclear one sugar and then trunc swee trunc it s like they use two sweeteners
0	mm
0	and i think in one country i was reading in england there was like ten teaspoons of sugar in
0	mm
0	something else pause dur short but she said pause dur short sure it was something to do the with that they re beginning to import pause dur long sort of westernised foods and things
0	yeah i can imagine yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah yeah it must be so different for them like us going to china and stuff it or like going abroad it even just going abroad to like i d never went to barcelona and stuff it still like it still makes your tummy go a bit weird
0	mm
0	yeah
0	weird isn t it
0	mm pause dur short but then i guess their food probably isn t as like pause dur short not not trunc st trunc that s not what i mean but you know like processed as ours maybe
0	well pause dur short all i know is that i don t think i eat too badly sometimes i do don t get me wrong i m definitely not saying that i have a good diet but pause dur short i think vocal desc yawn i have a better diet than a lot of people
0	like there are some days obviously where i eat cake and shit like that but pause dur short if i do i don t eat like a lot of it
0	mm
0	yeah
0	mine s just shit my metabolism it s so like slow
0	so is mine
0	all things considered
0	dust it i suppose
0	vocal desc misc excuse me
0	it s just this room it just looks messy but it s just because it s just such a dreary colour like the white is like this dodgy off white the floor genuinely looks
0	vocal desc laugh we were just
0	so boring
0	that was it
0	oh no we looked round did you look round on your own
0	oh yeah i did yeah
0	and it was really small
0	it was really small
0	so what s the point of looking at any more i can t
0	exactly
0	exactly
0	vocal desc laugh
0	that should be easy though surely for you because
0	mm yeah
0	so and it s only gonna be for like january to june or something january
0	i know i i m already thinking about the next payday
0	i say that vocal desc laugh every month

0	all i ve got to do is go to like maybe anon type place for a weekend or anon type place to go the christmas market it s like i never spend money at the christmas market because it s just full of crap the only stuff i buy is food
0	so hopefully december and especially if we don t have to pay rent here
0	hopefully december i should be able to save like a good five hundred six hundred pounds maybe
0	hopefully you ll be able to maybe ring up the electric people on if unclear
0	yeah pause dur short uhu
0	cos he was he was calculating it from yesterday so
0	really handy
0	et voila foreign
0	that s all they need to know and then like at the bottom i think i just said like it comes to something like five hundred quid a month
0	vocal desc laugh what s wrong with that
0	vocal desc laugh it s an information pack
0	well we were pretty trunc un trunc like unaware weren t we
0	mm pause dur long yeah when she was oh it s like how much do you pay in council tax like obviously i think she must have been paying something different to us because
0	it s like

0	vocal desc cough i prefer that bed to the one that s in the spare room at home

0	oh great
0	that i ve given you yeah
0	why
0	have they kept on thingy anon nametype n type name then
0	that s what she knows

0	i don t know i don t know what she s trunc do trunc she ll have to she can t sit at home for the next forty years can she
0	like well maybe not forty years
0	she ll waste her years away
0	yeah
0	no
0	she s more like a cooker than a baker i think she should just get like a trunc part trunc i thing is though i said to her why don t you have a look at cie so cie is basically like an international version of ocr or aqa right and it s who we work really closely with and like they have exam things all the time like why can t she just go and work for an exam board
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	why not mm
0	we re off what s happening anon type place mm er i think dad would like to live in anon type place anon type place is a nice place but i don t think that s in his ideas at the moment
0	oh that s really really bad
0	and obviously because they don t have a mortgage or anything they have
0	yeah that that helps
0	no vocal desc laugh don t ask such stupid questions anon nametype f type name vocal desc laugh i think the kitchen still needs to be painted the bathroom tiles still need to be done and that s about it i think so it s nearly
0	mum did ring i rang i spoke to mum
0	oh yeah i must have done
0	yeah
0	yeah cos you must seen me trunc m trunc
0	yeah vocal desc laugh we had banners vocal desc laugh

0	i haven t been to yours since we ve been here
0	let s just go to your house for the day vocal desc laugh
0	yeah no so i think she s gonna be jobless
0	oh well she ll find something else it s just you need the looking for another job is effort and she needs the motivation and the kick up the arse to do it pause dur short exactly mum and
0	no thirtieth of december i think pause dur short oh no
0	that s even
0	yeah it s christmas and now you re jobless woohoo
0	we ll see you
0	but it s a really bad time i think but also i feel so really sorry for anon nametype m type name because anon nametype m type name s just got a mortgage and everything
0	he just bought a house with his girlfriend
0	yeah
0	yeah he was like i think he was really quite well paid like he d worked his way up he was like head of upper sixth or something pause dur short yeah
0	unclear he wasn t even teacher was he
0	no pause dur short yeah
0	yeah
0	just over a grand a month for a year
0	no
0	seriously that s what i think that they think pause dur short the amount of trunc s trunc like the stuff that like pause dur short stupid because they end up giving people these pensions i suppose state pensions
0	and the people like anon nametype m type name who doesn t spend anything can just hoards money like
0	really trunc ye trunc vocal desc laugh
0	every time i speak to dad it s just like just keeps getting bigger and just like well that s great isn t it vocal desc laugh
0	i d like to be able to forget about fifteen grand
0	i know vocal desc laugh oh yeah just chilling in a bank somewhere it s like yeah chilling for a fucking long time grandma vocal desc laugh pause dur short and then i think my dad put loads of her money into you know recently the government bonds they had like really good interest rates for government bonds but you had to leave them in there for four years or something like that so i think he whacked a load of her money into those and he said to my auntie beforehand he was like do you need any of anon nametype f type name s money to buy a house because trunc sh trunc trunc m trunc anon nametype f type name wanted to move pause dur short and she was like no no no we re fine we re fine we re fine so he put all of this into erm a government savings bond which you can t take out unless you have to pay a penalty and then she came to dad and was like oh yeah i need ten thousand pounds and dad was like well tough you can t trunc ha trunc like
0	too late vocal desc laugh
0	surely she wouldn t have believed that
0	dad was like no i didn t go away vocal desc laugh stupid sister
0	yeah it s no good being a kept woman if you re sitting at home all day doing fuck all is there like
0	well i can t
0	cos if you you know like people their kids they go to private school private school costs like thirty five thousand pounds a year that means your husband or your wife has to earn or has to earn enough to have a disposable income of thirty five thousand pounds a year
0	a lot of money
0	a hundred and fifty thousand more like plus
0	my kids are not going to private school full stop not doing it
0	you can go to state school and suck it up
0	yeah we came out fine we got good grades
0	and have dogs in bags
0	vocal desc laugh got a ford fiesta
0	vocal desc laugh
0	a volkswagen up thank you very much
0	yeah don t wanna be judged on our money wanna be judged on our personalities vocal desc laugh
0	or no cars
0	exactly i like my little car does me well what time is it
0	oh
0	yeah
0	cos i will use the hoover after you
0	yeah okay
0	that s the idea i think
0	oh i was in bed the other day and i just like heard this rustling i was like oh no what is that so like i was like okay what the hell and there was like a spider in a plastic and just stamped the bag i was like
0	oh it s
0	vocal desc laugh did you see that massive spider the door on the box of pause dur short it er er carwash kit by the door
0	good
0	i know those ones over there would be really helpful
0	unclear to be fair we ve unclear got enough lightbulbs in there to
0	true
0	both yours oh they re all both hers
0	was it in my cupboard it was in my cupboard i think
0	trunc ye trunc she used the bookshelf i think and obviously that was there
0	and we were gonna erm paint it and then you got it out and kind of said that it looked okay without being painted so we didn t do it
0	i know they re preventative but still they it s such an effort although i did like going to see the hygienist actually despite the fact that it hurt my teeth were clean afterwards pause dur short and i think one of my wisdom teeth is coming through but it doesn t hurt i can just feel it
0	that s good
0	i ve just got like a bit of a hard lump at the back of my mouth like a bit of a hole or trunc someth trunc
0	vocal desc laugh come out the roof of my mouth
0	vocal desc laugh i don t i i can t feel any at the back coming through on the bottom shelf pause dur short tongues are really weird things aren t they just fondling my own mouth
0	yeah
0	it s a really peculiar part of the body vocal desc laugh
0	don t know pause dur short i think i must have liked i don t know
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and i had to like vocal desc misc right now it doesn t hurt but i think there might be a little bit of bruising but
0	the sooner we get it done
0	i think pause dur short oh no i guess there s some jobs in the house that like sort of i don t know like there s jobs you prefer to do and like there s thing i quite like doing you know you say you don t like doing the bins
0	i don t mind doing that i don t know why but understand why you wouldn t enjoy doing that not enjoy
0	i don t like it it s always just a faff and the bag rips and whatever and it stinks and take it outside
0	that s why you invest in decent bin bags and then
0	i know i thought they were the same ones as we bought last time but they re obviously not cos they re crap
0	yeah
0	it s not there s no one job i don t like doing for me it s more a case of like i hate i hate not feeling like i ve got the energy to do things cos i like doing them i like getting things done i like tidying and i like cleaning and i like everything being nice you know
0	awful at the moment vocal desc laugh yeah what about you
0	that s not a job
0	no one minds that
0	that s what i hate
0	that squid off
0	those two that i ve left to soak but i ve done your dad s trick of leaving them upside down and i ll do them before work tomorrow
0	it s gotta go down eventually
0	drank erm and yeah and he s like i thought he was really annoyed at me and he s like here you are soak the sink get a bit of soap around the inside of it soften it up next day it was like it d been in the dishwasher it was amazing
0	this is crazy have i seen what this this rachel riley advert did you know it s illegal to for celebrities to say things that are scientifically untrue i m not sure whether it s just to do with health i think teeth might be okay cos she she s saying like toothpaste as if it like it s becoming sentient like hello anon nametype f type name i ve noticed cavities in your mouth and when you see that advert
0	they meant to like improve your
0	there just like the world s most comfy shoes apparently but they look hideous
0	it s not to do with like cosmetics cos on cosmetics adverts you see fake eyelashes and stuff
0	yeah but no i don t like like i think i think when you re living with someone should divide i think you have to divide labour normally it just works out but if one person is doing everything and one person s doing nothing i think that s quite bad
0	yeah and i don t mind and i think we kind of do it in quite a nice way when one of us is having a particularly crappy week the other one will step up and do a bit more and i sort of like that rather than this is your job you always do this it s like we both do everything and sometimes we do a little bit more or less depending on our feeling
0	that s a good idea
0	bit of a weird one isn t it cos
0	vocal desc laugh did you watch this with me the other day
0	i think i think this was on tv last night are you unclear onto unclear the burger king adverts with richard blackwood
0	do you remember who richard blackwood was
0	unclear
0	vocal desc laugh
0	millennia and then erm and then we had
0	and then he did and then he did some tv show and i think it i think it s what happens sometimes is like when you re in tv it s like say you re on huh say you say take like jon richardson for example who has probably gained a lot of popularity from this show
0	yeah
0	then he ll probably get offers to do like you know a trunc ch trunc like his own talk show or something like that eventually but
0	yeah
0	and now he just hosts rude tube
0	which is quite bad
0	i know it s horrible
0	yeah people who don t smoke can always like smell it a mile off
0	are they alright should you be able to smoke indoors with them should you have to go outside with them are they safe
0	yeah
0	they re like vocal desc laugh
0	the same trunc prin trunc
0	really
0	trunc e trunc the i don t get i don t i dunno
0	and it s like rodney rodney rodney wake up you dipstick
0	yeah it was cool though
0	how much did you sell it for
0	you re joking they were like thirty quid then i remember them being in the
0	i sold it it s come back
0	oh
0	erm and he just said try to be a bit less english about things don t think that you owe just by virtue of being in a shop you owe them a sale and things like that
0	then you know i think we re such a wasteful culture as well that we sort of become burdened by the things we buy like property and all our crap and people know you want to get rid of it so people low ball you don t you
0	i think you if you just hung on a bit longer
0	they literally throw money in the bin
0	that s what they use it
0	not my interest at all
0	yeah that s event desc sound of tv pause dur short
0	do you think he just retried off the profits from this
0	like everything
0	oh is it etsy
0	no no cos etsy is what other people have made
0	could be whole number of things
0	i can never remember what it s called it s something or in something or but i asked i
0	bunting and cakes
0	instructables that makes more sense she just put fair well anon nametype f type name and then she had put nice kn owing you
0	yeah
0	that s really a nice idea
0	so i m anon nametype f type name just been like there s loads of tree stumps
0	is that more than what you get now
0	i mean do you make that many phone calls now
0	i do have other friends
0	i don t like texted people so i always ring them
0	alright you don t have to shop for me it s what my mum would do anon nametype m type name are you possibly looking to buy something soon cos i can go on the internet and research it for you
0	hundred pound
0	yeah ninety pound phone charger this is as far as i can see is just haven for thieves
0	why
0	yeah
0	bought a phone without a charger
0	my old samsung i just received it it did come in a box though which is good
0	oh yeah
0	cos i just wanted the same phone i didn t want like i liked that phone
0	just don t like change
0	that s the best thing
0	the size of your head
0	yeah but he must set that up surely
0	hello anon nametype m type name have you
0	poignant
0	scarlett johansson
0	that s why you want to see it
0	sexy voice
0	she s not actually in it at any point it s just joaquin phoenix but erm yeah it s dead weird what was it telling him to do the other day
0	have you eaten your five a day
0	i mean okay i ve dropped it and smashed the screen but other than that i mean that s a decent bit of kit really they re just quality products i guess
0	yeah more likely it is for someone to nick it
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah familiarity
0	but you just don t think that like you know you were saying that one in asda
0	yeah i mean you wander around in a world of your own in asda and you can see exactly what had happened like they d probably left their handbag on the side of the trolley and just nipped off slightly away from their trolley to just grab something
0	and he s just stuck his hand in and just pinched
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	it s so weird
0	nasty
0	oh is she good how s she finding it
0	she was aching but that s only a good thing isn t it
0	i m really tough with give it up immediately never go back but i think she knows how important it is
0	yeah
0	feel like they ve made loads of lifestyle changes since you ve moved out i sort of think
0	no no no you can nag at people can t you and like tell them to do more of this don t eat that and stuff and it comes from a really good place and you don t mean it to sound naggy but then when you re not there any it s almost like you re not going to do that cos they re telling me to do it all the time
0	your own advice
0	but even like frozen food that takes a bit longer they re not interested in and i was just sort saying about you and how good you are at you know just making the best of what you ve got
0	that s from my nan
0	lobby she used to like you know when you just have a few peas at the bottom of buying frozen peas or frozen veg
0	i don t know out of frozen veg i don t know but she did but she d like never ever waste anything
0	erm she seems okay actually anon nametype m type name took her out in the wheelchair today
0	yeah you know auntie anon nametype f type name
0	she s got three children anon nametype m type name anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name
0	and then anon nametype f type name is the youngest who had the baby at sixteen
0	right
0	but does it effect you in any other way
0	i notice it more and more in my students but then it s obviously like it s i ve started to like i had a dyslexic i think had a dyslexic student a while ago but it s not my place you know
0	no
0	but if you re spanish and you re struggling and you getting your bs and ds mixed up there s no reason for that in terms of broad language
0	cos they have bs and ds in spanish so
0	but our printed the way we pronounce words is so different to spanish and italian the way words are written in spanish is how they sound
0	yeah
0	no
0	and mixed up
0	but printing on different colour paper
0	well
0	helps sort of like pink or blue or green
0	like dyslexics friendly
0	yeah acetate
0	suppose shouldn t take it for granted should you
0	definitely so it amazes me how specific some difficulties can be like specific parts of your brain that do really specific things
0	yeah
0	and then like weird little things we can have er deficit in naming something but you know what it is you just can t name it you can t see moving pictures or
0	but you re really good at writing though
0	don t really enjoy it i can write like a scientific report cos it s scientific and it s fact i don t like if you ask me to sit down and write a story it would be the most amateurish thing you ve seen any kind of like creative writing
0	rubbish cos people see my name against it
0	and a lot of like publications it s that thing between quality and content and sometimes the content s great it doesn t really matter how it s written hence the tabloid press like they get obviously i mean it doesn t mean how it comes out if there s a juicy bit of fact or juicy bit of controversial information then you know often it just gets put out regardless of you know the writing but then sometimes you just feel it now cos i read so much more than i used to and i read a lot of different stuff i can really i m not like you know i m not very critical of it but i know when i ve read something that i don t think is put together very well or i think it s really weirdly written like that you do become better at it
0	yeah your mental arithmetic is better than mine
0	i don t know did you see that thing who was like a six year old maths genius how do you why is it you enjoy maths and he s like cos it just makes sense
0	it s like i just don t understand maths on that level
0	is that where all the assistants meet
0	all the assistants
0	sounds terrible
0	like they ve got their head really far up someone s bum so brown neck
0	ah i ve never heard that
0	really
0	she s she s
0	narky and like they don t want me so i m not going to go so i like please go please go it ll be more fun if you come and i was like you ve got nothing else to do so come she was like yeah true i ll come erm and the i was like to make it more interesting he said she was going to write down all the things that all the cringe worthy things that other assistants say so then i suggested that we make assistant bingo and write down a load of phrases that people are gonna say and the person who ticks off the most wins
0	it a nice walk i mean today was lovely walk
0	i think if i started sitting down in my job i think i should join a gym
0	but it s how you feel not how you look i feel like heavy like heavy not heavy but i feel like slow in my movements

1	well that s already six hundred quid seven hundred quid

1	would you also have an island like in those
1	no
1	lifestyle magazines

1	it s like a blueberry
1	trunc crumbl trunc
1	pie or
1	yes it is
1	something like that

1	of course yes it s looking very crumbly pause dur short excellent
1	and it s not gonna be easy i m afraid so
1	oh thank you very much
1	so erm
1	that s excellent where did you get this from
1	well i was down in anon type place yesterday
1	oh yeah
1	and er there was a a launch of a one point four million pound anon type miscpersonalinfo
1	mm
1	project which i m vaguely attached to and there was lots of things vocal desc laugh on offer and of course i nabbed this one cos i could for the train journey back
1	yeah pause dur short cos when you sent me the email about the recordings
1	mm
1	before i read it i just saw the title
1	yeah
1	and i thought i wonder if he wants the recordings i did of all those police officers years ago
1	now they would
1	or
1	not be in the public domain
1	or whether you were interested in recordings i d made of films about the police something like that
1	yeah
1	i i had not a clue that you meant pause dur short what was in the body of the email pause dur short very nice
1	it is nice isn t it
1	mm
1	goes well
1	we trunc sh trunc
1	with coffee
1	mm it does so was this anon type place trunc yo trunc anon type place thing worth the the trip
1	oh it s difficult to tell it was good
1	yeah
1	to see them you trunc kn trunc you know in the flesh
1	yeah
1	and i m i usually admiring of somebody who can get that big a project going for anon type place as we know it s
1	yeah
1	it s just
1	yeah
1	horrendously difficult but there s five strands to this project and it s pretty obvious to everybody that they re all very different they do different things pause dur short and they may or may not cohere together but you know each strand will probably
1	mm
1	be good enough in its own right to produce stuff and that s what the anon type place want
1	well you see a few years ago i was involved a project like this
1	ah
1	which was supposed to be about good governance and the criminal justice system and it was coordinated by a chap from er london who was also a fellow at anon type place in anon type place and erm trunc i trunc i m not saying that there weren t some valuable pieces done with each individual study but the whole thing fell apart as a farce because one of the studies was railway timetables in the victorian era whereas
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i was doing one on on crime figures
1	did trunc yo trunc
1	you know
1	it it it surely there must be you re teasing me no it was really that
1	no i am not teasing you pause dur short so trunc w trunc we actually had meetings where this
1	vocal desc laugh
1	this this you know erm anon type place stroke anon type place guy was desperately trying to get us to go away and come back with some all encompassing
1	all encompassing vocal desc laugh
1	erm brand really and it was
1	yeah
1	impossible
1	right
1	it was it was impossible it wasn t just that some were geographers and some were economists and all that sort of thing it was just it was chalk cheese
1	yeah
1	apples pears
1	apple pears vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	well the the funding body must have gone in with its eyes open i mean they would have pause dur short if they didn t like that element of it you know that that obviously
1	mm
1	out with the the general pattern the social science element they d have said cut this bit or we won t give you the money
1	mm
1	the other thing is you
1	instead trunc o trunc sorry
1	you they mutate don t they once you get the money people do slightly different things
1	yeah
1	you know
1	is there anything likely to be in for a discourse
1	that s what i m hoping for the
1	mm
1	one of them the strands was about pause dur short the kind of thing i ve been doing
1	yeah
1	on intellectual stability
1	well that would be very good wouldn t it
1	it would
1	and very prestigious
1	mm
1	well i wish you luck with that excellent er
1	well it was good
1	muffin
1	it s worth knowing that
1	excellent yeah it does go very well with the coffee too
1	vocal desc laugh
1	rather italian that
1	but you can t dunk it
1	well no i m not a dunker of er if i did it would be in tea with a
1	vocal desc laugh
1	biscuit
1	it would have to be a biscuit in tea it couldn t be something like this in tea
1	no i mean my
1	cos it would just fall apart
1	friend my trunc itali trunc that s why they have those huge coffee cups in the morning
1	ah yes
1	i have italian friends who have a
1	yes
1	huge
1	yes yes
1	coffee cup
1	yes
1	looks more like
1	yes
1	soup
1	yes
1	bowl
1	yes yes
1	and there they are with their
1	yeah
1	croissant
1	yeah that makes sense as long as the croissant is not the savoury kind obviously
1	i oh well i i m not er i m not a dunker of croissants or pause dur short i m not with them on that score and the cup is so big it s
1	yeah yeah
1	far too much effort
1	vocal desc laugh
1	for me in the morning pause dur short erm some of them look like you could have a swim in them you know
1	that s right to go to the other extreme i was in a
1	mm
1	a place in anon type place the other day which i thought you d get a decent cup of coffee here it was
1	yeah
1	anon type place it s er kind of an arty place
1	oh yeah yeah yeah
1	so i thought i ll just ask a young lady and er can you trunc e trunc espresso she said oh yes no problem er okay well i think actually i think i ll have a macchiato pause dur short blank look
1	completely blank face was it
1	completely blank look but obviously you know keen to help er i i m certainly i m sure we can do that just remind me what it is again i said well i i but i chose my words not very carefully i said
1	uhu
1	well it s basically an espressowith a drop of milk in it
1	uhu
1	ah now that
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	is trunc i trunc that s true up to a point vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh yeah it is up to point yes
1	up to a point
1	yeah
1	and what do you think i got
1	a milky lukewarm coffee vocal desc laugh
1	espresso
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh with milk in it and
1	yeah and stirred in
1	vocal desc laugh and stirred in
1	yes exactly yeah
1	yes that s right
1	mm not quite what you had in mind
1	no er but then i unclear funked unclear it when she said er i mean trunc sh trunc unclear read unclear it and gave it to me and i looked at it and trunc sai trunc basically it s beige liquid you know
1	yeah
1	and it filled the cup and she said is it alright i should have you know done some an education on it some education on it and she said is that alright cos i really want to learn and i said pause dur short yes it s fine
1	mm oh well that was that was nice of you pause dur short er that was nice of you
1	vocal desc laugh but that means that
1	yeah
1	you know
1	trunc yo trunc you you you
1	every that s vocal desc laugh
1	that s what you ll get every time
1	every time
1	unless you go in and say trunc yo trunc you know what actually i misled you there
1	mm
1	er and macchiato is like a mini cappuccino
1	yeah yeah right exactly
1	you know
1	vocal desc laugh of course that may lead into all other kinds of areas
1	er or that that assumes she knows what a cappuccino is
1	trunc ye trunc yeah
1	acqua sporca foreign which is what you just had dirty water
1	acqua sporca foreign
1	which is which is their slang word for an american coffee pause dur short though they don t say that
1	okay no no that s right
1	to the americans who order it
1	that s right
1	yeah
1	if you ask for an americano you just get a
1	you get the equivalent of
1	a very liquid a very diluted
1	a long sort of coffee drink
1	yeah
1	and they they pour milk into it
1	and that s
1	you know that s
1	held in some contempt is it
1	acqua sporca foreign dirty water
1	acqua sporca foreign you d ask for an americano
1	well er no i mean as a joke
1	right yeah
1	you know i mean
1	okay
1	i think it s well understood that this is what the tourists
1	right
1	not not necessarily the americans
1	no no that s right
1	but this what tourists want
1	that s right yes
1	but but an but an americano is is on the menu in a bar
1	it s on the menu
1	trunc f trunc for tourists
1	that s right
1	it would be like i can t i trunc c trunc i can t believe that many italians would drink an americano pause dur short cos it
1	vocal desc misc vocal desc sigh
1	it is a bit like erm you know you you may as well get erm instant coffee pour boiling water on it
1	yes
1	and pour the milk in
1	yeah i mean
1	cos that that s that s
1	that s right that s right
1	trunc e trunc essentially all it is
1	i i can t remember in whether in spain there s an equivalent of an americano as such
1	oh right i don t know i don t know enough about spain
1	i i think you d have to ask for pause dur long
1	well
1	i don t even know they d have one
1	trunc wha trunc what i ve heard in in some places on the continent is british people saying can i just have an ordinary coffee
1	vocal desc laugh yes that s right
1	heard that
1	an ordinary coffee vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh and they re not unclear shouting unclear it
1	no no no no
1	you know and it s a trunc perf trunc
1	can i just have an ordinary coffee vocal desc laugh
1	i i know i know exactly what they mean
1	vocal desc laugh that s right
1	you know just an ordinary coffee you know
1	that s right exactly
1	but vocal desc laugh but it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	may not be known on the continent what an ordinary coffee is vocal desc laugh
1	exactly i mean their trunc s trunc notion of ordinary
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know surely is as respectable a notion as our
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but okay yeah
1	i think that s a classic just an ordinary one
1	i think what you should have is an italian go into a bar in britain and say can i just have an ordinary coffee and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and pause dur short show amazement at being given in fact an ordinary coffee
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh god well er i mean vocal desc laugh i suppose you you you learn from your travels don t you
1	well coffee trunc ha trunc we ve said this to each other before coffee has got better
1	oh yeah definitely i mean i agree with you entirely erm and i mean if you go into some of the big chains er it s ridiculous some of the variations that they offer and then
1	yeah
1	they they don t want to use terms like small medium and large do they
1	no no they re in it
1	i don t know what they are is it tall or
1	that is ludicrous
1	whatever it is
1	that s right
1	yeah
1	grande foreign
1	yeah you know yeah
1	superbo foreign vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh yes exactly
1	and i think that s vocal desc laugh for god s sake yeah that s right
1	it s all seems a bit pretentious to me
1	that s right i bet the
1	which again you don t see say
1	no
1	in italy or i imagine you wouldn t see it in er
1	well that s another question
1	spain
1	do they offer you different sizes
1	doppio foreign
1	yeah
1	but that s just two of them
1	sure
1	you have to ask for that
1	right
1	i don t think you often see it written up on
1	no that there are different
1	on the wall
1	sizes to be had
1	no
1	that s a very anglo american type of thing isn t it
1	uhu
1	i mean
1	and you don t see too many coffees to go either because the er the assumption is that if you are in a hurry you you will have it in a nice bit of cutlery but at the bar and you ll knock it down and say thank you very much pay your bill and out and out you walk
1	well yeah that s right that s right that s right
1	yeah
1	but here routinely pause dur short you re asked if it s for an espresso is that single or double sir
1	yes or or to go or drink in or trunc exac trunc do you want anything with that or
1	that s right always yes
1	but i think coffee drinking here is something when you look at some coffee shops i mean that have opened up in bookstores or
1	yeah yeah
1	there there is material to read
1	well yeah
1	and you talk about wi fi
1	yeah oh yeah
1	and all have their coffees with it
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	coffee in britain is more than it is for a lot of italians i m not saying italians don t go into a bar
1	mm
1	or or or a trunc k trunc kind of a mini place and and linger pause dur short but equally you see a lot of people go in the espressois knocked back
1	yeah that s right
1	and they go
1	that s right even if they re unclear group of them unclear
1	yes
1	they ll they ll order together or
1	mm
1	one of unclear of us unclear will order
1	mm
1	they ll stand at the bar
1	yeah
1	they ll drink it and then they go off again
1	and you ve got very experienced baristas
1	yes
1	who can knock these things out very quickly
1	that s right that s right that s right
1	they re not fiddling with the dials or
1	that s right
1	or anything like that
1	that s right that s right
1	they know where everything is
1	that s right
1	they ve got er they ve got two what i don t know
1	that s right
1	nozzles is that s not the word for it
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	but then they ve got two or more nozzles working and they knock these things out
1	true true
1	quite quickly
1	that s what you could have in your new kitchen if you go down that
1	oh
1	a gaggia machine taking up the entire half of the wall
1	yeah you mean add about four thousand pounds to the cost of my kitchen
1	trunc ye trunc er but think of the prestige you know
1	mm and think of how many people would be knocking at my door
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i just happened to be passing
1	that s it passing by vocal desc laugh
1	but it s a cul de sac for god s sake
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh really vocal desc misc can i smell the coffee
1	oh do i smell coffee in the air yeah
1	it s a shame
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you retired anon nametype m type name but still we know you re in most days
1	vocal desc laugh yes that s right well you could just hang up a little sign outside
1	yeah you could really
1	saying you know
1	yes but i m i i think some of them would be cheeky enough to be saying but i thought you d like it if you bought the students round for a seminar
1	vocal desc laugh yes that s
1	in your living room
1	vocal desc laugh yes in your room i ve brought
1	you know
1	my own cups
1	vocal desc laugh yes exactly
1	it s like you know no washing up that s
1	keep your hand in anon nametype m type name you don t wanna completely retire
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	yes
1	but it apparently it turns out those things cos you can get them for the house
1	yeah
1	for you know
1	i know
1	for domestic are just appallingly temperamental
1	are they
1	and difficult apparently that s right
1	oh right
1	trunc becau trunc er they rely on
1	well i m glad you ve put me off
1	i vocal desc laugh
1	cos i was just rushing out to get one well
1	cos you ve got the water pressure issue apparently trunc apparent trunc i don t know it s what they say but
1	oh really well the water pressure s not brilliant where i live pause dur short they changed the water supply recently and they send me a note not a note they sent me a formal letter
1	mm
1	telling me of the official change of some reservoir to a new reservoir
1	oh right vocal desc laugh
1	and telling me that er no assuring me
1	trunc abso trunc
1	that the water was still good to drink and there shouldn t be any change in
1	vocal desc laugh
1	taste pause dur short but that i
1	well they
1	might find it quote
1	vocal desc laugh
1	a little harder
1	oh right this is cos
1	which is not good news for your your
1	yeah that
1	washing machine
1	that s right machine
1	or dishwasher and so on
1	anon type place
1	if it s getting much harder
1	is well known to be
1	a hard area
1	you know a centre of water aficionados and cognoscenti cos they
1	right
1	turn on the tap and they say mm this is not the same reservoir
1	no
1	it s it s
1	and it s not yes and it s not from the north side i can tell by the
1	no it s the
1	temperature vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh south side exactly
1	this is the south side it s a
1	it s it gets a lot more sun
1	it s a might too hot
1	that s right
1	vocal desc laugh yes i d describe this tepid er well let the tap run for a little bit longer then vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh yes
1	well it s very good of them but i haven t had any such communication
1	well you obviously they haven t changed your supplier well it s not it s not it s still anon type place water
1	right
1	but they are
1	right
1	you re
1	right right
1	getting it from your your bog standard reservoir
1	that s right
1	you ve always got it from
1	vocal desc laugh probably get it from the the anon type place
1	but you see people in anon type place
1	vocal desc laugh
1	are more discerning so they have to
1	vocal desc laugh
1	change the reservoir where we get ours from vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	there s there s been there s been blind tasting of the water
1	yes i think probably just the the incidents of dead dogs er in your old reservoirs has reached the
1	adds a certain
1	vocal desc laugh
1	dare one say body
1	piquancy
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh body
1	yeah
1	that s right yeah vocal desc laugh
1	yeah well there we are
1	i shall look out for that i i shall see what er
1	well if i were you
1	they have to say
1	i would be writing letters of complaint to anon type place
1	saying that
1	saying
1	well why have i got
1	why aren t i getting a new reservoir
1	the old reservoir that s right vocal desc laugh i had a guy
1	mm
1	come round doing trunc ba trunc the bathroom thing er and he was
1	yeah
1	looking round the bathroom and he you know he was perfectly you know sensible and he said to me first question er do you have high pressurised water and i thought oh god i i don t i have absolutely no idea
1	well i no i wouldn t know what what the definition of that was pause dur short i mean it s gonna be it s either gonna cut the mustard or it s gonna
1	well it s just
1	you know i mean there is it s it s either highish or lowish or something but there there s no
1	mm
1	it s just like saying trunc ha trunc have you got gas central heating no i haven t you ve either got that or you haven t got it
1	or you haven t
1	but
1	that s right
1	pressure is a matter of degree when does it become high pressure
1	well maybe it also er trunc b trunc it s one of those things that you just say you know
1	oh right
1	when you re
1	well what difference
1	trunc en trunc enquiring
1	would it make
1	well i suppose the i can t imagine
1	three thousand pounds
1	anyway
1	as to
1	er it
1	what he was gonna put in
1	vocal desc laugh trunc exac trunc just trunc tha trunc i said
1	mm
1	well the tank s around here and he went and looked at the tank he said
1	mm
1	oh yes yes you ve got high pressure
1	mm
1	of course this could be an entirely made up question with a made up answer just to you know wrong foot the client
1	vocal desc laugh well i can just imagine someone saying erm do do you want an engine in this unclear car unclear you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh let me just check oh it s got an engine
1	that s right
1	yeah
1	but but
1	yeah
1	you can imagine it being semi veridical like you know
1	well yeah
1	er if the electrician asks you er are you on ac or dc here
1	trunc y trunc well i d know that was a kosher question
1	okay okay you d know that
1	yeah yeah
1	was a kosher question
1	yeah actually i think if somebody asks me that i d think well hang on if i m not high pressure what s that gonna mean
1	yes
1	and i might be worried then if he said
1	that s right
1	oh well
1	oh well
1	you can t have this that and the other
1	that s right vocal desc laugh that s that s it
1	you ll have to have a bog standard shower
1	yeah vocal desc laugh that s right
1	rather than one that comes at you from
1	vocal desc laugh that s all sides
1	twenty two different angles and
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	you know and
1	yes
1	and a bidet will be no good at all
1	oh yes exactly
1	unless you ve got high pressure you know
1	vocal desc laugh you got i got that s right
1	cos water has to go up that way
1	that s right
1	you know
1	but it
1	yeah
1	would probably be the other way round wouldn t it so ah well if you haven t got this it ll cost you a lot more
1	ah well
1	we or if
1	that s what i mean
1	you have got x it ll trunc co trunc vocal desc laugh so whichever
1	then we have to tone it down
1	way you answer vocal desc laugh that s right yeah
1	we have to tone it down or it ll kill you vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh that s right yeah
1	you go in that shower you ll be dead vocal desc laugh
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well i shall see how that plan pans out
1	well you must let know how this works out
1	i well
1	cos i ve never known before i i ve been asked about hard and soft water
1	ah okay right
1	but
1	right
1	i ve never been asked or heard about high or low water
1	pressurised water
1	well no i don t know i i d
1	it it i i may be
1	mm
1	doing him a disservice here he may have said do you have a pressurising pressurising
1	oh
1	boiler pause dur short does that
1	ah there is
1	make any more sense
1	there is such a thing as that yes erm that that s where i think it might be something to do with where you turn the pause dur short tap on the hot water top the boiler comes on instantly and heats the water
1	no it s not
1	he didn t mean that
1	no it didn t mean that
1	oh right okay well i give in
1	but that could only be a gas thing
1	erm well i don t know there are new there are taps now apparently that you can have by your sink
1	yeah
1	and they do hot water cold water or or boiling water instantly now how they do that
1	that s just
1	must be some kind of special pause dur short trunc electri trunc electricity thing they go through i don t know
1	okay if it s a hadron collider spin off
1	well i yes it could be yeah
1	this is probably how they got the science funding for it
1	you mean
1	it s got it s got
1	we make
1	impact you see
1	you mean your kitchen might might be the discovery post higgs boson
1	yes
1	kind of thing
1	exactly vocal desc laugh that s right i mean after a while
1	yeah yeah
1	the science foundation in the european union could fund such a thing
1	well
1	but if it didn t guarantee impact in the real world what s the point of it
1	well i i of all the most unlikely places where string theory would be verified
1	vocal desc laugh
1	or negated i never thought of it being you know your kitchen
1	but but think how many households often look for string in these times
1	and they can never find it
1	can never find
1	when they need it
1	yeah that s
1	no
1	why you want a hadron collider in the background
1	yeah well
1	it s gonna find your string for you
1	that s gonna cost more than nine or ten thousand pounds though i suggest
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it could take more than a week or two
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	to put in
1	that s trunc ri trunc vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	trunc tha trunc yes and it could involve a certain
1	vocal desc laugh
1	amount of digging the road out
1	mm
1	underneath
1	or that would that won t be a discomfort for you because
1	oh no
1	because you would be at the centre of it
1	in the centre of it
1	i assume it ll be
1	vocal desc laugh it s unclear
1	bit of a problem even worse than the trams
1	all your unclear vocal desc laugh that s right
1	being unclear in anon type place at the moment vocal desc laugh
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	i think it ll be a bit deeper and longer than that
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes that s right
1	well we shall see about that but yours
1	well
1	would probably come first if it s trunc se trunc trunc se trunc if it s september
1	yes and i can i can erm er report back on high water
1	well it
1	low water pressure and goodness knows what else
1	it may well be that if i
1	if it s er yeah
1	still haven t got something done i shall approach you again
1	oh well you can by all means
1	and if you find out if you
1	come around and have a look at it and see what you think and you know whether it s worth it and all the rest of it cos i ll er it ll all be done and dusted by then should should be finished by the erm
1	start of term
1	end of end of the first week in september

1	yeah but i didn t apply i just too it out there
1	oh right

1	so i wouldn t actually have to go to anon nametype m type name to do it
1	well i don t think so you ring them up and find out i they wouldn t let me in
1	yeah
1	i got to the gate
1	yeah
1	and they said i ll take that to anon nametype m type name obviously it was addressed to the right person
1	the thing was the problem i unclear just unclear remember with money wasn t it

1	cos they didn t have a a cheque
1	a cheque yeah
1	so
1	they won t take cash they have to have cheque
1	oh they have to have a cheque
1	yeah oh i can write you a cheque

1	and scissors please
1	unclear there you go

1	yeah
1	ah morning anon nametype m type name
1	morning anon nametype m type name
1	breakfast
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	i wouldn t eat it
1	what
1	i wouldn t eat it
1	oh what that
1	oh manure
1	no he s just cleared out the guttering
1	oh
1	we swept the stuff off the roof cos it falls on you know it s erm like moss that grows on the roof
1	mm
1	unclear on the patio and makes it all trunc mil trunc you know green so we swept the roof off yesterday
1	ah
1	scrubbed the patio and unclear the guttering to
1	yeah
1	get rid of the rubbish so it doesn t wouldn t go down the drain otherwise it would unclear fat pause dur short never ending work i m afraid
1	erm i just phoned er the school s er school admissions
1	school admissions yeah
1	yeah
1	in anon type place
1	yeah pause dur short erm
1	yeah
1	checking out the feasibility of maybe anon nametype f type name coming to school here
1	mm
1	erm i haven t spoken to anon nametype f type name about it
1	no
1	er because i i thought i ll need to get a bit of information behind me before i do it
1	yeah
1	erm
1	of course
1	so
1	what did they say
1	well when i pause dur short enquired before i pause dur short said that er the admissions date
1	yeah is such and such
1	er was sort of january
1	january mm
1	and march at the latest pause dur short you know the guy i just spoke to an indian guy and vocal desc laugh i always i
1	you unclear conversation
1	well i i always have trouble with an indian accent i find it very difficult to understand them but anyway erm pause dur short they re they re it is possible still
1	i told you you don t believe me anon nametype m type name
1	well
1	they they have to by law keep a certain number of places available now it might not be your school of choice pause dur short erm that s the that that s the thing i mean you know if you know the schools in anon type place you choose a good one
1	well
1	but there s unclear you know unclear not much chance of getting into the best
1	there s erm there s two two aspects of this one is er which would i be applying for primary or junior
1	how old is she eight
1	she s eight she s gonna be nine in october
1	i think that makes her into trunc jun trunc er junior
1	but pause dur short i said erm pause dur short that er you unclear
1	nine in october
1	you you can yeah you can apply for both said it s er it might be a bit harder for junior cos all the places have gone but you might get in on on late admissions
1	mm
1	but also it trunc dep trunc depends on er where you live and i said well at the moment i m staying with sister and her family up at erm in anon type place but pause dur short i i haven t got any accommodation of my own said well they take into consideration erm your application according to where you live and
1	that s the trunc prob trunc that s what i said to you you have to decide which area you re gonna go to to be able to put your application that s why that family i m talking about that moved into our house
1	mm
1	they had to do it by a set you know they had to get choose where they wanted to live they selected the school chose where they wanted to live and searched in that area pause dur short for schools
1	well they said that they said
1	unclear
1	yeah but i can t they they said that i need proof of er
1	accommodation
1	accommodation right
1	yeah you will
1	so i can t
1	apply
1	i can t do it that way i can only apply giving the only address the the that i ve got which is here now
1	mm mm
1	yeah
1	uhu
1	so
1	which would mean you d know then move to need to move and if you got her into school you d need to move to that area yeah
1	right and then erm i mean how would that fit in with the housing er getting housing
1	well you just have to look for a flat
1	would would i trunc ha trunc would i have to find er trunc w trunc would of would er pause dur short how does it work i mean i
1	well you then have to look for a flat they if you put our address down then you d have to look for a flat in this area so that you were in the catchment area from the school
1	mm
1	but i mean
1	that would be difficult wouldn t it
1	well there aren t many flats in this area
1	mm
1	well there are that s not strictly true there s loads of them there s all down where anon nametype n type name lives all of those flats there
1	mm
1	you know there are available erm you just have to look online pause dur short but in the meantime put it down as our address but then you d have to make sure you otherwise you re stuck with trunc try trunc travelling trunc load trunc you know a long way to pick her up and drop her off and you know erm pause dur short i know you won t get into anon type place school because it is the most popular school in anon type place i would think other than the catholic school which they go you can travel all over to go to trunc trav trunc catholic school but erm pause dur short there are flats all down there but erm pause dur short the difficulty is they are very popular because they are in the anon type place catchment area
1	mm
1	which is where anon nametype m type name goes i mean anon nametype m type name s at that school just by sheer accident cos we didn t think anything about schooling at that time it just happened to be where the flat was erm but the one the one you would get into would be anon type place which is just up the road here
1	mm
1	erm near asda now i don t know where the nearest you know flats would be in that area what you d have to do would be to go to local estate agents such as erm unclear about three or four
1	yep with i i m told that it s very difficult to to get accommodation if you re on benefits pause dur short now i m going just i ve got a pension unclear that unclear
1	it is it is difficult it is erm more difficult because you know vocal desc laugh people on benefits quite often have sort of wrecked the joint and they don t look after the place and and you know
1	what what if i get erm erm a guarantor as it were
1	it wouldn t matter whether you ve got a guarantor or not the the big the thing well i suppose it may do but that isn t your unclear thing unclear at the moment you couldn t get any benefits cos you ve got too much money that s your problem right now you re not a dhss case
1	no well i erm i ve seen a house
1	you re a private erm individual
1	mm
1	and so there d be no problem you know they wanna know where you live erm what you know how much you ve got in your bank and what you do for a living well you re retired so you know
1	well i could presumably do do one step at a time
1	you d have to and then you d have to become a dhss one
1	mm
1	when your trunc mon trunc as i i was saying to you the other day you couldn t apply they wouldn t help you right now at all
1	so trunc a trunc any rent i ll have to pay
1	you d have to pay it trunc upfron trunc front yeah
1	well that unclear sort unclear of money would go very quickly unclear
1	yeah it would and then you ll become a dhss pause dur short and that s why i said to you she says but buy diamonds or antiques or something because that s money in the bank
1	yes
1	but you could sell in the future pause dur short and that s you know what some people would do in your situation but of course if you did have anon nametype f type name i mean right now you would only get help if you were dhss you would only get help as a single person
1	mm
1	which would be a lot less than if you ve got two people or three people
1	mm
1	obviously because that s how it s worked you know you only need to look after yourself kind of thing but if it as you person as you are at the current unclear you would erm and you re wanting place for anon nametype f type name you need to be looking for a two bedroom
1	yeah
1	or you would have to have a large one bedroom where you could sort of use the front room with a put you up or something
1	mm mm
1	that would work erm as long as that large enough to store all your things and anon nametype f type name s things
1	mm
1	erm so that that would be one option and then if anon nametype f type name didn t come you ve still only got a one bedroom and you would still be entitled to the same amount now if anon nametype f type name did come and you were you know obviously your money that had gone and you were dhss at that point you erm would have be not a single person any more you have a a dependent a child now if you only had a one bedroom there is a chance not not very good chance in this area that you could be rehoused with the two bedroom if you re in anon nametype f type name s area that would be quite quick i mean for instance anon nametype f type name had she had a two bedroom flat and one child erm november she had the baby was born she registered that you know with the council or housing association in erm december just before christmas i think or maybe trunc a trunc i don t know in december and she got a place and she s in it now brand new because in that area there are less people looking for housing in anon type place it s the worst possible
1	mm
1	scenarios and and you get families that are homeless they put them in b and b pause dur short and certainly single people just don t stand a look in you know because there s so many families that haven t got
1	mm
1	trunc acco trunc accommodation because the rents were so high and so it s kind of swings and roundabouts you have to decide what what you do how long you could hang on in with a single bedroom place with a a child you d have to then look for a a large a very large one which would
1	how much would that cost
1	well they re you know how how i ve no no idea they you know i couldn t give you a price cos they re all different prices i know a two bedroom is around about nine hundred to a thousand
1	right
1	pounds a month
1	would it would it not be better rather than registering saying my trunc ad trunc address is here saying it was in er give anon nametype m type name s address pause dur short because that d be easier finding a school and housing
1	why
1	no
1	there s no schools around where anon nametype m type name is is there
1	mm are there not i don t know anon nametype f type name
1	no no
1	oh
1	no it would need to well the best thing to do is get on the internet and look at the schools in the area and you ll see i think there is
1	well that s that s what unclear i ve got to apply anyway erm for an application for a school you this is the website here
1	yeah but trunc th trunc that s what i m saying that that s they want to know your erm address currently when you put that application in
1	yeah
1	so if you put anon nametype m type name s you d have to change everything your bank and everything to anon nametype f type name s
1	oh right okay
1	erm
1	yeah well that s not good and all so he doesn t want because he
1	yeah trunc exact trunc yeah there s complications there
1	yeah yeah
1	so erm pause dur short but trunc i trunc in this area there are three three well four actually if if you count the catholic school but you ll never get in there without the priests giving you a vocal desc laugh the nod erm here there s anon type place up here where behind here where anon nametype m type name goes er but that is one of the most popular schools in anon type place and even unclear people unclear who live in the area struggle to get in there then you ve got anon type place erm which was just off er anon type place which isn t far and you ve got anon type place up here
1	mm
1	now i know quite a few it s not the most popular because it s right on the edge of a pause dur short council estate
1	mm
1	so it s probably the least popular of those three anon type place is is always had a good reputation but you need to look on the map and see shall i go and get the the laptop and look on the
1	yeah okay
1	yeah see what the school the okay
1	unclear
1	do you want some toast
1	no i m fine thanks
1	are you sure
1	yeah yeah pause dur long vocal desc cough well i don t know pause dur short swings and roundabouts pause dur short what to do pause dur short not gonna be easy pause dur short i don t know whether it s gonna be possible or not pause dur short mm
1	age wise i m sure she d be in the junior
1	yeah
1	yeah pause dur short but erm pause dur short why unclear so did you unclear say she s eight
1	nine she s going to be nine end of october
1	nine unclear ten unclear they get they go up pause dur short i think at seven and eight pause dur short and that sort of erm
1	i think what about er erm language ability because she
1	well
1	she s obviously not
1	no pause dur short but you d be surprised how yeah
1	fluent in in english where well yeah the kids adapt really quickly i know that but er

1	ah
1	so trunc tho trunc none of those people will bring that but what your big problem you haven t got anything for anon nametype f type name
1	no i haven t given unclear up her unclear passport at the moment and that s what unclear that s unclear one
1	yeah
1	on the phone said i well i can get her passport over in china
1	yeah
1	vocal desc cough go to the shanghai british consul

1	but other i d have to pause dur short well i can t get the trunc p trunc i can t get the the passport before i apply
1	no that s what i m saying it s complicated pause dur short erm oh so it s junior school isn t it we want junior pause dur long yeah unclear okay unclear that pause dur short if we can enlarge that
1	vocal desc cough
1	right so that s er pause dur short erm you can see where erm anon nametype m type name lives down there doesn t he pause dur short and we are pause dur short we are anon type place here we re in there okay
1	mm mm
1	now oh they re not showing the schools very well anon nametype m type name s school is right up here
1	mm mm
1	and then pause dur short oh here they are oh right it s showing them in anon type place by the looks of things pause dur short why where have the schools gone then pause dur short oh it s just showing a map now
1	mm
1	that s strange cos they were there just now let s see if i can go back
1	i don t know it seems very unlikely trying to juggle everything unclear i haven t got her passport i haven t got an address unclear those unclear
1	no that s that oh they had a unclear biggest thing unclear passport erm and documentation for anon nametype f type name you haven t i did say that to you when you came you know make sure you ve got a birth certificate and unclear things unclear like that so that you can erm
1	but that s all in chinese isn t it
1	ah
1	and it s on a family book
1	right pause dur short i don t know how that s that works out pause dur short let s see pause dur short as soon as you take that all the schools go that s weird pause dur short look tried to pause dur short look they re on there now pause dur short unclear i want unclear to get them back vocal desc laugh they re the let s move that across
1	mm
1	right so anon type place junior school that s the one up by us that s the one i was talking about
1	right
1	i think that s called anon type address it s in anon type address erm pause dur short there s the anon type place which is up by anon type place which is you know if you moved up there that wouldn t be too bad pause dur short erm anon type place school which is pause dur short unclear where anon type place is pause dur short well there s anon type place anon type place s not there anon type place pause dur short that s unclear out unclear right out pause dur short you ve got over here you ve got anon type place unclear that s really weird because erm what s his name s not on that that s erm pause dur short er anon type place isn t on there that s the one in anon type place that s easy to get into pause dur short that s quite a you know a pause dur short you know a possibility er the anon type place is a nice school anon type place junior school that i can t think where that is pause dur short i ve actually got the reviews here look what s it say there
1	well seeing seeing as i ve got nothing no documents for it
1	no
1	for her at all
1	no
1	i haven t even got photos
1	to be honest you won t get her in for september because there s too much to do
1	ah
1	you would have to look at doing it after september you know cos you go over there in june
1	vocal desc cough yeah
1	and try and er you know get agreement from anon nametype f type name you d need it in writing that you she s prepared to let her come with you
1	yeah
1	unclear to unclear live pause dur short you d need the passport you d need all of that and once it s over here then you know you can bring that with you and then you know work on it from this end
1	yeah
1	so then you d be back i don t know when you d be back but when you come back when does your your erm thing erm
1	visa expire
1	mm
1	september
1	no no not your visa your erm pause dur short your your erm chinese visa expires then
1	mid september
1	right
1	but i i mean i i intend to apply for a resident s permit actually
1	yeah yeah pause dur short i don t know how that how that works what you mean you can go backwards and forward anytime
1	well if i got yeah resident s permit i don t need a visa
1	right okay pause dur short so let s assume that you apply for that and but unclear i was thinking more your concessions flight concessions when does that trunc e trunc end
1	oh unclear six months unclear
1	six months so it s when was it
1	so that was just before trunc ch trunc the ninth of december pause dur short so that
1	so january february march april may june pause dur short beginning of june
1	yeah
1	that s so then mind you if you re bringing anon nametype f type name over you re gonna have to pay for her flight and
1	mm
1	you would only be on standby so you couldn t be on a standby
1	no
1	and not get on and she got on
1	yeah
1	so that you wouldn t wanna be doing that pause dur short but erm pause dur short i don t know anon nametype f type name might be able to get you a trunc hot trunc hotline ticket they call them which is a bit of a reduction this is the erm anon type place which shows unclear that s not far from its erm
1	so to to get this concessions i ll have to go back before the ninth of june
1	yeah to be for you to yeah back there and be back here or whatever it be on concessions you ve got to be back by the ninth of june to still be on
1	and be back here oh
1	otherwise your flight back will get you won t get your flight back
1	well unclear i i wouldn t be able to go over there do everything i ve got to go over there for an operation
1	i know
1	yeah and i ve got to apply for a passport and
1	ah
1	i m not going won t be able to do it
1	well firstly it depends when you go you know if you went earlier
1	well yeah but she don t want me to to do that do you know unclear
1	unclear anon nametype f type name tough innit what she wants
1	well where am i gonna stay
1	mm that s the the problem pause dur short well what happens when you go over in june where are you gonna stay then
1	well i ll have to stay initially there but then got to up to anon type place to vocal desc cough er for unclear her unclear operation
1	to be honest if she came over here she would have her operation done free
1	yeah but pause dur short look at what
1	how urgent is that
1	yeah well i don t know and also have to pause dur short whether it can wait another year
1	what the operation
1	yeah
1	it wouldn t be necessarily be another year you know it just depends what what the problem was some surgery
1	yeah unclear
1	some surgery is quick some surgery is not
1	but if i was gonna bring her over for next year
1	i don t mean for next year if you didn t make september but came by christmas or something unclear to i don t mean wait another year i mean you know by christmas you couldn t fix it all in june and get it all sorted out here by june pause dur short but if you went over in june started sorting the paperwork in june pause dur short in china came back say in july and then from september you would start sorting everything here pause dur short wouldn t you
1	mm
1	i know it s i know it s a lot and it seems seems a lot but you d have to do it step by step the most complicated part to me is the chinese bit cos they don t understand that any of that i understand what happens here what you need to do here and it you know most of it can happen quite quickly here
1	mm
1	once you ve got that unclear until you ve got anon nametype f type name s permission passport pause dur short and medical even if it is in chinese
1	mm
1	erm and presumably anon nametype f type name will have her own passport and not a family book
1	mm
1	to do that pause dur short so anon nametype f type name would have to agree that wouldn t she pause dur short to get that done now if you can get past that then i think it s plain sailing this end from my point of view
1	mm
1	cos i understand what ll happen it you know it s it s quite difficult to coordinate it so the time is difficult but you d be just say you d apply for a school say with this as your residence and anon nametype f type name s residence initially
1	but it s no in that case unclear the timing s too short to get everything organised to get entry in september unclear she won t
1	well i i i don t know whether it is i don t know how long it would take to organise the chinese end but for me that s the bit it seems insurmountable to me pause dur short cos i don t know how it all works and as you say she hasn t got a passport currently she s on a family book you haven t got anon nametype f type name s permission pause dur short you d need that in writing pause dur short like you know probably signed by a solicitor or something i would imagine which gives permission for her to come pause dur short erm and you also need anon nametype f type name to be on board and you know pause dur short kind of trunc tho trunc those are the things i think i find difficult to
1	mm
1	visualise how that would work out if that all works out then and you bring anon nametype f type name over then it i don t think it s you know you can do you can get accommodation within a week
1	can you get emergency schooling and what would happen
1	well you wouldn t him you might not get in in the first week or two she d probably unclear want unclear a week or two to
1	unclear no unclear
1	trunc as trunc adjust
1	no but i mean would it would it be a problem missing the school entry date in september
1	it would no why
1	no okay
1	unclear you know cos it ll be it ll be a new entry for her unclear whenever she unclear leave unclear
1	yeah yeah sure
1	so and to be honest it it could be unclear easier unclear and trunc g trunc because erm pause dur short she ll be nine she won t be going in with a new cohort of kids that come from infants they go at seven seven plus
1	mm
1	right so she ll have missed that last year sept last september they they all went up year six unclear in year seven at seven and eight they transfer so she won t be going in with the new cohort of kids she ll be going in new when they go up to the next class
1	mm
1	erm and erm pause dur short usually what they would do is they d give some children the responsibility of being trunc hom trunc a mentor you know a couple of children just show her round and look after her in school and be her mentor in school so for missing september it s not like it s
1	mm
1	like everyone s gonna be new in september
1	mm
1	they ll be already in their classrooms by by then by the time she s nearly nine erm pause dur short so pause dur short i don t think that so much is set whether it s september or christmas it s gonna be new for her
1	mm
1	and quite quite difficult for for her but at the same time hopefully it ll be quite interesting and pause dur short tell you what the air ll be a lot better for her
1	vocal desc cough yeah
1	and erm
1	vocal desc cough
1	and and you know i pause dur short that to me the bit in the in china i don t understand enough about so i can t say yeah that ll work out alright i ll just i don t know how anon nametype f type name will react i don t know how long it takes to get a passport i don t know whether she vocal desc laugh she was signed for a passport and let me take her or you know i don t know anon nametype f type name
1	mm well i ve got a pause dur short no i ll talk to her this weekend i ll i ll ask her about what she thinks about it cos unclear every time i pause dur short nearly every time unclear walking unclear to something different changing the situation and
1	that s right cos so what what anon nametype f type name unclear is turmoil
1	yeah
1	you know
1	well it s not it s been pretty vocal desc cough steady so far but the plan is now that we can t afford to keep her in this school and so erm unclear that s why she s talking about going back to anon type place erm
1	so he s not able to support her
1	i ve got no idea
1	i don t know anon nametype f type name i i but she strikes me as being the sort who erm money would be
1	yeah
1	very important to her
1	yeah
1	and she s i think when she stops sinking er stops to think and think well actually do you know what this isn t such a really good arrangement pause dur short moving to anon type place not
1	mm
1	not not having the school any more and and having to work to support herself really that s what she s saying
1	mm
1	and that s if he goes you know so right now it might be a pause dur short you know not a not a erm a lot of a permanent arrangement it might be an idea that she s toying with and trying to struggle with
1	mm mm
1	and that s why i say to i think you should write an email to her saying i m really pleased that you think you ve found someone you want to be with and that s that s really great erm i hope he s able to support you erm as you ve always you know the way you ve been used to
1	mm
1	and that erm and you know i d like to think he could pay for erm pause dur short anon nametype f type name s you know to support anon nametype f type name you ve selected someone who can look after anon nametype f type name well pause dur short but i m concerned that if that s the case why are you having to consider going to anon type place which would move you and anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	if he s not able to look after you
1	no to put all that in an email her english isn t all that good i don t know if she d understand all that
1	isn t it pause dur short well isn t it all that good it s not enough to understand that
1	well speaking s better than reading
1	right mm pause dur short you should get someone to translate it for her or
1	mm
1	explain it pause dur short unclear in basic words couldn t we
1	mm
1	but that s what i my thing would be is like question what she s doing make her question what she s doing and check whether she is absolutely certain about it pause dur short careful that iron s on darling
1	i turned it off
1	that would be my first reaction
1	mm
1	and then you can say if that is the case and you feel you erm what there is a future for you with this chap pause dur short erm i would be happy to have anon nametype f type name here and erm you can have your you know opportunity to see anon nametype f type name whenever you want pause dur short and she she d have a good trunc ed trunc free education pause dur short hm pause dur short free education free erm cos anon nametype f type name rang didn t she free education free medical pause dur short erm
1	unclear mm unclear
1	and opportunities that she hasn t might not have in anon type place
1	mm
1	i don t know what it s like there but you you know i m just going by what you say it s a country place is it
1	mm yeah
1	yeah
1	unclear yeah unclear
1	i i i can t imagine anon nametype f type name cos she s trendy
1	mm
1	she likes nice clothes will she live in a place like that
1	well there s unclear always cities and unclear you know just so anon type place is a province it isn t all that rich but then there are cities and and cities and towns and all these places to go and and
1	is there close by
1	yeah
1	mm pause dur short well i don t know but you know that she d be happy for her to is there schools there that look decent i suppose
1	unclear
1	erm it s i m
1	vocal desc cough
1	i unclear would unclear put questions in her mind about whether it s a permanent arrangement er you know right now she s you know think she s fallen in love with someone but it was very different when you were paying the bills
1	mm
1	and suddenly you re not
1	mm
1	and now she s thinking hang on pause dur short so what does she want now you to come back and eek out an existence and pay the bills
1	no i don t think erm
1	unclear or unclear look after anon nametype f type name
1	i don t we haven t even talked about that other than it s i don t think er
1	what s what s always see i don t know her but i m just trying to think what her motives are what sort of person she is
1	yeah
1	i don t know pause dur short looking at it from a different aspect pause dur short you know pause dur short whether she whether it is whether she changes her mind frequently or
1	oh god yeah like the wind
1	well there you go so this this idea might just be a
1	vocal desc misc oh sorry
1	sort of a a threat to you at the moment
1	yeah
1	that might be her saying oh you know i pause dur short are you gonna see anon nametype f type name
1	yep
1	well tell her safe journey
1	yes i will
1	unclear
1	unclear uncle anon nametype m type name
1	pardon
1	i said and unclear tell her unclear hurry home
1	yep
1	not back till saturday pause dur short erm so i don t know that would be my first thing that i would suggest put it in an email sort of some questions to her to make her question herself and and say you know i m happy for you if that s what you want to do if if you think it s right if anon nametype f type name and you think it s right for you and that you can be looked after unclear kind of unclear like pause dur short and then she ll she ll be annoyed by that cos she won t like it she won t like it you saying yeah okay go ahead that s what effectively you re saying pause dur short and then you can say alternative if you don t think he s gonna be there forever you don t think he s gonna be a good father erm i erm i can look after him over here
1	did work it well
1	and that s what you say she can have free school erm and i ll get unclear that pause dur short where we can live near a park where she can go to the park and the sea unclear send it to her
1	mm
1	and free free medical pause dur short and trunc manta trunc trunc manta trunc fantastic opportunity for someone who can speak trunc mand trunc speak and write mandarin
1	mm
1	the future here everyone want you know all private schools like anon type place college they they they re all doing mandarin
1	mm
1	cos it s the language that is gonna be needed in the future so i don t know that s how i would play it with anon nametype f type name with anon nametype f type name
1	yeah okay
1	right i shall return
1	okay see you in a while darling
1	in a short while
1	okay
1	drive carefully
1	yeah
1	well that s how i d do it i d send her an email question it making her question her you know what s going on or think about the future rather than oh what what can i do to get out of this situation think about where what the reality is she s committing she s committing herself to pause dur short so to say then you know if if if it s not if you think there s any doubt in your mind that it might not work pause dur short i will have anon nametype f type name while you work you trunc wor trunc work out your problems
1	well i don t wanna say that cos trunc that trunc that ll annoy her erm i i what about saying pause dur short erm that er well just ask her about unclear not the the possibility would she be agreeable to anon nametype f type name coming over here now erm rather than later
1	mm
1	er because that way erm i i ll be with her and i can look after her and i can get her into school and erm vocal desc cough pause dur short er pause dur short there was free health and free schools and the the air s much cleaner et cetera et cetera but apart from that because she already well why don t you get a place to live and i said well i already said that i can t get a place to live until i get a job because people will unclear
1	mm
1	who rent properties so now i m gonna have to change that
1	mm unclear say i i now found i can
1	well well say that
1	trunc an trunc anyone can
1	i can if i if i ve got a child
1	mm
1	if i ve got a child then i can
1	because she ll think you only want anon nametype f type name for the unclear
1	yeah yeah that s true
1	you say the situation is that i ve not just found that i am eligible and i can rent a place pause dur short here
1	mm
1	erm i ve now found that i you know some contacts to help me find accommodation pause dur short oh thank you erm and and erm see if she will erm pause dur short and say and and i but i won t i won t do that unless i know that anon nametype f type name s gonna be able to come
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	it s you know i i won t bother with the expense if if i if unclear but if anon nametype f type name s coming if you allow anon nametype f type name to come then i would erm be able to get a place
1	mm
1	why did you say to her you couldn t get a place then without cos you unclear know she s unclear got a job if that s not
1	well she s cos she s pushing me about in
1	oh right
1	but er to find somewhere to live
1	but why was she trunc fi trunc pushing you why does she care where you live
1	oh i don t know pause dur short i don t know
1	you say well you should have said well i unclear quite unclear you know i quite like staying with anon nametype m type name
1	well yeah well unclear
1	he s good company
1	well yeah and trunc ther trunc there s
1	you know why should she care where you live
1	mm
1	so you you know trunc ha trunc having spoken to you erm i ve decided to start looking for somewhere to live and i can unclear find unclear i ve you know several opportunity
1	vocal desc cough
1	and send her pictures from the internet unclear from unclear anon type place pause dur short you know they re all over pause dur short so she now thinks you re not able to find unclear over unclear there good support unclear that s what she s gonna say but you haven t got anywhere to live pause dur short gonna be her first thing so maybe you say erm for my part
1	and she s gonna ask me about how much money i ve got
1	well say erm going down fast
1	mm
1	but i get
1	but that s gonna be another bone of contention erm money in the future unclear
1	well her
1	cos i i won t be able to get myself my hands on my property cos it s unclear all unclear pause dur short ones in her name solely and the other s in both our names
1	well you re never going to go back unclear are you now
1	no
1	and you
1	no
1	whatever happens you re never going to get that from her
1	no
1	cos you know pause dur short she she s got it and she she unclear knew unclear that from the beginning
1	mm yeah
1	so pause dur short erm i think you should say right no i i erm after talking to you and asking why i haven t got a unclear flat unclear i decided i ought to really look more you know more closely and i found a can there are lots of properties
1	that that yeah
1	that i can rent
1	but there won t until under no
1	yeah there s no point unless i think anon nametype f type name s going to come erm i quite staying with anon nametype m type name he s good company and erm pause dur short but if i thought anon nametype f type name was gonna come i erm rent a place and find it all in the locality pause dur short a good school for anon nametype f type name
1	vocal desc cough
1	so pause dur short but you ought to ask your questions you know about is this guy gonna look after anon nametype f type name is he do you think he s gonna has he got a family pause dur short already you know so many questions you know you know you re thinking about your future with him so that s really good i hope he s going has he got already got a family is he going to be a good father pause dur short you know is he going to look after anon nametype f type name as well i would be asking all those questions and she needs to ask herself them pause dur short she s probably not thinking about them but she shouldn t
1	i think it s better to to put this in an email rather than
1	i do because she would take stop and come back to it and backwards and forwards
1	mm
1	if you say it over the phone it s kind of the heat of the moment
1	mm
1	you can t remember everything that s said
1	mm
1	but if by in an email people go back to it and read it again and it will be a a reminder to her that they re you know right now it seemed like a good idea to her but what is the reality and she may not wanna tell you if he s got a family or not
1	mm
1	what his financial situation but if you ask her she doesn t have to answer but she ll be thinking well it s really bad i can t tell him or it s really good i ll tell him vocal desc laugh pause dur short so pause dur short but i i think to be honest the only way people trunc remain trunc you can stop and think about it properly is if it s in writing because it s all in the heat of the moment you remember snippets of conversation but not all of it
1	mm
1	not the fine detail erm and you ve you ve only remembered the bit that you try to bat off pause dur short you know if you say on well you know it s either unclear she ll remember what her retaliation is but later on and she might be angry at it but when she s got an email she can t be angry and retaliate she might be angry about it but she ll go back and look at it pause dur short she ll go back and chew it over in her mind and it s all there everything you said so you do have to carefully word it
1	mm
1	so i d if i was you i d trunc emai trunc er er do it in a erm word a word
1	draft
1	yeah trunc wo trunc and word document until you get it saying exactly what you want to say in a simply form simple form that will make her think deeply about her actions and what where you know where it s leading no just this week this month next year but long term and then once you ve done that you can finish it off by saying you might even start it by saying after talking to you about you know renting a place i decided i ought to look into it and i found i can so there are quite a number of places i m looking at
1	mm
1	erm so end that bit then say i m happy that you are you know gonna have someone that you re happy with erm i hope he s you know a nice person who ll look after you and anon nametype f type name and erm pause dur short be able to keep you erm pause dur short but i don t understand if he is able to why you re moving to anon type place
1	well that s cos the money for the school
1	i know why
1	mm
1	i know cos he can t afford to pay for the school
1	mm unclear she would expect me to
1	but unclear what i m saying hm
1	she ll expect me to i m surprised she hadn t asked me already
1	well she probably is but you just say like tough innit you you find someone else
1	mm
1	is he gonna look after you is he gonna look after anon nametype f type name i can look after anon nametype f type name if he doesn t want to but i m not gonna
1	well i don t want him to i wanna unclear look after her unclear
1	i know but you you that s she she doesn t you don t want her to know that do you cos you ll go well you re not having unclear it unclear obviously you can pay and you can whatever but you kind of do it in a much more subtle way as a you know i i m i m really pleased you found someone who can look after you and anon nametype f type name and and you know pay pay to support you but i don t understand why you need to to go to anon type place if he s able to look after you pause dur short and basically he can t can he cos she s gotta go to work she s gotta go there for schooling pause dur short so then you say if it you know are you sure it s gonna work out is is he gonna be there for the long term i hope so but you know what if all else fails now i m getting my my life together her and i m you know i ve got i m gonna rent a flat if that is a problem i would have anon nametype f type name to bring her up here where she would have free school free medical fresh air and quite a large family of
1	i d like to unclear here the er erm accent it more on the that i want her rather than the money
1	well personally
1	if he s not gonna pay for it then i the i will take her unclear it s not the way to go about it i think
1	i i think it isn t actually unclear i think cos she ll go well you re not having i m not doing anything to please you
1	mm
1	so it s not about that what you ve got to say is kind of like erm make it clear that you re gonna get your life together here you re gonna rent a flat no matter what and if he wants to look after you two but he obviously can t so you point that out in a subtle way
1	yeah
1	erm and she start going oh hang on a minute
1	but then she might question well why do i want to apply for a resident s permit in china
1	so that you can go backwards and forwards
1	yeah
1	to see her
1	yeah pause dur short so i can be closer to her
1	well you you can go regularly to see her
1	yeah
1	and because she told you to pause dur short i ve listened to what you said apply for a resident s erm i ll do that so that i can trunc ho trunc hopefully go backwards and forwards to see anon nametype f type name erm and i m renting a flat here because i you re right i do need to set up on my own
1	vocal desc cough
1	you re right i m doing what you said now your pause dur short let s talk about you kind of attitude this is point out where the shortcomings might be in her plan in a subtle way and then back it up and say however whatever your plans you know if you don t think it s gonna be as easy as that i am happy to bring anon nametype f type name up here where she would have all these positive cos you you don t wanna point out what you want you wanna point out what s good for anon nametype f type name cos
1	mm
1	she doesn t care what you want
1	no
1	she cares what hopefully cares with what anon nametype f type name will have
1	mm
1	more than what you want you know you wanna be with your child and tough vocal desc laugh as far as she s concerned but she should be listening to what s best for anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	and she s moving to anon type place for school
1	mm
1	you know but she still hasn t got free medical she still hasn t got fresh air although is it more better air over there i don t know
1	erm yeah it s better than
1	where they are
1	mm
1	mm pause dur short so and then you say when i when i find a place or you know when i m i m unclear when you trunc doc trunc i you know i m you can send her stuff that you might want to look at i m gonna look at this today pause dur short let her see do it more by email than your phone calls you don t have to wait a week to speak to her
1	mm
1	where it gets all heated and
1	mm
1	difficult you can say what you want to say to her without the retaliation
1	mm
1	though that that ll be how i would play it pause dur short very much more subtle saying you re pleased for her pause dur short which will annoy her
1	unclear
1	won t it cos you re not you know desperate you re giving her permission to go ahead and move to anon type place
1	mm
1	aren t you you know i m not gonna fight you go go to anon type place let him unclear look after you pause dur short sound like it i mean either way she s gonna do it
1	mm
1	so better to her think well actually he is happy for me to do that and i m gonna have to do it he s not coming and he s not gonna pay for everything again pause dur short and you can say now you ve got your pension details set up and your money tax credits coming in erm and you ll find out unclear you unclear situations improved a little
1	well she s gonna yeah pause dur short she s gonna she s gonna ask about the money i said well if you can t find a job where where are you gonna get the money from
1	well you say and i get pension credits over here we get benefits if we re not able to work and that s why you know you can survive
1	mm
1	trunc we trunc it s only on you you get it you can t give it to her
1	no
1	so she can t have it it s you know i get i get help with whatever i need
1	if she ll say you won t you won t have enough money to put pay the flat and if you re not working
1	well say i get benefits
1	mm
1	well it s what you do you get benefits if you aren t earning enough then you get help to live everybody does pause dur short well unclear she ll unclear know that i mean you know you you unclear that answer to her pause dur short i ll help you do it
1	okay
1	you you need to do that quite quickly send that to her to give her something to think about pause dur short anon nametype f type name s presumably still at school is she
1	yeah she was she s on holiday at the moment but erm
1	yeah pause dur short but at the end pause dur short of that
1	mm pause dur short next week she goes back
1	she send she s happy to send her off week after week to a school where she doesn t you know she doesn t know the teachers anon nametype f type name doesn t know the teachers yeah she s got lots of friends and she s got get to know the teachers but you know it it s not much different except she doesn t see her every week pause dur short but she can see her by skype the same as you do
1	mm
1	can t she pause dur short the only thing i your big problem will be if you get anon nametype f type name over here i think she will take quite a while to settle and i think she ll say i want my mum
1	mm yeah i m sure
1	i wanna go home pause dur short that will be the biggest sorting the the the documentation in china
1	unclear of course unclear yeah
1	and then anon nametype f type name settling in period where with the best will in the world even if she isn t happy unclear there she she ll want to be back to normal
1	unclear certain she s always had her mother you see
1	yeah but she hasn t
1	that s that s
1	she s she s at school all the time
1	well that s it and
1	i don t they re not close you seem to say
1	no pause dur short well i don t know so a little girl needs her mother but as i say she she s not been a brilliant mother
1	oh and what about her grandmother is she close to them
1	mm not really
1	no pause dur short not been part of her life
1	not much no
1	no exactly pause dur short so you know that s a huge upheaval for her anyway so what she s talking about is a huge upheaval erm and possibly a very uncertain life with this guy pause dur short and what happens if this guy isn t around any more pause dur short is i dunno what wage is and what erm what erm anon nametype f type name can do to earn a living is she able to earn enough to support herself and and anon nametype f type name would she live with her parents what would she do
1	i don t know
1	i can t see anon nametype f type name living that kind of life what from what you tell me about her
1	no
1	and and i bet she can t really and when when you talked about going to anon type place no where did you
1	anon type place
1	no when you talked about going to where your flat is
1	oh the anon type place
1	yeah she didn t want to go there
1	unclear
1	why
1	well now i know why
1	why because of a man
1	yeah
1	right so now that man is on the scene but she s going to have to go to anon type place isn t that further
1	oh it is a lot further
1	mm
1	so i d i i assume that er she s worked all that out and that he s going
1	mm
1	but er
1	so he says
1	i don t know i don t know
1	but then that s what you say to her you know i presume you ve worked it alright you ve given consideration for all these things and that you re all going you ll be go there and unclear they ll unclear look after you you ll both work is what sort of jobs are available in anon type place is she able to what is she able to do to earn a living
1	yeah i m gonna have to put all this in very basic terms because unclear
1	no but i m asking you what sort of job would she do
1	i i ve got no idea
1	what she s capable of doing what unclear sort of unclear what would she turn to
1	unclear god unclear knows
1	so you know is it is it good pay over there or pause dur long erm pause dur short all of those things she to be thinking about and if you ask the questions pause dur short she ll start thinking more deeply about what she s doing
1	mm
1	and she might then say well actually i can have my cake and eat it if you have anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	it depends what sort of person she i don t know unclear her unclear
1	okay pause dur short ah
1	all you can do is suss it out to unclear
1	right well unclear draft unclear it
1	and unclear went up with saw
1	erm pause dur short erm
1	and trying to get some questions together
1	mm
1	and we re you know and then we can phrase it in a way that you think anon nametype f type name will understand
1	mm
1	and pause dur short go from there that will be my advice pause dur short question her pause dur short free her up to go and do it cos i don t think she really wants to do that either pause dur short and then offer a way out
1	mm
1	is it alright this cream
1	it s good er
1	pardon i yes darling
1	yeah it s a good strategy
1	i m good at strategy pause dur short get get your resident s done and tell her you re doing it so that you can come and see it erm unclear kids unclear see it anon nametype f type name whenever you can afford it pause dur short you re gonna get a flat here cos you re right i should get my get my life together fortunately my pension now is you know and if i don t have enough money the benefits will kick in and pay my rent pause dur short won t pay all of it unclear it ll unclear pay most of it erm pause dur short so i m gonna you know start looking forward rather than
1	mm
1	in other words you go forward i ll go forward pause dur short but if you want you know i ll have anon nametype f type name pause dur short offer s always there pause dur short so i think that would be my suggestion
1	okay
1	and then pause dur short if she s
1	unclear
1	what darling
1	you ve got unclear start unclear
1	chocolate brownies mm i like my chocolate brownie pause dur short getting unclear don t they
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short and then once all that is done if she says trunc an trunc say well if she says you know okay in which case you can have anon nametype f type name pause dur short to live with you you you say right okay well in which case erm we ll look at the paperwork when i come pause dur short tell her you wanna take anon nametype f type name on holiday
1	if she wants me to she already asked me what are you gonna do with her unclear ah well i ll take her to the trunc cinem trunc the the the er seaside
1	mm
1	unclear
1	so you should have probably told anon nametype f type name that
1	mm
1	mm pause dur short well you could offer anon nametype f type name you can come and live at the seaside
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and see the sea every day if you want to vocal desc laugh
1	okay well thanks for that anon nametype f type name
1	well we ll do it i ll i ll start on it and then if it s any good you can look at it
1	okay
1	and you can chop and change it and write it so in a way that you think she will
1	well unclear watch this then unclear
1	understand
1	yeah
1	and erm go from there
1	yeah
1	and then once once you get that bar once you get that passport thing sorted then unclear which i think unclear for me the only thing i can t i can t visualise how you would do it or how it would work out for you once you ve done that then you worry about schools and accommodation pause dur short otherwise you d be paying for it
1	yeah
1	you know
1	well yeah one slip of the tongue and unclear she s up for it first
1	yeah she might be and if she s not you ve offered and you know the she has the option at any time that if she changes her mind
1	that s excellent
1	just leave it on the unclear table unclear anon nametype m type name i ll unclear sort it unclear pause dur short so i think you know i think she might go well that s you know what that might be better for anon nametype f type name
1	mm pause dur short okay
1	and who knows we ll see won t we
1	yeah
1	if i was you i wouldn t bank on anything with her but
1	no
1	you know you just don t know what her thoughts are sounds like you don t know and i don t know cos i don t know unclear her unclear cos i don t know
1	mm
1	never met her but
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	could be that this bloke could raise her if it s a good idea
1	mm
1	isn t it
1	well pause dur short i m sure that er in many ways that she d prefer me to pause dur short for her not to have to have the er
1	responsibilities
1	responsibility and the inconvenience of it all pause dur short although she said her mother can look after her in anon type place
1	well
1	but it s a horrible farm dirty old trunc f trunc
1	is it
1	trunc build trunc yeah
1	mm
1	it really is disgusting er
1	but if you sound as though you re worried about that she ll think that she s got a chance that you ll cough up and stop her that from happening
1	mm
1	but if you say well you know perhaps it is best you know it s the only way you ll be able to do it kind of thing unclear if i m not helping
1	mm
1	will you you know pause dur short your decision you do it i m not gonna help but if all else fails pause dur short you know i ll still have anon nametype f type name

0	then went to a pub and stayed round anon nametype f type name s
0	oh yeah
0	then came here got changed then went back out again to go see er ed byrne at the junction
0	trunc liter trunc it was ridiculous i was like er
0	i m making some hard boiled eggs to make an egg salad for lunch
0	erm about so it was quite long
0	yeah
0	sunday was fine i actually quite like working there it s just tiring
0	mm indeed
0	i enjoy working cos of the people not cos of the work
0	unclear don t you need to leave them in for like ten minutes or something
0	yeah true
0	so they ll go hard eventually you know
0	mm
0	no he was supposed to come to the comedy last night and then i decided that i didn t want to go with him but
0	yeah i bought the tickets you know like it was my he didn t pay for any of them it was my ticket and i was like well you know what cos he was like he he annoyed me and he we went out last weekend as friends obviously
0	oh yeah i know like yeah my point was that i was trying to get out i was trying to get out of him coming to the comedy so i just used it as a excuse for not wanting him to come to the comedy
0	i didn t say that in like those words i said it very nicely but i was like i d rather just go with anon nametype f type name he was like okay i was like well gutted sorry not like we re dating anymore is it
0	exactly
0	you don t need to care about them
0	yeah
0	yeah still pretty good for a flat though
0	did you ring her though
0	just yeah like turn it off the boil and then just leave them in there for like a few minutes and then drain the water and you can just leave them in the pan they will continue to cook cos it s an egg so it s not like it will go hard
0	so don t worry it s all good i love peeling hard boiled eggs that s one of the most like satisfying things to do as sad as that sounds god i m a loser
0	use a slotted slotted spoon to transfer the hot eggs immediately into cold water and then leave them to cool for ten minutes and then they ll be really easy to peel apparently
0	yeah true
0	yeah so i guess
0	there s loads of weird with things like that like anon nametype f type name s trunc da trunc anon nametype f type name went home for the weekend to france and her dad was talking to her and she was varnishing something and then she dipped the brush and he was like no now you need to clean the brush anon nametype f type name and she s like okay so she went to the sink and was like washing it he was like no no no anon nametype f type name you ve got to use white spirit do you not have any common sense like why do you not know this and she was like
0	no idea
0	it s only common sense if you know it
0	what spanner
0	what spanner are you on about he goes that one blah blah you know whatever special name she s like i don t know what you re talking about go away
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	mm pause dur short i suppose but it doesn t really change anything really pause dur short well it changes that they live apart
0	yeah
0	yeah i suppose but then
0	i d rather them be happy apart than like be miserable together definitely
0	i think it would be easier if you were older if you re younger
0	true but it s weird how nowadays most people not most people that s a complete generalisation but a lot of people actually their parents aren t together it s like becoming weirder having not weirder but it s becoming less common to have your parents still together is some places
0	it is weird
0	mm but then anon nametype f type name my the girl in anon nametype f type name her parents are getting divorced and they ve been married something like fifty years
0	scrawling through shit
0	yeah and you re telling me that she doesn t have five minutes to send me a text saying hi anon nametype f type name you alright
0	how are you
0	yeah
0	exactly i saw anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name s really good bless her
0	to be fair not that i would be angry about that but i d be a bit like oh cos you wouldn t want anyone to know that you were nervous would you really
0	yeah but she no she didn t know she didn t tell them she just told me we were discussing it and she was like he s really like nervous about meeting people but that s just what i would say to you like even if it was just like saying well i had a boyfriend coming i was it s just general stuff you d say to someone i think
0	i suppose but
0	yeah
0	oh dear
0	i know you shouldn t judge someone else who they date but it s just like you can do better
0	i think he is yeah apparently like he got really angry with her because they she went on a hen night and one of her like she had to do like a task or something and one of her tasks was to like grind on this old man and he got really angry at her about it
0	he s probably really insecure
0	yeah not good
0	i don t think they are they re the couple that haven t had sex since they started going out
0	since christmas six months
0	unclear it d be pretty easy
0	it s be pretty easy to nail them wouldn t it vocal desc laugh
0	okay
0	you know when someone doesn t like you when they can t get it up like
0	yeah i just don t think he likes her enough
0	no
0	i think she s a yeah it s taken her so long to get a boyfriend that she thinks she s kind of got to like settle for what she s got
0	is there a reason why he s sticking around
0	i think he just a he doesn t want to hurt her feelings
0	doesn t want to hurt her feelings
0	and b probably they just you know like they re friends and they probably do get on really really well
0	maybe he s just kidding himself maybe that s why he can t get it up cos he s just kidding himself
0	ah men

1	yes so erm pause dur short anon nametype m type name gave me er an idea er cos he he s er more or less decided to work for himself pause dur short and start his own business and he said he went down to pause dur short er pause dur short erm hong kong and managed to er
1	vocal desc misc
1	to get erm a visa for starting his own business
1	in china
1	yeah
1	right pause dur short what does he fancy doing there
1	well he s gotten an idea i m not sure quite exactly what it entails but it s about er pause dur short i think er starting up some business online pause dur short er he s very good with computers unlike me pause dur short erm and pause dur short i think he went down to hong kong and managed to convince them that pause dur short what he d got planned was feasible so i think i think he s got it
1	cos hong kong s chinese now isn t it of course yeah
1	yeah pause dur short yeah but unfortunately they pause dur short they trunc ca trunc well it is erm pause dur short it was the trunc sy trunc system with hong kong is that it it s now chinese but they got er pause dur short two erm pause dur short two systems one country er they got sovereignty over it
1	right
1	it s like er pause dur short erm territories you know like france has got monaco and and er pause dur short andorra pause dur short which they share with spain but erm but it s it is chinese the chinese government have got the er the ultimate say over everything pause dur short and erm pause dur short they put the kibosh on that er pause dur short that democracy movement that that started last year when they had riots
1	yes pause dur short right
1	er i was surprised to be honest that the that the chinese government let them pause dur short go as far as they did
1	right
1	but now they they sort of rode out the they re very clever the chinese er government and er they rather than clamp down on it really harshly which a lot of people including myself were expecting pause dur short er they let it ride and now have bought in when er all the the hoo ha and the world attention s not on it they re pause dur short er making sure restrictions making sure they you know they don t do it again pause dur short so er pause dur short but finding work down there wouldn t be wouldn t be possible pause dur short because they ve got the same pause dur short restrictions about trunc si trunc being sixty five there pause dur short as they have pause dur short in
1	china
1	in erm
1	the mainland
1	in trunc chi trunc in mainland china yeah and er most of asia south east asia all the same malaysia indonesia pause dur short thailand pause dur short it s all the same
1	they probably think they re helping people vocal desc laugh
1	sixty five that s it
1	ah dear dear dear pause dur short but so how did he give you hope
1	well thinking you know if he s got it maybe i could get it pause dur short if i i ve gotta contact him pause dur short erm again erm find out exactly how he did it pause dur short erm pause dur long so pause dur short that s two things i can try pause dur short mm pause dur short yeah
1	yeah pause dur short what and trunc the trunc then if you then you d move back into mainland china
1	well you can just go down there and try and get the visa
1	yeah
1	come back pause dur long
1	do you think you d run into that age thing again though

1	yeah pause dur short i er pause dur short saved a girl from from serious sexual assault in a pause dur short when i was in paris with my girlfriend and er we were at the arc de triomph on new year s eve
1	and you decided against it vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short yeah but no she she was dragged to the ground by pause dur short half a dozen at least probably more arabs dragged this single woman to the ground
1	oh my god
1	were groping her putting their hands up her skirt you know she she was just doing nothing and i just waded into them
1	yeah pause dur short mm well done
1	well i didn t hit anyone pause dur short i just said get off her pause dur short helped her up and said you go and stand with us
1	mm well done
1	but you know a respectable woman she was you know shocked she was really frightened
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short the thing is when trunc peo trunc often when people talk about er interracial problems like well there are here and pause dur short but even more so france it s er it s to outsiders it might sound racist pause dur short but pause dur short when you live there and see on a daily basis what happens erm it s it s another thing pause dur long
1	what what what things do you remember seeing when you were there that the arabs
1	well if you re going to score some dope it s going to be from an arab
1	right
1	beurre foreign trunc tran trunc literally used to mean butter right but now the butters vocal desc laugh pause dur short but
1	why do they call them that
1	i don t know i don t know but erm ah there are big problems in especially in paris er with all the er the arabs and the blacks pause dur short er they live in ghettos and er the inner cities are terrible places
1	are they
1	oh yeah no go areas some of them
1	wow
1	yeah pause dur short and er
1	wow it s that bad
1	yeah pause dur short oh yeah yeah pause dur short it really is pause dur short well remember that that story i told you about when we were walking along the prom pause dur short in nice about i remember watching er pause dur short the american bombers go ahead when the first iraqi war opened you know and i told you that er i saw a queue trunc out trunc outside the arms shop pause dur short you know people would
1	yeah yeah
1	cos of the the whites were really scared that it was gonna kick off pause dur short unclear but unclear
1	well it s only the other side of the mediterranean isn t it vocal desc laugh
1	well yeah
1	it s not far away
1	but er but it didn t materialise pause dur short erm
1	no
1	but er there is you know this fear in france is trunc di trunc really a divided country pause dur short when that erm charlie hebdo thing happened
1	yeah
1	that radicalised a lot of people
1	what
1	exodus from france so french citizens pause dur short erm
1	where did they chose to go
1	well london s a favourite spot but also
1	really
1	yeah
1	what for parisians
1	yeah they re there are many more er french leaving er france than ever before pause dur short and er
1	good god
1	oh yeah
1	it s like the end of the roman empire isn t it vocal desc laugh
1	well
1	the fall of the roman empire
1	it and especially jewish families i know you you don t have much sympathy for them but er they
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they they er they re really fearing er pause dur short well what they can see as pause dur short inevitable that er there s tax on synagogues and and jewish schools and things you know
1	oh i see yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	and there are there are armed soldiers outside all these places now
1	oh my goodness
1	you don t remember we see those armed guys up above the station
1	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah pause dur short yeah
1	they re everywhere pause dur short so pause dur short doesn t bode well does it when you ve got paramilitary and military erm forces er pause dur short on more or less permanent guard outside jewish places
1	places
1	smacks of you know pre war germany doesn t it
1	vocal desc misc well
1	so they re they got record immigration to trunc ba trunc trunc ba trunc they re going to er israel i think yeah pause dur short but erm pause dur short but i was talking to those french girls you don t remember i went out pause dur short had a one evening a few a month or so ago
1	yes
1	and they you know they don t they don t know the answer either pause dur short well it s gonna happen they said themselves you know they they they re always wary about going out pause dur short being attacked
1	by arabs
1	mm pause dur short mainly
1	wow
1	yeah pause dur short not only but i think that s a you know the main cause and er well we spoke about this charlie hebdo thing and pause dur short erm pause dur short they just said well you know the the basic question wasn t it the the the moral trunc philosoph trunc philosophical questions about er whether they were pause dur short right or wrong to publish those things that that instigated the attacks pause dur short whether either in a democracy that er one of the oldest in the world pause dur short i don t know if it s the oldest pause dur short but
1	i thoughts the greeks
1	well it wasn t a true democracy as such it was only you had to be a citizen didn t you and they had slaves and
1	oh i see yeah
1	so erm whether you should have the right to pause dur short say something pause dur short negative about somebody but pause dur short is it vocal desc sigh on the other hand do you have the right to insult something or somebody is considered sacred pause dur short like mohammed okay pause dur short so that s the the thing that that started it wasn t it when they they and er pause dur short and you saw the americans they they what happened there
1	i think you have to respect people pause dur short have respect for people
1	yeah but the the the question is should on one hand pause dur short in a democracy where you ve got the right to say what you think about something pause dur short should that be pause dur short your pause dur short er right to do so pause dur short but on the other hand
1	by thinking unclear
1	it it would you be pause dur short could you be accused of incitement to riot
1	you could be accused of that pause dur short quite probably but there again there are many good muslims who didn t
1	sure
1	riot about it who who erm who just said well that s you know i don t even want to know about it you know and i forgive them
1	well i think most muslims do take that
1	i think most muslims do take that line
1	yeah but
1	erm
1	we only hear about the minority don t we the extremists
1	i can trunc st trunc i can show you i can show you websites on there pause dur short of jews saying things from i m glad we murdered your christ your jesus we i i promise you i can show you websites and they re not by as a matter of fact these are jews pause dur short to things on television mocking christianity mocking people s belief in swearing and all this on jewish television so i don t er pause dur short you know i i er i felt it before as a christian and even though i m not pause dur short i don t go to church often but pause dur short it offends me pause dur short it does offend me very much pause dur short you know
1	it s a very delicate line this because it it carries on over to erm pause dur short er how what you you consider is necessary to be a good er pause dur short devotee of a certain religion like for example head gear headwear pause dur short not only includes in the arab veil for women
1	catholic nuns
1	well yeah yeah and but trunc e trunc the the french government the parliament they they they ruled that erm they er pause dur short they can t wear it er erm
1	the hijab
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	so pause dur short when pause dur short trunc s trunc again sikhs you know should pause dur short why why shouldn t sikhs have their turbans and
1	well quite it s what makes enriches the world isn t it
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	i think the dangerous thing is when you start putting your stuff on other people as muslims would put their stuff christians put their stuff
1	mm pause dur short i think the you you it makes sense that pause dur short countries like britain and france have to er pause dur short change with the times and while on the one hand france is a secular state and has this rigid partition between er the clergy and the government
1	clergy and state
1	the state yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short well there s that er i think er that they they should er be more flexible er pause dur short because most of these immigrants they re not gonna go away pause dur short so france like britain is a multicultural country and pause dur short you can t expect to live in the past
1	no pause dur short well i i m quite sure quite probably years ago people were multicultural you know and people all over different religions and different er ethnicities were living all over the world weren t there
1	well they were pause dur short they were
1	you know here and
1	but it s so much more intensified isn t it these days pause dur short with the just the numbers
1	well i saw something the other day it said oh in they were doing a story on rome and it said in pause dur short whenever it was twelve fifty or whenever pause dur short er pause dur short there were more people living in rome than there are today vocal desc laugh
1	really
1	so and i suspect the same is true pause dur short i know certainly of edinburgh pause dur short there were probably more people living in edinburgh for certainly and if you look at it at at everything you ll probably find there were more people living in london because people you know that little cottage i had in
1	anon type place
1	anon type place yeah i mean there were four families living in there
1	good lord
1	four families
1	well i think the numbers are certainly they used to be around one or two million for a long time didn t they wasn t it and then i seem to remember when we were kids that from geography lessons the population of london was about six to eight million something like that i think it s maybe a lot more now
1	yeah but when you when you look where at that area the city of london that once was unclear the people living in that area then say six million or whatever and now in that square mile there are probably less people living in that square trunc me trunc square mile than there were then
1	mm
1	although the city s pause dur short expanded the pause dur short you know people live in expect to live in in trunc fl trunc in a flat don t they in a small flat pause dur short with with services but er you know pause dur short but i was reading a a book it was anon nametype f type name s i think i ve given it back to her but it was erm a it was a labour mp wrote it
1	mm
1	i i think it was i think it was a guy called alan clark or john clark pause dur short and he described how he lived in the fifties with his mother and father in this erm pause dur short building that s in this part of london that s probably now pulled down pause dur short but they in one room they had one room upstairs oh oh no they had two rooms and there were four of them and like two rooms upstairs in this house and the loo was a bucket and they had to take the bucket down to the road it was just appallingly
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short it was poverty it was grinding poverty
1	most of it just got thrown out the window think didn t it vocal desc laugh
1	yeah well it used didn t it
1	yeah
1	god pause dur short guard a loo
1	i remember pause dur short when er i used to stay in anon nametype f type name s place it was behind where we used to live in anon type place terrace

0	thank you for the pancakes
1	it on pause dur short okay pause dur short well i was born in england pause dur short in a little country market town called anon type place in anon type place in nineteen thirty seven pause dur short and pause dur short i was very lucky because i was extremely loved and cared for pause dur short for the first eighteen months of my life pause dur short and pause dur short i think that made a big difference to me because my sister was less lucky and was born pause dur short in february pause dur short in nineteen thirty nine pause dur short and our dad was in the ta and he was called up very very quickly in fact before the outbreak of war because it was clear that war was probably coming and pause dur short so pause dur short we had to learn pause dur short trunc v trunc pause dur short really to live without our dad pause dur short do you want to check it
1	ah it s okay it s okay
1	no it s okay pause dur short well erm vocal desc misc pause dur short i was looked after brilliantly by mother for the first three years pause dur short as far as i was concerned it was lovely having mum all to myself but pause dur short it wasn t of course so easy for her pause dur short trying to manage two very young children pause dur short by herself pause dur short my dad was in the yeomanry pause dur short er the anon type place and anon type place yeomanry and incredibly in nineteen thirty nine he went to war with a horse isn t that extraordinary
1	really
1	yes pause dur short it was a horse called bess and
1	gosh
1	off they went with erm pause dur short er to the middle east pause dur short with horses pause dur short and of course the poor horses were totally pause dur short hopeless against tanks and what very rapidly happened was that the horses it was recognised that the horses were pause dur short not useful and pause dur short a great many of them had to be put down and a lot of them erm actually never got there because horses apparently can t be sick and the weather was terrible and so the horses that got seasick died
1	vocal desc misc oh
1	so they had really horrible experience pause dur short but back in anon type place in anon type place pause dur short mum made friends with the other mothers of erm little children who were bank wives my father worked in lloyds bank in peace time and pause dur short er it just so happened that pause dur short my pause dur short aunt who wasn t really an aunt who lived down the road pause dur short erm pause dur short was married to a bank man also in lloyds and he turned out to be pause dur short absolutely incapable of coping with pause dur short military life pause dur short he was actually in the air rorce but he couldn t hack it and had a nervous breakdown and pause dur short erm it was terribly disgraceful and there was much whispering going on in corners between aunt anon nametype f type name and mother erm pause dur short but it was recognised that eventually that he pause dur short he wasn t skiving he just couldn t cope and he went back to the bank so that was really lucky for me because i d got a father substitute so there again he pause dur short he selected me i was a very fanciful imaginative child so i got pause dur short a a pause dur short surrogate dad but anon nametype f type name hadn t anon nametype f type name was younger and a different child and she was tremendously devoted to mother pause dur short and mother made it a lot of trunc f trunc fun for us she wasn t actually pause dur short feeling a great sense of pause dur short of fun erm but she knew how to make life fun for us pause dur short and of course there was rationing but mother was very good at getting rabbits pause dur short she used to get rabbits from anon nametype m type name pause dur short anon nametype m type name went rabbiting pause dur short with the marquess of bath pause dur short on the anon type place estate and pause dur short he was he would trunc c trunc have all sorts of rabbits under the counter of his fish shop pause dur short and mother was one of his favourites pause dur short mother had the most wonderful red hair she was absolutely gorgeous and she was very good at getting the rabbits
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and she used them for dual purpose because pause dur short she was pause dur short very keen on the red cross she d trunc d trunc joined the red cross and aunt anon nametype f type name looked after us aunt anon nametype f type name didn t have any children and she looked after us on pause dur short the days that mother went to the red cross and when mother had to practise dissection she practised on the rabbits because of course they came in their skin
1	mm mm
1	and so mother would skin them and investigate their innards and learn all about rabbit interiors even if she wasn t too sure about human interiors and she loved the red cross pause dur short and she used to take us for walks every day and she knew where the periwinkles grew and she knew pause dur short er we would go to pause dur short er the pause dur short erm place called woodlands which was on the anon type place estate where there were marvellous bluebells and she knew that if we climbed up pause dur short on to the railway embankment we could get white violets pause dur short there were er mauve violets wood violets in the woods ah woodlands pause dur short but for white violets we needed to go pause dur short up on to the railway embankment pause dur short which was not allowed but mother was very good at deciding that we could disobey the rules if we were with her vocal desc misc pause dur short and she also took us to get snowdrops pause dur short in at anon type place which was another big country estate i guess you could get access to these places more easily probably in wartime vocal desc misc and she knew about spindleberries and she knew where there was a spindleberry tree pause dur short so pause dur short she was just a lot of fun really even though there weren t many toys about and from the post office she would buy a colouring book pause dur short and we had one i remember with birds in and we could choose a picture every day pause dur short and pause dur short colour it pause dur short and choosing was big business very special occasion pause dur short but pause dur short when we had nearly finished the book she would say well now you can do trunc any trunc you can do all of them that s alright you can just you can do one and then you can do another if you want to and then there was a moment of very great excitement and then suddenly it wasn t exciting at all it was very boring because it was pause dur short we could we could have anyone so we didn t want any of them we were tired of colouring and it was all spoiled pause dur short and she taught us how to make raffia mats and she taught us how to make woollen balls pause dur short and pause dur short she made our clothes and that was terribly tiresome we didn t have many clothes pause dur short but pause dur short erm i had an aunt who knitted this was a real aunt my mother s younger sister and she knitted fair isle sweaters and we had kilts to go with those pause dur short and they were just beautiful so we were very impressed with those but the making of the kilts was tiresome because you had to stand up on a little tuffy pause dur short and have pause dur short pins stuck into you and that was very tiresome pause dur short and she would make dresses for us pause dur short and again anon nametype f type name had a harder time than i did because we were dressed alike but pause dur short she used to say pause dur short that pause dur short doing the first one was more fun and she always did the first one for me and then anon nametype f type name got the second one and by the time she did the second one she was bit less she was a bit tired of it so anon nametype f type name got the short straw again vocal desc misc pause dur short and pause dur short dad sent things pause dur short dad sent pause dur short first of all ribbon pause dur short er blue ribbon for me and a pink ribbon for anon nametype f type name and this came from i don t know where but the ribbon arrived and anon nametype f type name couldn t remember him i could remember him pause dur short erm but i didn t know what you did with the ribbon and mother had an idea and she gave us pause dur short erm pieces of bamboo pause dur short and we tied the ribbon on well i suppose she tied the ribbon on cos i don t think we would ve been able to do pause dur short bows but she tied the ribbon in a bow and then they were wands so we could wave them we could do all sorts of magic that was wonderful and then dad sent pause dur short little filigree pause dur short silver pause dur short brooches they were butterflies and a big butterfly ours were quite little and a big butterfly for mother vocal desc misc and then most wonderful of all he sent pause dur short a beautiful blouse for mother which was pause dur short erm a sort of erm natural colour with cream trunc em trunc erm no it was green embroidery trunc moth trunc mother with her beautiful erm pause dur short vocal desc misc red hair and green eyes looked marvellous in green and she had a black suit and she would wear this lovely blouse erm with the green embroidery round the neck erm with her black suit and there were party dresses for anon nametype f type name and for me pause dur short and i felt very sorry for anon nametype f type name because anon nametype f type name s was pause dur short er red embroidery on pause dur short er white silk and mine was on a sort of cheesecloth pause dur short which was a natural colour and it was pause dur short marvellous rainbow colours the embroidery i thought mine was to die for i felt so beautiful pause dur short but when i look back on it i think probably anon nametype f type name s was a great deal more subtle and more attractive vocal desc misc pause dur short so we had our party dresses and we would put our pause dur short vocal desc misc pause dur short butterflies on our dresses pause dur short and we felt the bee s knees and we even pause dur short even in wartime pause dur short went very occasionally to birthday parties pause dur short but of course not very often vocal desc misc pause dur short and erm vocal desc misc pause dur short trunc n trunc we we had a little trip to anon type place i suppose mum wanted to send photographs of us to dad and we had polyphotos taken pause dur short and polyphotos pause dur short were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little square photographs pause dur short and erm and then you selected from all these masses and masses and masses and one was blown up and framed and was the special one the chosen one vocal desc misc so erm i don t know exactly what was sent but we trunc h trunc i remember going to have these polyphotos taken in all our finery and er feeling very very grand pause dur short but then in nineteen forty three on about february the eighth when pause dur short anon nametype f type name was just three pause dur short there was a fire and of course you know all about pause dur short that
1	yes
1	erm mother pause dur short erm was pause dur short it was the early morning we were in mother s bedroom and she had a gas fire against the wall and she put the fire on she got a dressing gown on and pause dur short erm pause dur short it i don t know how it happened but the dressing gown caught fire
1	vocal desc misc ah
1	and pause dur short er trunc sh trunc anon nametype f type name and i were in mother s bed pause dur short and pause dur short i i just have a trunc s trunc blurred memory of it i can t remember it clearly pause dur short but there were flames and flames and and pause dur short it was all horrible and pause dur short mother wrapped herself up in something which was it seemed as it she was shutting the trunc f trunc flames on herself but it was just the right
1	mm
1	thing do actually and she knew because of the red cross she d learnt erm first aid and basic pause dur short er erm pause dur short response to pause dur short flood and water and and er trunc f trunc fire and erm she knew that that was what you had to do and she did it pause dur short so pause dur short i can t remember pause dur short what happened next really pause dur short erm pause dur short i know mother always banged on the wall pause dur short cos we didn t have a telephone pause dur short but she could get help pause dur short from pause dur short erm mrs pause dur short what was she called pause dur short ah mrs anon nametype n type name mrs anon nametype f type name next door mrs anon nametype f type name was pause dur short erm pause dur short a trunc b trunc queen bee of the pause dur short wrvs or something she was a very important person anyway in the local pause dur short hierarchy pause dur short and mrs anon nametype f type name was a great friend to mother and she turned up and i m sure sorted out getting the doctor and the ambulance and all the rest of it pause dur short so mother went to hospital and pause dur short er we had fallen out of paradise pause dur short and i can remember all this activity pause dur short and standing at the bottom of the stairs saying we haven t had our porridge pause dur short and the grown ups being very cross because i d said that and i didn t understand why i had no idea really what had happened pause dur short and i stayed at home granny and grandpa arrived pause dur short and granny had had they had had ten children and were completely incapable of coping with pause dur short us pause dur short they were pause dur short just not up to it pause dur short to trunc ch trunc small children and pause dur short erm pause dur short i had just started pause dur short school pause dur short erm or i was just about to start school i can t remember pause dur short but that was very very fortunate trunc m trunc oh yes mother remembered that she was making my pause dur short buttercup coloured school blouses pause dur short at i suppose ready for the next term pause dur short erm when this pause dur short accident happened pause dur short and pause dur short er first of all they thought she d die she had third degree burns pause dur short and then they kept her alive somehow or other and pause dur short that was really really really lucky because pause dur short they had just discovered pause dur short erm really i think they were only being done for service men but they d just discovered how to do
1	mm
1	erm grafts and vocal desc misc pause dur short erm my father pause dur short couldn t get home
1	oh
1	because was rather a lot going on pause dur short in the war and i don t think you could just pause dur short erm come home because you felt it would be a good idea pause dur short erm pause dur short in trunc nin trunc in early nineteen forty three but he did get home before the end of the war and when he got home he did pause dur short get mother pause dur short to pause dur short er to see erm pause dur short anon nametype m type name
1	oh yes
1	so she was jolly lucky really and he pause dur short had by this time trained some other people to do what he was doing and pause dur short one of them was always known he was never ever i never discovered what his christian name was he was mr anon nametype n type name and as far as mother was concerned he was god
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so god did when she eventually came to have her grafts they were done by god
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but erm pause dur short they they were many and some were successful and some were not and pause dur short redheads have very thin skin so she wasn t designed pause dur short for grafting really anyway and erm pause dur short it took a trunc l trunc it was she had her last pause dur short operation pause dur short in the early nineteen fifties so it was a long long slow business pause dur short but for anon nametype f type name and me it was pretty miserable have we done enough do you think
1	well let s have a look erm pause dur short you you could pause dur short i mean you you ve done nineteen minutes at the moment do you want to go on for half an hour or not
1	erm
1	well i ll ask you some questions shall i
1	okay
1	how about that because otherwise it s all a bit one trunc sid trunc pause dur short erm so erm when she had her skin graft operations erm no what i wanted to ask you was was her face burnt at all
1	no
1	oh thank goodness for that
1	no pause dur short she
1	and her neck alright
1	no her neck was fine
1	it was
1	it was her
1	unclear legs unclear
1	legs and her bottom
1	yeah yeah by the fire
1	that were burned pause dur short yes
1	yes the fire pause dur short mm mm
1	the trunc f trunc it was the the trunc th trunc the erm er er erm i suppose i don t know what material the dressing gown was
1	right
1	but it was probably something very flammable
1	right okay
1	i i just simply don t know
1	no no i know erm the erm pause dur short er pause dur short and also erm were they sort of really aware of erm pause dur short hydration at that time you know because people suffer from hypovolemic shock because they lose so much fluid from their burns
1	mm
1	and that s the first thing that kills people off pause dur short and they trunc ha trunc did she have do you do you remember seeing her with drips in her arm or drips hanging off
1	i don t pause dur short i don t think
1	or with clear fluid
1	she said people would come to her and
1	mm
1	say to her pause dur short erm you must worry all the time about the children and she said pause dur short er later i never thought about the children
1	right
1	i was er i was in such horrendous pain
1	yeah unclear horrendous unclear pain yeah
1	i didn t think about
1	no
1	anything except
1	no
1	how long i could endure this and i just wanted to die
1	mm
1	and she said erm pause dur short that pause dur short trunc th trunc there was trunc u trunc trunc u trunc er when she got pause dur short first to erm the pause dur short doctor who erm pause dur short who did the grafts that she was pause dur short erm he was very shocked and he said what on earth has been happening and she said pause dur short they kept me alive she thought the trunc co trunc little cottage hospital
1	yes
1	in anon type place
1	right
1	was wonderful
1	right
1	because they had
1	yes
1	kept her going
1	yeah
1	and pause dur short trunc th trunc she also said that when she d first come home pause dur short she realised she couldn t cope with us
1	right
1	at all
1	yes
1	and pause dur short that she had pause dur short had trunc tr trunc come downstairs to put her head in the gas oven
1	oh
1	in the night and she had thought about us
1	oh
1	she had seen us asleep and she thought i can t leave them so in a
1	right
1	way we did
1	keep her there
1	we did keep here there
1	yeah
1	but we got sent to a ghastly boarding school i can t tell you how awful vocal desc laugh
1	yes i i was just going to ask you where did you go in all this
1	well erm pause dur short we pause dur short anon nametype f type name went to stay with pause dur short an pause dur short aunt pause dur short who was not sympathetic to small children at all
1	oh dear
1	and er who got somebody in from the village to look after her pause dur short but she while she was with the aunt erm pause dur short she was just a little slip of a thing and the aunt had a fourteen year old son
1	oh dear
1	and he was mowing pause dur short the lawn one afternoon and anon nametype f type name was trying to help him pause dur short and pause dur short he cut the index finger of her right hand off with the mowing machine
1	oh
1	and of course in those days nobody ever thought that it might be stitched back on again or anything like that unclear didn t know if unclear it could possibly have been done but it certainly wasn t
1	no no
1	and so pause dur short anon nametype f type name has no index finger on her right hand she s got a little stump
1	oh gosh and pause dur short an index finger is so vital isn t it
1	i know pause dur short yes
1	it s really vital
1	oh trunc sh trunc and and at the boarding school of course we both began wetting the bed immediately
1	yeah
1	it was run by a ghastly sadistic woman
1	oh no
1	who erm was would beat anon nametype f type name regularly for because she she was trouble as far as vocal desc laugh she was just desperately unhappy and
1	yes
1	and and she was pause dur short such a little tiny tot pause dur short erm pause dur short i was there was there from six until eight but anon nametype f type name was there from four until six
1	vocal desc misc oh
1	so pause dur short that was
1	right pause dur short yes pause dur short yes
1	really really hard
1	it was hard
1	yes
1	goodness
1	and anon nametype f type name i think has pause dur short has never entirely recovered pause dur short but pause dur short i pause dur short think i was very lucky because as far as i was concerned life was so much better forever afterwards
1	yes yes
1	vocal desc laugh and i was just grateful
1	yeah
1	once we got once the war was over
1	yes
1	and we were together again
1	yeah exactly
1	my dad survived the war
1	yes
1	yes
1	good and erm and so you were away so you got back then your mother had recovered sufficiently then to be
1	my mother was
1	with you
1	a goer my mother er was impossible really she was a marvellous mother and she had terrific pause dur short looks and flair and go
1	mm
1	and nothing stopped her pause dur short and pause dur short she had three more children after the war
1	really
1	and pause dur short er a miscarriage and then pause dur short a legal abortion
1	right
1	because pause dur short well a legal termination i suppose it would ve been called
1	yes
1	erm pause dur short but erm pause dur short she she started another baby erm i should think it would be about nineteen fifty two and that would ve been six of us pause dur short and pause dur short er the doctor said you can t do this erm and mother said well i m going to and pause dur short er she reported later on that he said well i think it s better to have five children with a mother than six children without
1	yes
1	and
1	exactly
1	that persuaded her
1	yes
1	so she did pause dur short but pause dur short she never quite got over it really she just she was a can do person vocal desc laugh
1	yes
1	to an absurd extent vocal desc laugh
1	exactly
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	well the thing about having a near death experience is it makes you for a while for a while must be five years pause dur short it makes you do things rather in a more erm erratic way than you would trunc poss trunc you re almost celebrating the fact that you re alive and i expect that s what she was doing
1	yes
1	i think she might ve done but she was always pause dur short er i mean the other thing that i d missed out
1	yes
1	is that she had a love affair in the war
1	oh did she
1	yes erm obviously it was before the burns
1	yes
1	erm and it was somebody who came back erm pause dur short with on with the erm vocal desc misc pause dur short dunkirk
1	oh yes
1	mm
1	little boats pause dur short and who was here until pause dur short nineteen forty four
1	right
1	and pause dur short er my father who was a very very sane sensible nice man erm she had married really because she was a wild child and pause dur short all her family thought it would be pause dur short that he was a very good man and
1	yes
1	he would calm her down and quieten her
1	oh yes pause dur short mm mm
1	so she did it to keep everybody else quiet
1	mm
1	but pause dur short it wasn t a great love affair pause dur short and they certainly had trouble pause dur short getting together again after the war but pause dur short i think because probably because of mother s big romance pause dur short erm pause dur short trunc th trunc it she was able to to do it he was married anyway the romance and pause dur short had a child pause dur short so they agreed between them that they could not break up these all these pause dur short situations and trunc th trunc just out of selfishness so i think they would ve decided that anyway pause dur short but erm
1	the contrast between you having your er wonderful er early childhood and then everything changing after your mother s accident erm is very stark isn t it
1	it is but i had pause dur short i trunc h trunc suppose i was hugely lucky because pause dur short i had pause dur short a bank of memories
1	yes
1	and anon nametype f type name s bank wasn t nearly as full as mine
1	no
1	and i know that one of the ways i survived pause dur short at boarding school pause dur short was pause dur short erm pause dur short i would i would trunc s trunc go off by myself and dig about in a little patch of pretend garden
1	mm
1	and pause dur short i would remember my mother in particular attitudes and i would just i would have an idea of
1	mm
1	her and i could remember my dad
1	yes yes
1	but anon nametype f type name couldn t remember dad
1	no
1	and pause dur short her trunc sh trunc er she felt this sort of huge need of mother pause dur short but she didn t pause dur short she wasn t old enough pause dur short or sort of pause dur short or the same sort of child so that she
1	no
1	couldn t do that
1	no no
1	and her trunc s trunc again she oh dear it goes on erm pause dur short she had a gang that was her system she she she found a little gang and they were led by pause dur short a man what was his trunc n trunc a boy what was his name oh i can t remember his name pause dur short but erm he was a i can see his face he was a big boy pause dur short anon nametype n type name that s right their surname was anon nametype n type name pause dur short anon nametype m type name that s it and anon nametype m type name was i suppose about twelve he trunc w trunc seemed a very big boy to me
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm pause dur short trunc u trunc was the leader of the gang
1	right
1	and anon nametype f type name was the littlest person
1	right
1	and she was the trunc s trunc and she adored him pause dur short and pause dur short he was killed on a bicycle
1	oh pause dur short no
1	in the pause dur short unclear vocation unclear which fortunately was in the holiday not term time
1	right
1	erm i don t think we would ve had pause dur short bicycles at boarding school pause dur short but erm pause dur short trunc u trunc trunc u trunc she came back he s got a sister anon nametype f type name pause dur short and anon nametype f type name was alright but pause dur short anon nametype m type name was gone and i think pause dur short that mattered a great deal to her
1	yes yes
1	i can remember that being very shocked that somebody pause dur short little could die
1	yes yes exactly
1	but i m sure compared with what was going on in europe at the time it was all pause dur short very small unclear deal unclear
1	yes pause dur short well absolutely but
1	yes
1	she had she she didn t remember your father
1	no
1	your mother pause dur short went suddenly was taken away
1	trunc s trunc well she was there and then she was not there
1	yeah pause dur short and
1	mm
1	erm and then trunc u trunc trunc u trunc somebody who she attached herself
1	yes
1	onto really
1	yes
1	to feel like she was almost in the gang was
1	yes
1	part of a family group
1	yes
1	and then that was taken away well she was so lucky to have you still
1	well she s pause dur short she and i speak every day on the telephone
1	do you yeah
1	every morning pause dur short and pause dur short erm pause dur short she pause dur short certainly has been very important to me
1	yes
1	and pause dur short she is pause dur short er i would say a very interesting individual rather eccentric but
1	yes
1	erm pause dur short happy person
1	yes pause dur short now
1	now pause dur short but she s had pause dur short a hard difficult life
1	yeah
1	a
1	yeah
1	really really difficult life
1	because a a difficult childhood can often trunc r trunc trunc r trunc result in patterns of behaviour
1	mm
1	and patterns of behaviour extend they re the learned patterns of behaviour trunc whe trunc whether they re as shakespeare would say some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them
1	mm
1	it s nobody s fault pause dur short but these erm patterns of behaviour seem to permeate throughout life
1	oh they do
1	and
1	yes
1	erm you know and it all starts with childhood always that s where it s learned
1	yes
1	well most of the learning is done in childhood isn t it
1	well i think so
1	yes
1	i think so
1	yeah
1	yes
1	so erm pause dur short so there you go erm pause dur short right well we can end it there erm it s thirty two minutes ten seconds

1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short oh we do have a laugh don t we
1	i know i know pause dur short oh it s so nice meeting a woman just nice woman even if she was with a boyfriend
1	well i could put a wig on and put some lipstick on if that ll help
1	yeah vocal desc laugh yeah she was a councillor i said what trunc d trunc er do trunc y trunc if it s not a rude question what is it you do erm anon nametype f type name she said i m a councillor i said what for the local council she and she said no i m a private counsellor you know er i counsel people on their problems i went oh right
1	oh pause dur short like a
1	and
1	psychiatrist almost
1	erm
1	therapy
1	well counselling is a something a skill that we all had once and we ve lost we gave it away due to manners and civility and i mean i still think you need to have manners because it s in the society and they re all different according to different societies
1	absolutely
1	erm but pause dur short we gave a lot through religion we gave away erm earth religions which erm pause dur short er is interesting i go to celebrations on solstices quite often
1	uhu
1	and erm that s interesting to to look into i i i find that fascinating and then we the pause dur short the other thing we gave we gave that away to er domination of religion which is controlled spiritual philosophy pause dur short and counselling i think we gave away to pause dur short it was robbed from us it was we were we re not taught it in school we should be taught it in school i think
1	yeah
1	we should be taught how to counsel each other
1	do you think kids could handle it though
1	yes i think they re the they know it s they know it s the right way trunc i trunc trunc i trunc impulsively cos it is the right way
1	instinctively
1	instinctively yes pause dur short what s the difference between an impulse and an instinct
1	impulse is an immediate reaction
1	right pause dur short so it s a
1	and
1	reaction
1	yeah
1	right
1	i mean and and i trunc g trunc those things you see when you checkout at the supermarket the they re called impulse purchasing
1	yes
1	and you do it on the spur of the moment
1	of course
1	it s not pre planned
1	oh pause dur short i see
1	you do something on impulse you do it oh i fancy that i ll do it
1	yeah
1	i mean instinct is something that erm is intrinsic i think in us that probably is passed down through our dna somehow pause dur short like animal instinct
1	yes
1	when a an animal is born very often or depending on the species of course it can get up and start walking immediately
1	yes
1	by instinct
1	they say a lot of it was well someone said to me once and i tend to agree with them and it may be a column i m sure there have been loads of millions of books written on it but breakdowns trunc esse trunc essentially occur in human beings when they re told and and er when they re told that if they behave in a certain way their life will work for them get a job be responsible stand up for your country do all these things erm and life will pause dur short be alright
1	mm
1	vocal desc cough and they get to midlife and they realise that their life isn t working and they ve pause dur short forgotten the spiritual aspect of their life you know their spirit their spirit is something that is within them and wants to do things and pause dur short er is is basically a joyful thing spirit s a joyful thing it s the joy within us the spirit of man it s not a not a not a something outside of us it s something trunc wi trunc i think it is with er with a yeah trunc th trunc spirit of god i think is everywhere we ve just got to open ourselves to it erm and many religions trunc pra trunc trunc pre trunc preach that or or teach that and pause dur short but i think the way that they cloak it all is in mystery and superstition and er
1	dogma
1	dogma and er all these bloody things yeah but the trunc ma trunc man or woman gets to a point in their lives especially in men with the work ethic they get to the trunc wor trunc a point in their lives where they say my life isn t working and i m doing but i m doing all the right things that society says is the way to go and it s not we we re we re driven by market forces and we re driven by the fact that we have to rent a house from the landlord or buy a house at er a great proportion of our wage robbing us essentially of time because money is time and time is money pause dur short we change our we exchange our time on this earth for money pause dur short they re units of time and pause dur short erm
1	so where did you think in that pause dur short lies the the clich of midlife crisis
1	er well i think a man gets to a time when pause dur short basically he should have had more fun i think you know and er pause dur short it happens i suspect generally forties fifties
1	mm
1	and er pause dur short it s just the time that it happens it happens in younger erm people who are in their twenties you know when they re pause dur short when they re working against themselves really they re they re the the deeper psyche they re on their subconscious or unconscious mind subconscious mind they re pause dur short er trunc m trunc part of them i don t know all the parts the ego the id the subconscious the conscious the that s all parts of the mind but pause dur short part of the human being that they re restricting through living their lives in a particular way er through compromise erm er just isn t being fed isn t being nurtured it s been put on the backburner and all the time we say i ll go on holiday next year i ll do this later in my life i when i m got enough money to do it
1	mm
1	i ll do this then and er and the forces that be or the way that things go say that money is always the factor you know pause dur short kids naturally look for parties and places to dance and enjoy and rejoice and pause dur short the police go and stop these parties they say oh drugs are involved yeah well you know traditionally drugs have always been involved in parties vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh from the year dot so erm pause dur short er
1	but it s being separated isn t it from er his er mystical element to just getting out of your mind but without any specific purpose other than to get out of your mind vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	i was thinking in particular remember carlos castaneda s books pause dur short like when he s tripping on peyote
1	oh right er what was the book called pause dur long
1	oh i think he did several i can t remember
1	yes
1	a particular one at the moment pause dur short i mean the main character s called carlos or something unclear but it s it s set in i think it was set in mexico or texas or somewhere like that pause dur short and it was about his mystical experiences under the the influence of this drug pause dur long mm pause dur short well at least the trunc leg trunc legislation has started to change in a lot of places pause dur short isn t it trunc be trunc
1	yeah like but
1	mm better late than never
1	yeah but again it s been by capitalists to make money if you look all all the all the erm it s the way that the americans have now legalised cannabis a you ve got to have a medical condition to be able to warrant your possession of it and usage of it
1	mm
1	and probably b growing it is still illegal so
1	yeah
1	again they they they again the er the means of production
1	they wanna control the means of production yeah
1	has been taken away from the workers you know
1	mm
1	as everything you trunc kn trunc er that s being done er you could say it s from the use of herbicides where we could go er get gather herbs in the countryside to the erm pause dur short introduction of myxomatosis the and the countryman s food in the rabbit has now been poisoned so there s very few ways that you the the the common land that you could farm and feed your animals on or even build a house on under trunc cir trunc circumstances has been taken away from us pause dur short and so er er they give clever reasons for it all but essentially erm it s they re all ways that have either intentionally or unintentionally taken away free food free living from
1	yeah
1	from people pause dur short erm pause dur short it s it s all part of a plan that we are enslaved totally
1	vocal desc sigh
1	we have to pay for everything even water
1	yeah
1	and this is the big thing going on in third world countries now that er people like coca cola are moving their plants to india where they have only a limited amount of water and the ground water now is polluted by what coca cola does and the products that coca cola make instead of being drunk but the local trunc po trunc population and passed through their bodies and put back in the ground it that doesn t happen in that area so it even depletes the groundwater more erm so er and the coca cola is trunc so trunc sold hundreds of miles or thousands of miles away so er the it goes on without the regard of the trunc indivi trunc vidual with er with rights you know pause dur long you know pause dur short continually there are people in this world working out ways of how to charge people for things how they can make money out of everything charge for every single thing and that erm and that s not right when we re born onto this planet we re born with rights that er you know it s it s your world it s no one owns it but the capitalists own it now so and now the the capitalists are buying up small farms there won t be any small farms in fifty years time they ll all be run by big corporations
1	mm
1	all the animals are farmed in buildings pigs the cattle pause dur short all farmed inside sheep
1	yes i think we we were lucky in our generation to to have been born when we were cos i wouldn t like to be growing up now
1	no pause dur short well i m still growing up now
1	vocal desc laugh yeah i m still wondering what i m gonna do when i grow up
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh pause dur long
1	me pause dur long
1	what s your take on it
1	well i think most of what you ve said is absolutely true pause dur short it s erm pause dur short we seem to trunc ha trunc be our er as as you said it s erm all of our natural born freedoms are gradually being eroded pause dur short are being controlled more and more pause dur short i mean look at the society we in we re in we re lucky in many respects to be in the society we re living in look at the amount of people trying to get here er illegally so they can benefit from it but er pause dur short it s thinking er when you think this is one of the best places to live vocal desc laugh and all the things that are wrong with it pause dur short the things we can t do pause dur short more and more control over us more and more spying on us pause dur short that have er come to light in the last few years the whistle blowers pause dur short you see i america the er the time limit on the erm on the er er american government s er legal right to snoop on people s private emails has now expired so and like they now can t do do that unless they they get apply for a specific permission but i saw an on a programme not long ago in the uk when er the police or government erm apply for the the the legal right to do this to its citizens it s it s mm almost automatically granted in ninety six percent of the cases pause dur short and they ve never been more er surveillance you know the cctvs pause dur short and er i m sure there s lots of things that are gonna come to light sooner or later that they re doing now pause dur short mm spying on us pause dur long but we ve still got the right to a certain degree of to go out on the street get up on your soapbox and say what you like more or less pause dur long i think in china that erm they re not allowed to have meetings of more than six people or something like that pause dur short at er in any one place unless they ve got trunc poli trunc police permission pause dur short but that s gonna be an interesting case sooner or later because pause dur short the the generation that s now starting to reproduce and er they ve grown up in a in a society although strictly controlled by the government erm they re expecting more and more freedoms so that s it s a lot of people think that sooner or later there s gonna be a revolution there pause dur short but er i don t know it s er they ve got such a tight control on everything on everybody pause dur long
1	that s unclear yeah and most of the governments in the world pause dur long it doesn t bode well for the future pause dur long it was interesting watching that programme inside the medieval mind the other day
1	oh yeah
1	after he mentioned what if you remember he mentioned what happened after the black death
1	i don t think i was watching it
1	yeah you watched it
1	did i
1	sat there and watched how the how the peasants were treated and
1	oh right yeah
1	and one thing he you know what they could do to serfs they serfs you worked for the person and that was it for the rest of your life and er
1	mm
1	you were enslaved to them basically you couldn t say well i don t want to work on your land anymore you couldn t do that you er your children were trunc b trunc born into serfdom so it it was that was all all pretty trunc sc trunc scary and horrible wasn t it so erm what pause dur short er happened after the black death was that the erm because there were there wasn t the labour it killed so many people that there wasn t the labour left in the in the land
1	oh
1	so then pause dur short er you found that the the serfs well they gave the instance of a plough man who said no i i want more money vocal desc laugh and i want better living conditions to plough your land and i shall go elsewhere to find it and that black death had an effect on the on the system so all i can think of is well you know it s now maybe we re so controlled because we re overpopulated and they find they fear pause dur short that if there was a revolution by the working man er pause dur short they would be swamped wouldn t they and so they have to control them even tighter pause dur short it s interesting listening to that mm er there was a guy on pause dur short on the pause dur short on youtube i don t know if it was noam chomsky but he was saying that people pause dur short vocal desc cough er pause dur short when they erm pause dur long why people aren t voting is because er i think he was talking about democracy and capitalism he was saying so many people er pause dur short don t vote because they they believe they re powerless anyway it s they re they re they re not going to be listened to anyway and it s only erm er and the governments aren t doing anything or the english government isn t doing anything and the american government for the dispossessed the poor
1	mm
1	and the ones who haven t got money
1	mm
1	which is becoming the greater amount of people in the country vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	even the middle class there are suffering so he s erm er er so he was talking about england and i would imagine america that erm the er being a democracy it doesn t count for anything because they re not making the laws that benefit the people of the country
1	mm
1	you know the country and the government should be there to benefit the people
1	mm
1	not just the privileged few
1	mm
1	or the bankers
1	that s just a pause dur short bit one sided isn t it cos er for big
1	well
1	big business
1	mm he s great to listen to noam chomsky
1	yeah oh he is
1	i think he s jewish isn t he
1	yeah
1	yeah a good pause dur short you wanna hear what he has to say about pause dur short israel vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	is just get rid of it if it bomb the lot of it vocal desc laugh wipe it off the face of the earth
1	vocal desc sigh well if anybody did dare that dare do that they d take a hell of a lot of people with them pause dur short supposed to have about a hundred and eighty missiles at the moment
1	well
1	and they don t trunc kn trunc admit to it but
1	israel s been experimenting with dirty bombs
1	yeah
1	have you seen that
1	yeah i saw that the other night
1	they ve they ve tested about five or six dirty bombs so they let go of a dirty bomb and then they go and see what what it s caused what damage it s caused and so i suppose that information could be used in several ways one way is what damage you can inflict on your enemy pause dur short maybe a to create a trunc radiatio trunc radiated buffer state around you pause dur short irradiated buffer state rather and er pause dur short or whether you can er develop a non dirty bomb pause dur short through those processes but that s what they ve been testing non dirty bombs to see how non dirty they were not dirty bombs to see how dirty they were pause dur short do you get my drift pause dur short why test the bomb to see how dirty it is unless you think well we ll see if someone sends one here who i don t can t imagine it s no one trunc li trunc i don t think any of their enemies er have got any nuclear weapons pakistan might have pakistan
1	mm
1	pakistan s got some i think
1	mm
1	but erm oh yeah how do we attempt to clean up or how do we pause dur short trunc h trunc er what s gonna happen if we we do let this go on all these other states what effects what will we have to deal with pause dur short in what in what it will be essentially land that we we now claim as victors
1	mm
1	i don t know pause dur short but but er pause dur short i don t know why test the dirty bomb pause dur long see you re good at chess so pause dur short you ve got that sort of mind haven t you to
1	well i wish i was
1	well
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it s only they say trunc li trunc er erm it s like a game of war isn t it chess they say

1	i did i i gave up for eight months
1	yeah
1	a couple of years ago and erm pause dur short er i i got better mm
1	right

1	and i just i i don t even consciously do it i put i say i ll think on that i ll think on that i ll try and see if i can remember and it goes in there and bugger me quite often nine times out of ten i think
1	mm
1	or even more the the answer comes out
1	mm
1	it s er you know trusting in the subconscious unconscious i don t know
1	the universe
1	god it might be all a bit weirder than we imagine vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	yeah a lot of people believe we have to unlearn everything before we start learning pause dur long

1	yes
1	i don t many people can say that a lot of it is cowardice vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh i used to dread going cos of trunc th trunc going home from school sometimes and you d see some kids you thought might be trouble and try and trunc av trunc avoid them
1	yeah pause dur long
1	still i think it is an amazing record
1	yeah
1	especially when pause dur short in my adult life i was for what eighteen years in the east and a couple of years here working in pubs you know as a landlord and
1	yes were you ever threatened
1	and er oh yeah pause dur short when i first took over anon type place
1	yes
1	erm i had to get rid of most of the customers i inherited it was such a rough
1	really
1	yeah local mafia and the lot pause dur short and trunc s trunc had a gun trunc p trunc trunc p trunc pointed in my face er but even throwing people out is pause dur short which i i had to do occasionally
1	what did you

1	do when the guy pointed the gun in your face
1	what could i do vocal desc laugh just stood there pause dur short and somehow i always managed to talk my way out of trouble pause dur long very lucky pause dur long anon nametype f type name was a good help a great help in that respect cos often a woman can do things a bloke can t and pause dur short to get obnoxious people out
1	yeah pause dur long
1	she did well pause dur short bless her pause dur short and this reminds me i ve got to send those bloody forms off and my birth certificate so she can start chasing the bank up the erm trunc in trunc insurance company up

1	how much does that cost do you reckon
1	i dunno trunc g trunc coming over here was only sixty quid
1	amazing
1	and it cost me another sixty for the extra baggage i had
1	yeah
1	but er pause dur short i d imagine it would be about the same it would be great if it is to save a bit of money pause dur short could be on standby of course pause dur long so i might have trunc t trunc if i m unlucky i might have to wait around a bit
1	oh what like trunc t trunc a couple of days sort of thing
1	i don t know trunc n trunc i i think normally they try and get you on the next flight you know if you can t get on so but if er if er anon nametype f type name chooses wisely in the middle of the week it should be alright vocal desc sigh hopefully pause dur long vocal desc sigh yeah it ll be weird getting back there
1	what s that
1	it ll be weird being back
1	will it
1	oh yeah pause dur short especially in the changed circumstances and a big question mark over the future you know pause dur long
1	i think you ll be alright
1	yeah pause dur short i think the first thing i ll do when i get back is erm try and get hold of a lawyer who can speak english to handle my application and my resident s permit
1	do you think you ll need that
1	well it s either that i will need something i need a visa some trunc sor trunc kind of visa

1	yes
1	so i was was thinking about when i go back i ll contact him on skype and er have a chat with him pause dur short about how to do but it s just they re going down to hong kong to do it
1	if it s a business visa then might look at your age and say no
1	well i don t trunc a trunc i don t think age pause dur short precludes you from running a business it it it certainly trunc ca trunc you know can t be employed legally that avenue s cut but er pause dur short dunno i ll have to see pause dur short there must be a way pause dur short well there s got to be a way pause dur long yeah vocal desc misc pause dur long there certainly is a certain amount of uncertainty of in this i m certain
1	you sure about that pause dur short you certain about that are you

1	right well that s that s fine i can i can get there easily
1	do you think these vegetables are overdone
1	erm
1	mm
1	no i think they re fine
1	i think they re a bit overdone pause dur long
1	i think they re just right actually
1	no pause dur short the cauliflower is too soft pause dur long you re what about eating
1	erm pause dur short well i haven t thought about it really but erm i m assuming i can erm eat at lunchtime and then just take sandwiches for trunc th trunc for trunc th trunc for the evening
1	oh no
1	how do would you prefer to eat out somewhere
1	well i d i wouldn t in a way because pause dur short it s it s gonna be very inconvenient er finding anywhere that s decent and erm we need to find somewhere serving pre theatre dinners
1	yes
1	and then i suppose it would be sensible to find somewhere locally well because you wouldn t want a tube delay or something
1	no pause dur long no being a prom concert it s it s likely that everywhere is going to be very busy
1	yeah i ve seen erm but erm pause dur short well any anywhere that s any trunc u trunc any good but on the other hand sandwiches would be horrible because they might get spilled or crumbs everywhere pause dur long
1	well we can just erm if it s nice weather we can just go out and find a bench somewhere and eat them
1	it ll be dark by that time at that time of year won t it
1	second of september no not not at seven thirty i don t think surely pause dur long
1	well there s the polish place on exhibition road but but i notice they ve taken the carpets away and it was the food was never any good anyway
1	no i don t erm
1	mm
1	yes i i remember that er polish place and i didn t think the food was particularly interesting pause dur long
1	there s a german place next door
1	oh is there
1	yes the goethe institute or something i m not sure if it s open in the evening anyway and it s nothing special pause dur long i wonder whether the best thing wouldn t be a hotel somewhere pause dur long
1	mm expensive though probably pause dur long
1	er well there s that erm pause dur short there s that bistro place that erm anon nametype m type name well when went to in near in piccadilly pause dur short in the basement but that could be quite noisy but they re quite efficient
1	mm pause dur long well if they re efficient that might pause dur short make up for the erm for the noisiness cos we won t be there quite so long pause dur long
1	and it s very popular well i ll check erm pause dur long i ll check that then because it s sort of on the right line isn t it
1	mm
1	er
1	on the right what
1	line
1	on the right line pause dur long you mean right underground right i don t know i don t know which trunc wh trunc do are are you talking about the one that erm anon nametype m type name went to oh that was an italian restaurant wasn t it
1	you haven t been there
1	no right oh okay so i don t know where it is
1	it s just off piccadilly circus
1	oh right pause dur long actually i don t know what tube you get to the royal albert hall is it the circle line piccadilly line
1	or victoria
1	oh
1	i think erm or erm pause dur short or piccadilly
1	mm
1	hang on it s not victoria it s circle or piccadilly so actually it s quite good
1	yeah that s right pause dur long
1	i suppose we could eat at the barbican but pause dur short i don t like i don t i don t think the food s any any use there particularly
1	no it s it s out of the way as well it s not pause dur short it s not near is it pause dur long so we d have to eat early
1	no pause dur short er yeah because you could take the circle line but it would take ages and also it s very dangerous because if you change er if you get the wrong pause dur short you could end up you could end up in kensington high street by mistake because some of the circle lines do the strange things
1	mm
1	they don t all and they also they re quite slow i think going around
1	yeah pause dur long so what sort of a day have you had
1	i don t know erm pause dur short just nonstop as usual what about you
1	yeah it was erm i managed to catch up on on my emails and erm i did quite a few admin type tasks
1	tuesday
1	yeah
1	your meeting day
1	it wasn t too bad for meetings it was quite quiet today but we had erm what we call erm a town hall which is erm supposed to be an hour and a half but is only and hour
1	where
1	this trunc after trunc it was this afternoon it was via trunc tele trunc it telephone conference
1	what from your desk
1	i asked i i dialled in from my desk but erm you had the option of going to erm a a large room pause dur short erm and listening to it
1	i thought the whole point was to go somewhere
1	well this it s trunc w trunc it could it s run from the states you see so the presenter was in the in new york and it was just erm it was just going through a slide a a powerpoint deck and erm
1	are there any are they really any ever any good
1	yes they i mean it s just sort of information sharing and an opportunity to ask questions pause dur long i mean we do it we do also have erm one by meeting by video conference pause dur short where the presenter is actually up on large and you couldn t actually see them up on a large screen
1	er it wasn t this one
1	as i said it was just a telephone
1	telephone audio
1	mm pause dur long
1	why are they trying to save money on video cameras or something
1	yeah erm pause dur short it s the it s the format that our particular pause dur short boss prefers i suppose pause dur short cos he s not he s trunc n trunc it wasn t erm a company wide one it was specifically for our area which is more urgent
1	maybe the trunc qua trunc maybe the technical quality is actually better than the video conferencing pause dur long i mean nowadays there s no excuse for not getting a very good special phone line like broadcasting you know when you have a trunc stu trunc a broadcast from a studio
1	yes
1	they have special lines so they don t sound like telephones pause dur short and when they do sound like telephones it s because somebody s using an ordinary bt phone or even worse a mobile or
1	mm
1	even worse that one of those skype things
1	mm well i think they re just ordinary bt lines
1	well that s not very good cos
1	well
1	they could afford better than that couldn t they vocal desc cough
1	they could do but
1	yeah
1	i i m not complaining because erm pause dur short i can usually hear quite clearly pause dur short i can hear better listening to someone down the telephone than i can sitting in a room where
1	mm
1	the the sound is coming out of speakers even though i can see them talking on a video screen
1	yeah but supposing they had a broadcast quality phone line whatever that s called trunc y trunc you you might be able to hear better still
1	yeah maybe pause dur long but i mean we we do have erm pause dur short we do have some a very high quality video conference facility but it s it s in quite a small room so you can only have
1	google plus
1	can only have that with erm small groups
1	how many
1	erm you could probably get about twenty people in that in that room
1	you mean they can all be seen
1	yeah pause dur short it s like one side of the room you can actually see pause dur short erm a group of people er er on your the end of the line pause dur short and see if they are sitting on the opposite side of the table and they can see you
1	but are they really on the opposite side of the table
1	no
1	i mean pause dur short what
1	no of course not but they they
1	no but i mean are they sitting in a line
1	yes
1	then why don t they sit in a semicircle
1	well it is a semicircle actually yes you re right pause dur short and i think there are about three cameras which er are trained on you but
1	operated automatically or by a human
1	i think it s just automatic but what what s strange about them is that when someone s looking at you they tend to look at you on the screen pause dur short and not in the camera so when they re looking at you they appear not to be looking at you so that that s a bit pause dur short confusing sometimes cos you re not quite sure if they re talking to you personally
1	yeah well
1	or
1	one of the students did something like that last week because they went to find a different classroom and then they phoned up from a room that they d found and one of them must have been holding the phone as a camera so you could see the face of the other one it wasn t possible that the person making the call was holding pause dur short i don t think it wouldn t have been possible would it
1	i don t know
1	do you think the person making the call cos i saw their face the face of the person speaking and i assumed the phone was being held by the other person because there were two of them
1	mm trunc probab trunc possibly cos i think it must be difficult to speak and think about what you re saying and and and and hold it steady at the same time
1	and how did he know also how did he know that he was in the picture
1	mm
1	in the frame
1	i don t know cos
1	and then and then and then well cos he must have been erm the er trunc ca trunc the mirror image of erm of my situation where one of the students in in the room where we were was holding his pause dur short holding the phone pause dur short for me to see so presumably that was on camera as well
1	mm
1	so i could trunc o trunc i couldn t see myself obviously i could only see erm this person in the other building
1	well we we ve done some meetings where we ve used some application like skype where where you actually pause dur short in the corner of the screen you get a trunc li trunc a small picture which shows you what
1	yeah we do that
1	people the other end can see
1	what for
1	it trunc sho trunc it shows you what the people at the other end can actually see of it
1	well we have erm split screens for erm the speaker and any powerpoint that they re using pause dur short so that when it s when it s broadcast or recorded but and played back later you can see both the speaker and the pause dur short slides
1	oh pause dur long
1	but that means the speaker is often minute pause dur short doesn t though
1	you
1	it shouldn t have to be minute but they are in one in the one i used today anyway the er this morning
1	mm pause dur short well we have erm pause dur short we ve had meetings where you where the presenter is going through slides and pause dur short they tend to switch between him and the slides
1	yeah but that must be a that s the whole point that s what i suppose our system tries to avoid because that could be quite irritating because you re not in control of when you switch from the from the slide to the speaker are you or vice versa
1	no we re not in control of it no but it s like when you
1	yeah so what if you re looking at something and you haven t finished interpreting
1	yeah that yeah well that s it exactly trunc s trunc it s like when you re watching the news
1	yeah well the answer is not to watch it they trunc d trunc you know it
1	that is quite difficult
1	it
1	trying to read something anyway while they re speaking pause dur short cos i can t i can t read and take it in and listen at the same time anyway
1	well i doubt whether a lot of people can t i think pause dur short cos the speakers are probably they don t stop pause dur short long enough to let people take things in
1	no they don t no pause dur long
1	so is it next week that your mother s coming
1	no it s it s the week of the proms concert
1	so it s not next week it s the week after is it
1	it must be pause dur short well let s work it out
1	i i don t need to work it out i ve got my diary right here and it and so i don t need to i can just look it up if i wanted to pause dur long
1	well the concert s three weeks today pause dur long shall i shut this window now
1	yes please probably midges or insects that will come pause dur long oh pause dur long actually they re not coming trunc f trunc it s nearly three weeks
1	yes pause dur short it s three weeks pause dur short or just over three weeks
1	well thank goodness i ll be on leave that week sort of pause dur long but i don t know whether i ll feel like eating much after a luncheon oh no that er the other thing about these trousers i really i i don t think i m i can be bothered to to either to take i i don t think the iron will iron out those things because they re probably steamed or manufactured in pause dur short it doesn t say anything i i looked
1	mm you you could be right pause dur short the they ve obviously been done like that but for effect and
1	yeah
1	they re meant to to be trunc r trunc trunc r trunc rucked apart like
1	it s really annoying and i could take them back she said i could anyway er the the the assistant but pause dur short but i needed a i need a new pair of trousers anyway
1	mm pause dur long
1	the trouble is they re not really suitable for work are they they re alright in the summer i suppose
1	yeah
1	but may but maybe not
1	though i think that makes them look a bit trunc inf trunc too too informal
1	maybe i should take them back then
1	i think trunc s trunc well
1	it s just a gigantic waste of time pause dur short i only
1	you ve got to take the other one back anyway aren t you the top are you taking that back
1	i don t know do you do you want it
1	no no thank you
1	erm because i m not even sure about the quality though i when i when i undid the buttons they didn t undo very easily i don t think it s been made with great care the buttons and the button holes are
1	well it s probably cheap clothing
1	yeah and that s what annoys me because if you can get it the same thing or similar from primark for a couple of quid pause dur long i only went to get a a a a a card er a congratulations card
1	mm pause dur long
1	and then we didn t need anything else and so but then i thought oh yeah i d use that coupon erm and i found out i could use it on clothing so i thought i ll have a look and see if there s anything on sale and so that s what i trunc fou trunc i noticed those two things but obviously really i would have bought erm a long sleeved shirt if i if there d been one on sale but there wasn t
1	mm yes so have you tried those trousers on
1	in the shop
1	oh
1	they re not not a particularly good fit
1	no
1	they re a bit big actually oddly around the waist
1	really
1	well they must make them bigger than they say
1	well a thirty two aren t they around the waist and it s
1	yes
1	mm pause dur short maybe they shrink maybe they re trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc sor trunc the sort of cotton that shrinks
1	yeah but then they won t be no it s more likely that they re like marks and spencer s they just make everything bigger than the than the size that they say they are pause dur short vocal desc sigh pause dur long i just wanted to go home early to carry on with this other work stuff anyway i just i want to get that s my task for tonight i want to get all of that done and dusted and then that s out of the way
1	mm
1	and so i d er you know i i didn t pause dur short i just thought it would be a quick trip on the way home but pause dur short that s why when it when it mushrooms into something complicated
1	i just put them by the door and then or keep them in the car and just remember to return them next time you go to
1	well
1	sainsbury s
1	i think i would forget it if i put them in the car boot cos i don t open it trunc somet trunc well pause dur long it s still full of junk from when the house was tidied
1	oh right pause dur long is that books
1	i don t know just general rubbish whatever pause dur short couldn t go anywhere else pause dur long have you been checking zoopla
1	not not since i ve got back
1	well you ought to look and then you could see that house that i ve that erm that i mentioned and see what
1	yeah i ll have a look for it yes
1	i know where it is it s where it s that one where you road where you go under the railway bridge and you can t turn right pause dur short and i think it s there of course they ve photographed it so it looks as if it s semi secluded and in a quiet road
1	mm pause dur long yes well well
1	but you wouldn t do anyway it s too late now because it s been sold
1	it s sold right that s
1	and i m not and like i said i m not even sure that i want to go to the hassle of all and all the expense of moving some somewhere further into this place i m not even sure i like particularly like and the only that s the and these seagulls have been driving me mad this year
1	mm pause dur short i ve not noticed them since i ve been back particularly
1	yeah they ve quietened down a bit pause dur long
1	yes i think pause dur short i think really it s it s time something was done about them because they seem to be getting worse year after year and so it can t just keep going on can it
1	well it did it did in was it anon type place where they tried to shoot them and then there was a big fuss about it
1	mm well perhaps there are pause dur short other ways of controlling them like erm breaking their eggs
1	poison pause dur short putting some foxes up on the roof
1	vocal desc laugh okay you ll end up with foxes as well
1	what s your evidence
1	i think well i just think i see i see them a lot
1	where
1	here
1	when
1	around and about i see them quite often well not not recently because i ve not been walking at dusk but when it does get dark i ve quite often see one walking across the the anon type place road and there s some that live in that little island
1	are there
1	or well they go in there
1	really
1	yeah pause dur short and i ve seen them up erm up the driveway as well pause dur short up the drive is it the drive
1	well that reminds me i ve got this unclear aisles unclear thing to do and then oh yeah i ve got to find another companion piece for that and then any day in fact i thought i might come home and find this this other thing waiting and then that ll be quite stressful and that s why i want to get this out of the way because if one of those comes through the letterbox then that d be that s it that s another thing on top of work
1	mm
1	and it means you you know when it s a trunc n trunc a nice evening well you can t go out anyway unless you go for a run and then it s all over in thirty minutes or so
1	oh
1	erm pause dur short oh anon nametype f type name said something erm nice today er she found erm apparently erm you know that did i told you about that erm trunc w trunc write up for erm anon type place didn t i that they used the paper in where was it that didn t go this year anon type place
1	i don t know i can t remember you even trunc s trunc
1	they used it they used it as a an example of of er how to write up a report of your presentation
1	right
1	so pause dur short they and and it s er and they put it online
1	oh this is your example
1	yeah
1	oh that s good
1	er but even better pause dur short they ve done all the all the work of putting in little boxes and things saying pause dur short er this is pause dur short trunc th trunc this is this achieves the purpose of x or this is good because it s so they ve labelled it all anyway and put little comments all around and it s on it s as a pdf i ll show you later
1	oh right yes
1	but i don t know where erm well presumably there s a link to it from the main site
1	mm
1	and that and that explains why i ve been getting these emails from these people overseas cos i thought i i just assumed well i guessed it was to do with that write up because of the subject cos the topic pause dur short erm and so i assumed that they d been been present at the at the workshop
1	mm
1	but obviously pause dur short well more probably they ve they ve just they weren t there at all but they they ve found or seen it online
1	yeah pause dur short mm
1	so it just makes you realise it s important pause dur short but that blog i don t think a single person s looked at it
1	is that where that thing is
1	trunc sc trunc trunc blo trunc
1	where it s is that where it is on a blog
1	no of course it s not i m talking about my blog
1	right oh your
1	nobody s
1	oh right and the other one you were writing a few weeks ago
1	yes you ve got to
1	mm
1	do it every week really and you ve got to like link it and have twitter and all this stuff and oh i think it would drive me mad you d trunc ha trunc you d always having you d always have to be pause dur short engaging and
1	yes
1	messing around and you d probably have car accidents and things
1	mm pause dur short i can imagine yes pause dur long
1	and pause dur short the other thing i can imagine is that you d engineer situations to write about
1	in order to keep the momentum
1	yeah
1	going and
1	that wouldn t be very ethical would it
1	no
1	or erm at least erm you d have to have your antennae out and be noticing trunc s trunc things all the time and perhaps you vocal desc laugh if you had the mm luxury of reflection and time to reflect on stuff maybe you could think back over your day and you d trunc th trunc and you d pick out a few interesting things to write about but if normally you didn t pause dur short have time and you just go from one thing to the other then
1	mm pause dur short well if there s if there s no activity on a on a blog people will quickly lose interest i mean i
1	but why would they they wouldn t why would they see it in the first place
1	erm i don t know the
1	you have to put a link
1	it yeah the they would be looking for something in particular they would be looking for something so they may do a hash search for something so
1	oh
1	you need to make sure that when you create your pause dur short blog on twitter or whatever it is
1	it
1	it needs to have hashtag doesn t it or something like that
1	i did put a hash thing i think but erm it s probably a meaningless one cos i didn t think about the consequences pause dur long
1	cos i er i pause dur short yes you do or because you have to trunc s trunc you use it as a search thing so your trunc hasht trunc your hash the
1	but that s twitter isn t it
1	that s twitter yes i ve only used twitter
1	yeah but do you think the same applies to blogs perhaps
1	i don t know
1	vocal desc sigh i don t understand it s all too it s all a bit i don t even trunc kn trunc i think google have done it on purpose because pause dur short i have never succeeded yet in erm signing out of that page
1	oh
1	i don t even know properly how to sign in i just have to mess around and suddenly it appears
1	oh
1	and then and then i have to crash out i just
1	so where where is the site is it erm is it an internal
1	it s no it s blogger it s google google blogger or whatever
1	oh right well
1	but i think they ve made it like that on purpose so you can t escape so once you re in there you just stay there all day or
1	yeah
1	or have it open on your screen somewhere all the time
1	mm i don t know
1	you know cos trunc y trunc you that that hotmail was doing that at one time if you remember the the thing to log out was suddenly disappeared or was made tiny and it was right up in the top it was where you don t didn t look well they made it almost invisible
1	mm pause dur long
1	no i trunc th trunc i think it must ruin people s eyes cos they they make the screen so busy trunc wi trunc with different banners and colours and little bits and then they say oh you can always enlarge it and in fact of course there s a legislative requirement that you should be able to do things like enlarge and turn volume up because of disabilities
1	yes of course
1	but you can t you still trunc co trunc it doesn t work because if you re trying to read script if you re trying to read text on er on the trunc p trunc on the screen
1	mm
1	if you enlarge it a great deal then you lose you ve always gotta be moving the the page around
1	yes you re gonna use more
1	from left to right
1	it s more it s more awkward yes
1	in fact and and that isn t the way that your eye would work with hard copy because you might be jumping around with your eye i mean and then they ll stops you jumping around the screen
1	mm pause dur long
1	i don t think and there was this er we we watched this erm unclear dot com presentation today which turned out to be trunc m trunc far too long it erm i hadn t erm i hadn t noticed and it was all on and there was a this speaker had a photograph of er her daughter and her friend in the kitchen of course it was it was north america and erm they were perched on these stools it must have been north america and erm they were all erm hunched over their mobile phones and texting somebody else so their body language they they re all they all had their backs to each other and they just trunc m trunc might as well have been on mars or somewhere
1	yes pause dur short someone was saying the other day that erm pause dur short he said trunc wi trunc trunc wi trunc with all the technology we ve got you you can go you can go a day without talking to anyone
1	yeah because you re busy texting
1	you re busy texting and it s you don t need to go into a bank anymore and you ve got the atms and you do your shopping erm
1	yeah but when you do go into a bank you ve gotta make sure that you erm adhere to the the the trunc cond trunc trunc con trunc scraping have you cut those plants
1	yes why
1	because i told you there s er something on the windowpane especially when it was windy over the weekend
1	oh could you still hear something blowing
1	scraping across the glass
1	oh right pause dur short oh maybe it s grown back again but i cut it i did cut it right back
1	well maybe it s not that window maybe i can hear maybe it s that one
1	mm i ll have to have a look
1	have you noticed next door hasn t put anything out in front of the window
1	what do you mean
1	they must have they must have did they put a concrete on where you know where we ve got a flowerbed there
1	yeah
1	and they ve got concrete
1	yes it s always been like that i
1	what it ever trunc sin trunc well in before they got there
1	oh no not not before they got there i don t remember what was there before they got there but they er i think it s more than likely that they redid it or they
1	what when they had the drive done you think
1	no i think it was before then
1	one of their little schemes
1	mm pause dur short yeah it s trunc be trunc
1	trunc anyw trunc
1	it s been it s been luck like that for some time why what what s the point you re trying to make
1	that there s nothing there they re just being left
1	oh yeah cos they took all their pots or most of them
1	most you mean they left some
1	they left they ve left some things haven t they
1	i don t know i haven t looked i haven t wanted to look
1	yes i mean next door she s not done anything has she yet
1	no well thank trunc good trunc it s good in a way pause dur short but in another way it s a bad omen i think cos
1	mm
1	it means that things are just going to slide and get worse
1	well she s not cutting the grass cos there are a couple of fellas came round last tuesday was it last tuesday when i was working from home erm a couple of trunc f trunc fellas and i think one of them is her father or uncle or something
1	do you mean she s not even employing anybody pause dur short to do it
1	no i think she trunc ye trunc i think her family s doing it for her
1	why
1	well she s working all the time
1	yeah but why but nag but er if she can afford why can t she afford to get one of the many many local landscape
1	well presumably because her family have offered to do it for her for free
1	vocal desc sigh it s a bit well a bit weird isn t it
1	not necessarily no pause dur short that s what trunc f trunc trunc f trunc
1	i think it s weird because it looks the whole house and just one person
1	mm
1	but that on the other hand it just shows you how small these houses are pause dur short they were never meant for children for a start
1	no not for children no
1	no because they re not they re not large enough and that s why pause dur short erm very there have been very very few pause dur short in this place
1	mm
1	in fact it was a bit it s maybe that s why they ve gone from the erm corner
1	mm probably pause dur short but cos they re getting quite old probably those those children they re both teenagers now
1	probably
1	they did but they they created two rooms out of the pause dur short out of your room they they created
1	did they how do you know
1	because i think we went she showed us didn t she
1	no but no the bathroom are you not getting confused with anon nametype f type name because that s what they did with their daughter s
1	yeah they i know they did but i ve not seen theirs
1	oh
1	but it s we ve we ve seen anon nametype f type name s
1	but i don t
1	it s it s when she took us round the house
1	yes i but i that trunc c trunc i i don t i don t remember what they looked like er but i remember i think i remember anon nametype f type name s
1	well i ve never been inside anon nametype f type name s so
1	cos that was quite cleverly done well i i mm i don t think i m confusing the two houses pause dur short are you sure that you re not thinking about anon nametype f type name s upstairs cos they did it very neatly with making wardrobes from those erm places under the roof
1	well maybe it was anon nametype f type name s pause dur long
1	she showed us
1	no i m i m i m pretty sure it was anon nametype f type name
1	but i don t think she gave us a tour of the whole house she showed us the bathroom and the kitchen i think but pause dur short that i don t
1	and and she she used used trunc s trunc she used that space under the
1	anon nametype f type name s
1	anon nametype f type name s as well
1	for what
1	cupboards
1	oh pause dur long anyway it s a disaster because when trunc sl trunc eventually people are going to you know this er environmental categories what is it d or e or f or something
1	mm don t know pause dur short d or e i think
1	so pause dur short if you you know like pause dur short if you had the choice if i had the choice i d go for i d go for a brand new pause dur short in fact the the best thing would be to have one designed pause dur short properly from scratch pause dur short and built from nothing you just buy buy some
1	mm
1	land build it properly like the one that i saw in anon type place near near anon type place park they use wood nowadays you know cherry wood and things and they have the solar panelling and everything new and pause dur short and clean and so on and erm none none of this horrible asbestos stuff and badly designed roofs and wasted space you trunc d trunc have it done properly from scratch i think that s the best thing and then okay so that would be an a presumably
1	mm
1	and then why would you expect anybody to buy this place pause dur short when it s a d or e or something
1	mm if they re environmentally conscious pause dur short trunc cons trunc conscientious then yes i quite agree
0	erm her and her mum found him in an armchair like dead christmas eve
0	yeah
0	for quite a while now i didn t i didn t know i didn t care whatever but that laundry room is exactly underneath my blue room
0	yeah
0	so it might just be coincidence it might be my mind putting meaning to something that there doesn t need to be meaning to or anything
0	yeah
0	yeah it s like it really really freaked me out because it was like someone did die in that
0	yeah where did he stay when he moved here
0	yeah
0	personally i don t think
0	it s like when me and anon nametype m type name heard the footsteps and he heard them as well you could hear them in that room and they would stop like you could judge where distance is they would just stop in that doorway never in my bedroom just that room
0	well i don t know because this was a family home and like the amount of generations that people have lived and died here but i don t
0	yeah
0	mm
0	like all about spirits and like healing and all that kind of stuff
0	yeah
0	as the name implies
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	in my bedroom when i was really young but i used to have these really really horrible nightmares about it wasn t a person it was like black smoke in chains
0	mm
0	yeah
0	like and we were all freaked out we all legged it like to the bottom of the field and like fucking freaked out pause dur short but
0	yeah
0	and a car going that way and she got hit by both like she got sandwiched between them both and got chucked up in the air and she were dead like instantly and then a few days after or a few weeks another girl died pause dur short i don t know how she died though can t remember i think she trunc k trunc killed herself or someone murdered her like it was pretty bad
0	vocal desc laugh pause dur long erm do you remember unclear
0	i literally i don t think i ve even thought about that since it s happened
0	it s just a thought that s just come to me i ve never brought it up with my mum like i ve literally i feel like i ve not you know when something happens and sometimes you replay memories
0	like it s just sort of hit me so it just reminds me that tomorrow i ll talk to my dad or i ll erm talk to my mum about it and just see if it fits anything she ever felt or
0	yeah
0	cos when i lived in that house in anon type place i mean i moved here when i d just turned ten
0	yeah that s what i mean but saying that i used to come out with some right things my mum said apparently some really weird things and she d be like i m sorry what
0	oh they re not
0	go on what were you going to say
0	no that s it so i don t know
0	yeah vocal desc laugh

0	yeah pause dur short cos then like we ve done for erm pause dur short scotland pause dur short or glasgow vocal desc laugh

0	it was the most incredible hamper pause dur short and we were like we re angry but pause dur short okay
0	yeah i think pause dur short yeah i think pause dur short yeah i don t know how pause dur short there s like different things they kind of pause dur short i i don t know pause dur short i don t know if you can choose your own but that s quite a good idea isn t it pause dur short like
0	if you get the basket pause dur short and then pause dur short you re allowed to put like ten items pause dur short or whatever
0	i dunno pause dur long erm pause dur short unclear i dunno unclear
0	no vocal desc laugh i know

0	yeah she has missed him unclear didn t she
0	unclear i m up to that point unclear going round
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	environments and stuff that like stimulates unclear
0	well he can stay in bed until i can get ready and then he can get up
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	unclear got unclear to be earlier than him
0	in the morning
0	yeah then like nine twelve three six and then like eight say on average
0	mm
0	he just went
0	oh he was startled
0	cos otherwise i m not i don t know if he ll sleep through because he s had like there s seven ounces less than usual
0	no five
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	technically
0	really but then say he starts getting hungry about like half six cos he hasn t seemed to have been lasting three hours today for some reason erm pause dur short so he might still want the same amount of he might think i ve slept through but i still want the same amount that i would have had
0	oh
0	seven ounce ones at one and four
0	oh okay i see yeah
0	so it s not because i was gonna try and give him an extra ounce in every feed so that he s not technically missing a bottle and gave him
0	yeah pause dur short
0	yeah you don t know if it s like disruption of
0	yeah
0	what do you think pause dur short what do you think
0	yeah but then also i said it could just be a phase like i don t expect i still expect him to get up at like two o clock so anything later is a bonus really
0	but erm
0	what does she wake him up
0	times and stuff so it s like well then his it probably is a routine for him whereas his nap times in the day if he s awake and happy i ll leave him awake when i know he starts getting tired i ll try and get him to sleep if he s hungry like less than three hours i don t like to give him too much but if he s really screaming i d be like well sod it you re gonna have to have it then
0	yeah like he s like dictating it to you
0	what do you do
0	so i will come down and tip a bit out and top it up with a bit of boiling water and then put it in
0	well he seems to be fine vocal desc laugh
0	like but if he s not had a feed and like i think i ll give him a warmer breakfast pause dur short but yeah he is fine so
0	oh yeah erm so i m going over on tuesday after work and i ll find out she hasn t said anything else apart from she just sent me a few photos of anon nametype f type name in some dresses
0	edited yeah
0	filter pause dur short so it looks like her bruises pause dur short erm pause dur short on her eyes have gone but i don t know if that was the trunc pho trunc erm because it was black and white
0	oh yeah it looks like it s not
0	fallen out at the front but it s like it s sort of comes from the back to like cover it yeah
0	yeah
0	i know that sounds stupid pause dur short but that s
0	his mum says they don t usually have like the bridge of their nose and stuff like yet
0	mm
0	but i think that she unclear
0	unclear
0	was that a yes did you just say yes
0	oh
0	let s bounce you oh
0	bottles and pyjamas i have to do
0	i know
0	oh yeah yeah
0	i don t know
0	unclear
0	and i sometimes get into bed and think oh it s chilly
0	you just wanted to see me did you vocal desc laugh did you and what s happened to your top again i pulled that down pause dur short mr wriggly bum pause dur short tickle tickle tickle pause dur long
1	so what have we got planned for supper pause dur short
1	well there s filled pasta spinach and ricotta
1	mm mm
1	with some variety of sauce
1	what what do you think you ve got
1	erm tomato and basil
1	mm mm that s a good standby
1	sweet tomato erm tomato and sweet pepper unclear
1	that s probably my overall favourite
1	i don t think i ve got a vegetable one
1	oh i don t think i have that one is that the one we have in the summer
1	possibly
1	which you no that was a that was a curry one i think
1	oh we had the curry one yeah we i don t know if they make that anymore with the lentil
1	mm that was very tasty i enjoyed that one and erm mm so if we have that today what have we got for tomorrow
1	we have some erm trunc ch trunc cheese and what are they cheese and leek plaits
1	oh yeah linda mccartney well mccartney ones
1	cheese and leek plaits yes linda mccartney ones the cheese and leek plaits with erm a random selection of sauces and vegetables
1	oh anon nametype f type name s steamed vegetables
1	my steamed vegetables which will be be root parsnip carrot er trunc pars trunc i haven t got any celery unfortunately parsnip carrot there might be leeks certainly onion tomato er what else do i put in there mushroom
1	oh
1	i quite often put the odd bit of sliced potato in there
1	but not on this occasion
1	i could do we haven t got any vocal desc laugh
1	that that little yes that does rather limit the range or so somebody informed me earlier
1	i think i ve used them all up haven t i
1	unclear so nice
1	yes no i did reserve a couple and then i think i used them yes so possibly not potato on this trunc o trunc occasion but those erm new potatoes are very nice steamed
1	mm
1	i don t think i have any courgette
1	it s not really the season for courgette is it
1	well there s still quite a lot about but they get a bit marrowy
1	yes that can easily happen in the garden with inattention
1	mm so unless you buy the erm expensive little ones
1	mm
1	so that kind of thing if you fancy
1	yes that unclear
1	i don t have any cabbage pause dur short
1	one other meal one other tea left
1	well if i can buy some staffordshire oatcakes
1	oh oatcakes
1	we could have erm cheese tomato mushroom
1	you could save a little bit of the sauce the pasta sauce
1	with a bit of pasta sauce
1	we ve done that haven t we
1	yes we could have that erm you still haven t had erm scrambled egg and
1	oh no i ve got a whole box of six
1	beans on toast because i i only need a few eggs to erm
1	mm
1	do cooking
1	mm
1	cakey cookie things with so i won t be using for eating
1	i may have to not have one of the other meals then
1	no you might have to stay longer
1	no i can t i i m going i m going back
1	stay longer to er finish up your dinners
1	no just think of those men on the stations they well where is she she s not sitting there she s not in either of the seats what do i do
1	yes
1	they d probably get a black mark if they don t have a passenger
1	they might do
1	although that that guy who didn t have to assist me when we came up seemed to be quite happy the fact
1	oh yeah he was he was quite happy yes he didn t have to do it
1	although he kept us company didn t he
1	oh yes
1	he thought he would entertain us if he couldn t assist us
1	yes yes yes he entertained us on the way
1	though he only had to go quite a short distance i feel back to his erm information points
1	well if you had been in original coach b
1	mm
1	he would have been halfway to anon type place practically cos that platform s ever so long
1	mm
1	if you think of the alphabet from b to
1	oh yes a probably
1	no
1	there isn t an a
1	no
1	so the engine
1	yeah well it s not usually the a on that train it s b and it goes to i think it probably goes to m and pause dur short lots of numbers lots of erm lots of letters so it is quite a long walk when you get in b so he might have thought he d got unclear
1	but you have more than one platform presumably
1	what pause dur short
1	the information point perhaps there s an information point at the end of each station
1	well the trunc in trunc i think when you go to the information point it s probably the one that s next door to marks and spencer s
1	oh it s somewhere just inside the door
1	because otherwise you would have to go through the barrier to get to him
1	yeah but you ve virtually got on the train haven t you by then
1	yeah
1	and i m having assistance from other
1	mm
1	although how you re meant to get assistance from other
1	mm
1	to the information point is largely in the lap of the gods
1	mm
1	but i know how it s going to happen on this occasion
1	yes
1	and indeed i can probably manage myself
1	cos the thing is if you get dropped off by a taxi pause dur short i m not entirely sure you can be dropped off at that entrance
1	oh oh isn t that where we got the taxi from
1	we got it from but they all park in that road and come round
1	oh
1	to pick up people
1	mm
1	it s for picking up i m not entirely sure
1	oh
1	if it s for dropping off
1	obviously unclear
1	but they might be able to drop you off there cos originally that was the only exit but now erm they tend to drop you off at the back of the station
1	mm
1	and you have to walk you know where the ticket er the long row of ticket offices are pause dur short erm
1	i wasn t paying attention
1	well as you came out as we headed for the exit to get the taxi off to the left and it s a bit chaos at the moment
1	mm
1	because they re erm got all that building work going on but if you go off to the left there s about sort of at least eight or ten ticket windows and you have to go past there and then down the stairs or the slope and there s all the restaurants and things you know and what was the information office that s no longer open the erm you know the anon type place one and then you go out of a door at the very far end there which is the back of the station in anon type place street
1	mm
1	as in the river
1	yes
1	you know trunc ha trunc you know the anon type place hotel that s part of the station a big white building well
1	you know i ve not been unclear
1	vaguely white cos there s anon type place
1	yes
1	opposite anon type place where the station is
1	mm
1	the station runs from behind it it must be very quite noisy staying in the anon type place hotel that white building or
1	mm
1	it s whiter than it used to be erm takes up that block more or less a lot of that block
1	mm
1	and the station is down the end of that and you go down and around a little roundabout to the back so it s quite a long way
1	mm
1	difference that s why if somebody s picking you up you ve got to sort of tell them to go to that because if you re coming out on trunc fr trunc foot you tend to come out you and catching a bus you tend to come out the front
1	anon nametype m type name picked me up didn t he that was you
1	that was from the back
1	you you and him
1	yeah that was from the back
1	that must have been about two thousand and seven or eight seven
1	about mm
1	i came up to that day conference about
1	yes pause dur short because you arrived early
1	texting
1	because you d already pause dur short you d already got out onto the front there hadn t you you were waiting by the car park trunc w trunc were you i think you were waiting by the twenty minute car park
1	i think you d got there early too but maybe waited somewhere else i m not sure well it all it all ended happily
1	we met up yeah
1	without any difficulties
1	was that when i you were at my house and i had i drove you
1	you drove me and dumped outside the er
1	dropped you in the university
1	yes and then i went to that day texting conference
1	and then when you finished you you just got down to the station didn t you cos you were quite near the station there
1	erm
1	i didn t i don t think i picked you up
1	no
1	i i can t remember if you walked or something
1	i got taxied or whatever
1	mm pause dur short cos we weren t quite sure when it was finishing
1	mm
1	i might have been at work or something
1	well we don t know don t know but that was all about pause dur short well how you use text messages
1	well that was a while ago
1	well no we still have text messages
1	no i mean when they first sort of came in
1	well it was about how you used them to get people to appointments cos people had started experimenting with students
1	oh like the
1	yes
1	doctors buzzing you and sending you more than you
1	i mean doctors didn t do those days
1	no well they overdo it now you get get two
1	oh
1	in rapid succession
1	oh mm well how you could have bought them and you d buy them in bulk the messages
1	yes
1	and then you send them out and i think they said that boys you know men
1	mm yes
1	students
1	yes
1	were four times as likely to come to their counselling interviews or their
1	yeah
1	you know
1	mm
1	having to see somebody i think we re talking about further education maybe but i don t know
1	yes
1	whatever if you sent them a text message to remind them
1	yes
1	than if you didn t which obviously helps because of the unclear wastes an awful lot of appointments i think girls were better i can t remember about girls
1	yeah pause dur short
1	the hospital s still sending fun messages that i think should be received on i think they re probably for a mobile phone but they erm send them out
1	thinking they re going to an iphone
1	well they don t know and they say press something and wait and oh and then they say we ll phone you again and they phone again
1	oh i just get a text message
1	oh
1	saying you ve got an appointment at trunc ei trunc at either your doctor or hospital is what the implication is they don t actually
1	oh
1	they don t send they re not particularly specific they re not
1	oh no
1	they re just general
1	anon type place
1	these are general unclear
1	yeah anon type place come from anon type place and the hospital definitely come from the hospital
1	yes pause dur short it s
1	and unclear
1	it s more like you have you have an appointment with a whichever trust it is you know
1	mm
1	or your gp so you ve got to remember which it is yourself to some extent it s not very clear pause dur short
1	i think it s a good idea in theory you have to get the timing right i think the trunc doc trunc the doctor s one oh the doctor s one always used to email as soon as you made the appointment
1	yes which is not it confirms you ve made it but it s not very helpful to unclear to remind me
1	and i m not sure now it might do it a day before or it might do it both but you see when i have my doctor phoning me she doesn t put an appointment in the system
1	no she does it off her own bat
1	i think she just writes a note on her desk to phone me
1	yeah
1	cos on a couple of occasions i phoned up to check about the timing
1	mm and nobody knew about it
1	and they said oh we ll just write the name down although she s very good at remembering who she has to phone but we ll add your name onto her list
1	yes pause dur short
1	but it s always worked she phoned here quite a lot in the summer didn t she
1	yes
1	which was very good of her pause dur short well i suppose we could try to resume activity in the kitchen
1	i was just thinking which
1	mm
1	erm hopefully we ll remember anon nametype m type name at work
1	mm
1	took my well i think and he should have my email address because
1	oh yes
1	he had it but he took my email address again so that when he sends anon nametype f type name notification of what work there is
1	oh yes
1	he can send me it
1	oh is that what happened last time
1	which might have when he didn t trunc e trunc no he didn t send me an email cos he didn t
1	no
1	know my thing and he he phoned me up
1	but did it not happen last time
1	no cos
1	but was he intending to send it but didn t have your email so he had to ask you separately
1	but anon nametype f type name always anon nametype f type name always used to ring me you see which is what he did
1	mm
1	or text me to ring her erm so i said reminded him that if he sent me an email i i was unlikely to have read it
1	email and text would be better wouldn t it
1	so i said if you send me an email can you just text to say you ve sent me an email
1	mm
1	which is what my neighbours do and then i ll make an effort to find a computer to look it up on
1	mm mm pause dur short
1	so it s not very helpful having emails
1	no but it s
1	unsolicited
1	it s better than not having the possibility of looking at the email at the same time isn t it
1	yes cos anon nametype f type name didn t anon nametype f type name kept texting me about other things but she didn t text me to say she d sent me that email
1	no well maybe she didn t think it was an action email
1	no but she d pause dur short
1	well i m going to switch off this recording now
1	and we better go and do something
1	yeah pause dur short
1	do something practical
1	yeah
1	yes
1	what do you think we might do
1	can you get out of that chair
1	yeah i can probably do it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i was just generally relaxing for a moment on the way
1	yes
1	so er let s have a look er that s what i ll do
0	mm
0	so i dunno she would like see her what like every maybe like three times a year two times a year sometimes one times a year one time sorry vocal desc misc all of a sudden from one day to the next after being at the anon nametype n type name s she would start calling it supper because anon nametype f type name called it supper because anon nametype f type name grew up she d never called it tea or dinner in her life she s always called it supper because her parents called it supper like it was just supper
0	get it out get it out
0	ah my god she s just like pause dur short she likes to feel i think that she likes the drama and she likes to feel sorry for herself and she likes to like unclear sollen unclear at the party she felt a little bit left out so she purposefully made herself
0	put herself out of this situation
0	when we go for trunc bar trunc when we used to go for barbecues you could see her and she would be like it was just so and she has that way of doing it like exactly that mannerism like going so and like sort of like pause dur short sucking her lips in a bit as if she s sucking them in
0	yeah
0	cos she got defensive cos she knew exactly what she were doing
0	pause dur short which doesn t happen any more that was back when i was a bit younger pause dur short erm going through my like rebellious stage pause dur short but erm vocal desc cough i hadn t mentioned it to my mum cos i knew what would happen and er i just went to england and it wasn t even me that brought it up it was my sister it was anon nametype f type name pause dur short she was like you know that face that mum does that really fucking pisses me off and she was like erm so

0	the more she picks them as

0	yeah i swear a lot

0	all based around curry
0	there is no smell left
0	where s your candle
0	you could clear a conference room you
1	so are trunc yo trunc are you enjoying this series of the sewing bee
1	vocal desc laugh erm yes in large part it s it s quite good entertainment but the some of the erm sewing is a bit er strange cos there s no kind of emphasis on the under finishing or anything like that cos it s just make it in the time
1	especially with the alteration challenge
1	yes which is you know fair enough they haven t got long but
1	mm
1	but some of them do seem a little on the ragged side and they do seem to use patterns
1	yes
1	you trunc kn trunc they do seem to follow a pattern rather than some of them ll modify patterns but er
1	i think this time i think in trunc prev trunc i think previously they had a direct make or something as a on a particular week
1	what do you mean
1	well they had to fit it directly on the person or they had to make a paper pattern i can t quite remember
1	mm
1	but there was something but there is one part i mean generally there s one part where they have to they re given a pattern and they have to make it up
1	yes
1	which is reasonable isn t it cos that s trunc s trunc sort of like a blind challenge
1	well it yes i mean they have been choosing their own patterns but and they had patterns for jackets and things but er you know some of the more simple stuff i suppose the er what do you call it the revamping things
1	mm
1	is a bit more
1	alteration challenge
1	the alteration challenge is a bit erm a bit different on that but er
1	they re sort of making something out of a pattern then aren t they although some people make their own paper one
1	yeah
1	but they tend to be a bit a lot of those tend to be more loose garments don t they
1	yes
1	mm but and er
1	and they can be a bit thrown together
1	yes
1	and sometimes they don t always seem to have the use the material that appropriately i don t think like
1	i think mum would have a few things to say about it cos they have a big piece of material
1	yes
1	and they just pin things all over the place on it
1	mm
1	and er mum was very good wasn t she about erm
1	oh yes well mum was a
1	er making sure it went together as trunc s trunc in small er small as small a space as possible
1	yes
1	but then it does depend on the pattern a bit doesn t it
1	what the printed the design
1	the trunc patt trunc your repeat like on
1	yes
1	wallpaper you have
1	yes
1	repeats then
1	well it does to some extent on the other hand what i haven t seen them doing particularly is opening the material out pause dur short erm and refolding it in a different way because mum used to refold her material so that you could get well you know one leg up one way and one leg up the other not put two legs following or something
1	oh right
1	you know so you would use
1	mm
1	so instead of getting a wasted bit in the middle
1	mm
1	if you well you had to put it against well no if you had to put it against the the er fold er against if you folded it in half to do it double to get the symmetrical shape
1	mm mm
1	well mum wouldn t fold it like they sort of seem to fold it in half and cut it against the fold so
1	yes
1	you get a big scrap along the bottom
1	mm mm
1	of the the selvedge er there whereas mum would only fold it as far down as she needed to cut the size so she d then have an extra piece of material that was double the size of the scrap they re getting
1	yes yes
1	and you could then put another piece in it so you could cut possibly one bit and then from the bit that was left over that wasn t folded
1	yes
1	she could cut the other bit flat you know refold it down the middle and
1	mm
1	cut out the one the other way by erm moving it up or moving it down slightly cos i remember at school when we used to get trunc s trunc erm told well we used to have to follow a pattern like the pyjamas we made stripy pyjamas i think i did get the material from school in that case but for example with similar things like that
1	mm
1	the pattern a proper shop bought pattern would say you need two yards
1	yes
1	erm mum would say you don t need trunc t trunc we we don t need to do it in two yards we can do it in
1	mm
1	a yard and a half or whatever it was and er we had to buy the patterns as well so mum used to pin the pattern on the material
1	yes
1	or show me where to pin it on the material
1	mm mm mm
1	erm and i d take it to school like that and then at school i would put it on more carefully you know she wasn t doing it all for me but she would show so i could show the teacher where the bits went
1	mm
1	but you didn t actually need that extra half a yard
1	yes
1	especially if you were buying some you know reasonably expensive material
1	and anyway it saves the pennies and that was important
1	and that was important but you see mum i mean mum was a tailoress really i know she did dressmaking but high standards cos she did make suits and well she made everything from the skin skin upwards
1	mm
1	outwards erm really cos in those in those days erm during during the war and trunc aft trunc after i mean they they made underwear and everything from
1	mm
1	if they could get a bit of parachute silk
1	mm
1	they d use that for underwear and ladies would go and buy a full matching set of something you know so they d have the the slip and the knickers and everything and then they d erm you know they would buy erm sort of an outfit
1	mm
1	trunc s trunc so mum could do all that and she could do i mean she that s what i mean she did tailoring in those days they had quite fitted jackets and things she could do tailoring and erm so on and being wartime those men s wise baggy trousers they used to have
1	mm
1	on suits if you got an old pair of trousers you could make a a decent skirt out of it cos you ve got
1	yes
1	four legs
1	mm
1	to play about with so you could cut it in a would it be a unclear you d certainly make a panelled a six panelled skirt or
1	mm
1	erm any of those sort of ones that you need seams in so erm she was dab hand at doing that from little bits of material and of course my friend anon nametype f type name was in her element when she was er came round because she loved sewing
1	mm
1	so mum and her would be patterning and looking at this that and the other sorting things out
1	did they make things together
1	er not really i don t think they actually made anything together but they talked about what they were doing
1	mm
1	i don t think she actually helped anon nametype f type name with anything and anon nametype f type name was pretty good at doing things so anon nametype f type name made a suede coat cos her father had got these erm skins
1	mm
1	from somewhere or other and erm anon nametype f type name made a suede coat when they were fashionable in the sixties
1	mm
1	you know with the covered buttons and everything and it looked perfectly decent which is quite a a lot for a sort of sixteen year old or so
1	yes
1	to take on
1	although one of those on the telly is trunc sixt trunc
1	yes she s not old is she
1	i think her name might be jade
1	yes
1	i don t think she s particularly old
1	no
1	and she was saying the best thing she d made was her prom dress
1	yeah
1	which looked particularly nicely made
1	well i think she s yes she s a later sort of
1	mm mm
1	teenager i think as well but you know anon nametype f type name was quite sort of confident about
1	mm
1	cutting this erm vocal desc laugh expensive stuff up and well trunc sh trunc you know you she used to run up things to wear at the dance
1	mm
1	or same as mum did for me cos i used to draw it and she used to make it
1	mm
1	but er
1	did you see things in magazines or shops how did you get your ideas or did you just do them you did you kind of know what people had and make one up
1	well i kind of saw bits of things i liked and made one up really
1	mm
1	erm cos i trunc kn trunc i well it s the same as now i never actually want to actually be wearing what everybody else is wearing
1	well you certainly don t do that anon nametype f type name
1	vocal desc laugh you know er i wouldn t just want to be looking like everybody else but i like to take the kind of the the theme and erm trunc m trunc plus mum had provisos cos was trunc wha trunc i was only er like i wasn t allowed to down to the dance till i was seventeen i think it as yes and er mum had provisos as to what i could actually have so as to how low the front was and you know well not how how trunc sh trunc short the skirt was to some extent although they were shorter skirts so erm you know there was that to consider so i did have some quite a few dresses that had quite er a low neckline at the back you know
1	mm
1	up to up to your bra strap which was quite erm daring
1	would you trunc d trunc you covered up in those days
1	yes which you didn t go you trunc d trunc definitely did didn t show your straps like they do now and if you ve got a if you ve got a sleeveless dress you would have little er little poppers and loops to put under your bra to keep it
1	mm
1	on your straps
1	mm mm i was looking at one er out of my summer clothing and wondering if i d sewn that kind of arrangement in because it s always a bit awkward
1	mm
1	when i or whether it came and i couldn t couldn t decide
1	no or or you would use erm a very little tiny gold pins
1	mm
1	erm as well they were useful and if you had a halterneck dress then you d you d have a a suitably shaped bra strap
1	yes you wouldn t wear over the shoulder straps
1	no no no
1	which people do now like that lady i was talking trunc t trunc telling you about on the train
1	yes oh i know
1	who had this sort of quite it was a sort of the first hot it was the trunc hotte trunc i should think it was the hottest day of the year
1	mm
1	so far and she had this sort of vesty top and this sort of padded erm foamy sort of big cup bra
1	like a wonderbra unclear
1	well i don t know do they push up i m not sure what a wonderbra does but
1	i i think it s supposed to enhance one s potential
1	but it trunc th trunc there s some that really look as though they re made of bits of erm foamy material that is sort of
1	yes
1	bent over
1	oh right
1	that sort of really er anyway it there was quite a trunc l trunc i could i could i could check it out quite carefully
1	yes
1	because of the way her her top trunc w trunc went
1	yes
1	erm
1	yes
1	mm
1	so
1	i can remember you had some er some of your dresses did you have a lot of pinky a silky looking one i don t think it was silky
1	it was
1	i think it was a new fabric
1	it was it was it was erm it could have been unclear tricel unclear
1	mm
1	and it it was a sort of apricot i suppose a pale apricot colour and that had a bit of sheen to it and was erm it was a fitted bodice it was sleeveless with a small er with a square neck but not too low
1	oh a square neck yes
1	it had a square neck er it was sleeveless and it came in under the it was fitted under the bust with a tiny band and that bodice was all erm it was ruched up it was lines of sewing and then pinched in to gather so it was all little ruches all the way over
1	oh
1	and it had the same binding on the erm edge of the sleeves and round
1	mm
1	er sleeve armholes
1	mm
1	and round the neck and it was square neck and the back and then it had a sort of a line skirt not gathered or anything it was just an a line as was per sixties
1	mm
1	and it was just a bit above the knee
1	are you thinking of a plain one or one with a swirly pattern on
1	no i m thinking of a plain one but
1	oh
1	the material had got a slightly erm kind of embossed it wasn t trunc shin trunc it wasn t so shiny it did have a slight textured embossed tiny little
1	mm
1	trunc sq trunc er think on it and i also because i had my short short hair with a backcombed bit i used to have a little bow i had a little trunc bl trunc bow on a clip
1	mm mm
1	in the same material
1	i always think of that being a a sort of a a kind of peachy orange actually
1	well it yes it wasn t sort of loud the loud one
1	mm
1	i had which you probably liked was the one with the swirly different colours it that was pinky purplely
1	oh with the belt
1	white er swirly things cos it was like psychedelic i m
1	oh no
1	the small
1	i was meant i was talking about
1	yes the small
1	yeah
1	i thought the small scale it s er small scale swirls
1	mm
1	and it was all sort of like it was was vocal desc laugh on the psychedelic era
1	with little white and grey and
1	and yes
1	pink and
1	and and pinky mauvey
1	and looking much nicer
1	swirly
1	unclear sounds
1	swirly things it sounds horrendous but er and that had that again was sleeveless erm with just a plain faced sleeve er underneath er er armhole underneath and it had a v neck
1	oh a v neck
1	trunc i trunc it had a v neck with a collar on it like a
1	oh
1	a flat
1	mm
1	a flat trunc n trunc not standing up like a shirt collar but like a flat a quite a small collar roll collar at the back but the ends of it were slightly er a little bit pointy not the unclear the every so long unclear points you sometimes got
1	mm
1	and then that was erm had erm darts and darts from the waist so the bodice was fitted erm and it had a it was waisted and it had erm i think it it wasn t it had a slightly flared skirt because it that again was erm was it it wasn t it might have been tricel there was another word for er it was a man made fibre but it didn t screw up or anything it was and it was thin
1	mm
1	it was very fine like a silky fine thin material
1	yes
1	er and it had a belt on it with a little buckle and the little pinky erm oblong curved it was it sort of it it was an oblong shape but it had a curve to it
1	mm
1	so it fitted against your waist and that was an old one of mum s from
1	oh
1	i don t know vocal desc laugh nineteen thirties or something that er went round it and that was quite quite short
1	mm
1	and again i had a i think i had a ribbon that time i had a erm ribbony thing that i could do into a bow in the same material and it was it was very bright but it was very nice
1	and you had one with a another belted one
1	and of course having said that it trunc ha trunc it did have a little pocket in it as well cos
1	oh
1	mother always tried to put a pocket in somewhere yes
1	and there was one for your cloakroom ticket
1	well well one would have one s handbag but
1	yes
1	for one s hanky
1	oh and you had another one with a belt didn t you er it had more sort of erm if it seemed a bit more like a shirt
1	oh
1	a purple purple and yellow and
1	no oh trunc n trunc are you thinking of the swirly one
1	not not the pink swirly one no erm
1	i can t think which one that was
1	oh
1	with a belt
1	but another one you had was like erm you had made nighties out of that erm slightly furry fabric
1	furry fabric
1	er you know like like the trunc y trunc trunc y trunc you ve got that apricot long nightie
1	what was that
1	well it had little stripes across
1	brushed nylon
1	brushed nylon is that what you call it
1	yes
1	it was like a big t shirt with those pearl buttons on it
1	oh i know what you mean yes yes
1	and they had lots of different colours
1	er yes that was a slightly velvety effect
1	was that brushed nylon or am i rude about it
1	with a printed erm well it s kind of like that but it was had a slightly erm velvety but it it was a kind of stretchy material and it was like a erm a big t shirt only not like they wear now that s flappy with the off the shoulder it was erm a properly fitted your size erm trunc s trunc er like the top of a t shirt erm but it had erm an oval sort of neck and it had a little placket with buttons i think at the front or
1	mm mm
1	and then erm it went carried on but it was quite narrow it wasn t a flappy t shirt it was quite fitted on the hips narrow and short and it had got a sort of wavy a wavy pattern
1	mm
1	it wasn t a swirly one it was a wavy pattern
1	mm
1	and it was green and vocal desc laugh orange and yellow and but it was very thin
1	yes it was very pretty
1	lines it was very pretty and it it was quite a a clingy
1	mm
1	type thing and then i of course the fashion came in cos those were kind of unclear oh unclear trunc s trunc i m talking sixty seven sixty eight kind of era and then erm also knitted dresses the well crocheted
1	mm
1	trunc d trunc dresses erm but you could also have a knitted dress with a holey pattern in a crocheted pattern in and it wasn t too holey and erm it had scallop crochet round the end and it was just like a erm pause dur short i suppose like a a shift you know it was just erm it was just like a a vesty top only with a higher boat neck slightly cut in erm armholes and erm straight and thin erm just and it had scalloping round the edges and it was like erm pause dur short not navy blue a trunc sor trunc a warmer colour than that sort of midnight blue and of course it was very holey you re supposed to have tassels round the bottom but i never got the tassels and i had scallops instead and there was a twisted wool belt thing
1	mm
1	and you tie round but it was it was a bit holey so mum made a lining for it
1	mm
1	so i had a lined one cos she didn t
1	mm
1	think it was quite the thing
1	no
1	to go round showing your holes through the skin through the holes so erm i had this lining which was it was lining material and it was very sort of erm er it was a what would you call it erm i can t think of the name it was like a satin it got a sheen on it it was the same colour
1	oh right mm
1	as the dress but got a bit of a sheen so
1	mm
1	when the light caught it it was quite
1	mm
1	pretty in the holes and it also kept the shape of the dress better cos some people s vocal desc laugh some people s crocheted dresses tended to sort of grow with them or
1	mm
1	get longer and things vocal desc laugh bit like possibly a bit like knitted swimming costumes of the early fifties
1	i think you did well not to have the tassels i think they re much overrated
1	yes
1	i m not sure tassels would have looked very nice on it i think scallop was
1	mm
1	was probably better
1	i always fancied one of those dresses that had that has erm possibly three or four inch er fringe that layers of fringe
1	mm oh yes
1	you now those
1	somebody made one on one of the sewing bees i think didn t they
1	yes layers of fringe
1	mm
1	so so it shakes about and you don t have to move much although i used to move quite a lot but you know vocal desc laugh
1	mm mm
1	erm yes and and then what else do you remember do you remember my camel and green
1	oh yes
1	now
1	more a day dress wasn t it
1	yes camel and green was camel and green was erm one of mother s creations thinking of erm er challenges for alterations pause dur short i think i think the camel started off was going to be a pair of camel trousers
1	mm
1	for me
1	yes
1	because they were the thing at the time
1	mm
1	er cos this would have been er when did i go to college this would have been late sixties erm and it was if of the era of the two tone
1	yes
1	er so i thought i d have this winter erm camel trousers but i don t know they didn t seem to be right so mum took them apart i mean she d made them sort of very well but they just didn t seem to look right on me
1	no
1	erm she d fitted them you know when once they were
1	you did have your
1	fitted
1	pantomime horse trousers didn t you later on
1	well this is it yes they were they were corduroy trousers that looked like vocal desc laugh the back of a pantomime horse even though i wasn t quite that broad across the unclear beam unclear anyway er mum
1	i think that was part of the problem actually
1	yes
1	wasn t it
1	yes mum er we had this pair of trousers and they must have been reasonably straight trousers er and mum made this panelled dress for me it was military style and it had bottle green trunc s trunc long sleeves in fine wool erm er quite a fitted sleeve and it had a a yoke that was erm that had two points down along the front
1	mm
1	so it looked kind of a bit like a back of a military jacket front and back
1	mm
1	so that was a bottle green and then the rest of it was these trousers so where the point of the bodice came the yoke came there was a an over sewn seam down each side and and at the back which also did the fitting for the front
1	mm
1	because you only needed narrow panels
1	mm
1	and because it was a shorter dress you could get it out of the trouser length
1	mm mm
1	erm so that was my camel and green and i wore it for my college interview
1	oh and very appropriate for a
1	yes
1	unclear interview
1	and erm as i say erm i think anon nametype f type name not so long back mentioned the camel and green cos you know as a creation it had a long zip down the back
1	mm mm
1	that was one of mum s things and then i had erm there was that very nice it was a long dress was it i think it was a long dress originally the one in the little pattern that your work bag your er sewing bag is lined in
1	oh yes
1	that was a pretty one but
1	well we all had those long skirts didn t we
1	yes well this was a dress with a erm a square sort of piece and it had not lace round it
1	mm mm
1	a square erm bit on the front erm yoke sort of erm a square thing and slightly puffed sleeves and long sleeves erm cuffs long cuffs long sleeves and it had grandma s lace round it
1	oh yes
1	that lace was nanny anon nametype n type name s lace just a tiny bit let in cos it was the same colour as that was a laura ashley type fabric
1	mm
1	little showery things and then mum shortened that for me i think
1	i had a long skirt that eventually got shortened
1	mm but
1	i i m i i m i m wearing on the er driving test trunc photogra trunc
1	yeah oh right
1	you know when i got back when i passed my
1	mm
1	driving test in nine seventy nine
1	yes
1	so it would have been you know a few years later then
1	yes and mum made lots of different skirts unclear kilt erm you know just plain a line and unclear
1	i had to wear
1	all sorts
1	your red skirt to a party i went to when i was about thirteen
1	yes
1	anon nametype f type name s party
1	yeah
1	at anon type place
1	what red skirt
1	we had to go out and buy a jumper cos i didn t have anything at all suitable to go going to
1	oh
1	a party in
1	mm what red skirt was that i can t trunc reme trunc
1	i don t remember it other than that
1	oh
1	but it wasn t my skirt so you
1	oh
1	it must have been
1	i don t remember having a red skirt
1	obviously it was very short on you and i was a bit shorter because i was younger
1	yes can t remember what one that was now
1	can t remember if it had buttons on or not we had those both had blue and red dresses
1	mm
1	with erm buttons on because yours
1	oh yes that s right
1	was quite subtle and mine was rather bright
1	yes yes
1	i m not sure i really liked it but erm
1	i think mine was a slightly darker navy
1	mm
1	oh and i remember in earlier days well earlier days probably sixty seven erm pause dur short in the era of erm pause dur short trunc hip trunc hipster skirts i had that sort of wasn t purple it was more a dark violet coloured one with a wide belt and it trunc ha trunc it had father s army ex army trunc sur trunc you know doing his military service wartime brass belt that i had
1	oh
1	on the front and that was very short
1	mm
1	and it was before tights came in
1	oh
1	so you wore stockings
1	mm
1	so and you had erm they were like erm erm lacy sort of openwork erm creamy colour was very popular
1	mm
1	and you had the creamy colour
1	mm
1	stockings and the shorter skirt which took some manoeuvring and then i had a creamy trunc t trunc colour sort of slightly openwork jumper i used to wear
1	mm
1	tucked in
1	mm
1	you know and then and it was the era of the pale lipstick as well the mascara and the pale lipstick and the backcombed hair yes i remember wearing that the trouble is some of these little skirts and i thought oh that s quite nice material and i couldn t get into them some years later and i unpicked them cos i thought they might nice material
1	mm mm mm
1	make a cushion or something
1	yes
1	which i didn t which is a shame because erm you know these things come round again and there was very some very nice erm like trunc pl trunc
1	you still might not fit into them
1	i know very nice plaid er erm not plaid check material well there were some plaid we used to have some quite bright plaid ones erm and there was a bluey yellowy one and we used to get or mum used to help knit as well we used to knit a matching trunc jum trunc a jumper
1	yes
1	that knitted matches
1	yes
1	the the knitted erm with some sort of little erm pause dur short detail on it that erm went with one of the colours so it was
1	mm
1	like an outfit
1	i think you re wearing one of those but trunc pl trunc trunc br trunc quite bright plaid skirts on one of the first photographs we were in colour in
1	mm
1	in the garden
1	yes
1	because all the colours came out quite strange in those days on
1	yes
1	photographs
1	yes
1	but i think from when they were made not just
1	yes
1	gone off trunc af trunc afterwards
1	no pause dur short yeah of course kilts were in fashion cos we used to buy children s kilts when we were kids
1	mm
1	unclear
1	i had a red one from marks and spencer s and you had a whitish one didn t you
1	mm
1	er well white background with
1	yeah
1	colours on
1	oh yes mine was a navy navy and white
1	mm
1	with a red line through i used to know what names these were but i ve forgotten
1	i don t think i knew that they had names in those days
1	yes
1	cos i had mine when i was little
1	mm but well i used to have a kilt when i was little as well but in fact i have the pin vocal desc laugh i still have the pin that i put in my
1	mm
1	older ones but er yes but er still
1	so you didn t have a dress erm a sixties dress like those ones that they were calling colour block dresses
1	colour block dress
1	it looked like mondrian dresses
1	yeah the mondrian ones no i didn t have one of those i didn t want one of those cos they were everywhere
1	oh were they
1	yeah erm i well trunc th trunc there used to be a lot of black and white dresses pause dur short and black and white was a thing and there was and there were also those ones with colour in i think trunc sh trunc anon nametype f type name had anon nametype f type name had one i remember erm don t remember anon nametype f type name having one but i kind of missed out on those black and white
1	that would be really more a mondrian wouldn t it
1	with the colour in yes
1	mm
1	erm anon nametype f type name had some shoes that were black and white pause dur short two tone you know
1	yeah two tone
1	erm that was a music style as well two tone
1	i think that s rather different rather later
1	yes but it no it erm pause dur short yeah it was it was early
1	unclear always think about this midlands bands
1	yes those midlands bands but like erm they re very much like erm ska
1	mm
1	type of music pause dur short but er and anon nametype f type name and er not anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name
1	yes
1	had er mary quant hairstyles they cos they were always going up to london buying oh i ve forgotten what they re called those boots that had sort of holes rouleau loops and holes in them
1	oh
1	in unclear all had those
1	yes
1	and and even had some shoes made at was it anello and davide
1	really
1	yeah cos
1	gosh that was quite a posh thing to do to have
1	it is
1	shoes made
1	it was quite posh they had erm because they were like erm i don t know whether they were like quite like granny shoes they were sort of plain ones with buttons with a strap and button over
1	oh right are they called mary janes now those ones
1	er
1	with a little
1	they had a little heel they were much more delicate a bit like more like my unclear minnie moochers unclear
1	mm
1	type of shoes erm and then erm they decided they were gonna have their hair cut
1	mm
1	and anon nametype f type name had got blonde and anon nametype f type name had got dark hair and they had one of those off centre mary quant with the sort of the point that s sort of over an eyebrow at a slant and then at the back you get a point down one side short haircuts they re all
1	oh
1	off off off trunc a trunc asymmetric maybe that s the right word
1	mm mm
1	and erm
1	not just wonky you mean
1	no they were
1	vocal desc laugh
1	designed like that
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but you have to have a really good cut for it to keep falling in the right place i think anon nametype f type name had hers going going one way and anon nametype f type name had the other trunc s trunc way
1	yes
1	you know they didn t have identical they had erm a matching trunc p trunc pair i d forgotten about that yes as well so they had those i remember that i can t remember i think they had them done in london i can t remember
1	gosh
1	but er
1	i expect it would cost a fortune to go up to london these days and have your hair cut
1	yeah
1	it s although i mean perhaps it s no more expensive than having it cut in the trunc cen trunc in the centre of anon type place which could be expensive enough
1	yeah pause dur short mind you anon nametype f type name s dad had an account at harrods for his suits
1	really
1	unclear
1	so perhaps they were quite used to spending quite a lot because
1	yeah
1	i mean i can t imagine mum or dad
1	no
1	doing that
1	well if you remember anon nametype f type name s had two older sisters so she was the young one so her parents were quite old
1	mm
1	comparatively you know
1	mm
1	trunc f trunc for the time erm there was a bit of a gap between she was the last one cos i remember going on their end of year outing as it were
1	mm
1	up to london in in anon nametype m type name s erm little well it was a mini but it was customised with a slopey back erm
1	that sounds quite tricky being in a
1	anon nametype f type name
1	cut down mini
1	unclear well it s an old mini you know it s not
1	mm
1	one of these great tanks
1	no no no
1	it was a little mini
1	i had a little mini i know little minis
1	i know yes
1	there s not a lot of space but
1	no
1	on that occasion we did manage to get six or seven people in in it
1	mm
1	for reasons that erm pause dur short that must have been nineteen
1	mm
1	nineteen ninety because that was on the occasion of dad marrying anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name was sixty so that
1	yeah must have been yeah anyway we went up to london
1	sorry i interrupt
1	in this in this thing i was gonna say we went up to london in this thing and we parked in the underground car park i can t remember where that was it wasn t marble arch i don t think so we were going along and all of a sudden we d zoomed down this underground car park erm i can t think where it was now and erm we went and had lunch in harrods cos he was going to order a suit
1	mm
1	and had a look round harrods
1	mm i did exactly the same thing in london because i went down to london with anon nametype m type name s parents
1	yes
1	and anon nametype m type name s father worked at anon type place cos anon type place had offices at anon type place so we were
1	yes
1	and that s just off oxford street or somewhere like that
1	yes
1	well presumably somewhere in the centre
1	well i could have been park lane this underground car park
1	mm
1	we were going along and all of a sudden
1	yeah
1	where are we going vocal desc laugh
1	and you re out busy in oxford street or regent street or something
1	yes
1	and then suddenly you end up in in at underground in a car park on a day when the car park was mostly empty because you know the workers weren t using it
1	oh it was his works car park
1	yeah yes he
1	yeah
1	it was a anon type place
1	yeah
1	where he worked
1	ah
1	i guess he must have driven down every day to have access to it
1	yes
1	erm
1	i i know anon nametype m type name stayed in a hotel very near there
1	mm
1	that had an underground car park cos he s he pause dur short you know he thought it was like journey to the centre of the earth this
1	mm mm mm
1	thing cos he said i wouldn t have been able to i wouldn t have erm been vocal desc laugh you d have to blindfold me i wouldn t have been able to go down there it was awful
1	mm
1	but he he didn t go very trunc oft trunc he he decided it wasn t they it was too it cost too much for him to drive down there and pay parking all week so they used to send him on the train but er yes i remember something like that so i suppose if land s at a premium you just have to park your car down
1	well yes yes
1	downstairs as it were yeah
1	and anon nametype m type name and well the anon nametype n type name s were pause dur short anon nametype m type name and his father anyway on that occasion wanted to go off and see some presumably london football match
1	yeah
1	and anon nametype m type name s mum went shopping and i went shopping
1	yes pause dur short oh
1	i suppose anon nametype m type name s brother was there somewhere too
1	mm
1	gosh that was a long time ago was it
1	yes i remember anon nametype m type name s mum
1	i mean they probably don t do the same thing now with parking because otherwise you d have to go through the congestion charge every day probably wouldn t you
1	yeah i suppose so unless was he a government department have they got
1	no no no
1	some special
1	anon type place he worked for anon type place
1	oh anon type place that s right yes
1	he worked on patents
1	i don t know
1	it s er it s anon nametype m type name s brother who s er worked for the anon type place
1	right oh pause dur short well well there we are
1	yeah shall we erm have a will if you ve got time shall we have a look at the beginning of the sewing bee cos
1	we could do
1	we didn t see all of it yesterday
1	mm
1	shall we trunc d trunc shall we have a go at doing that now
1	we could do that yes i haven t actually heard back from my friend erm anon nametype f type name the great sewer who er if she s been watching that programme
1	mm
1	be interesting to hear what she thought about it
1	yes perhaps it doesn t appeal to sewers i don t know
1	i don t know
1	it s quite good spectator sport and i found on the early ones erm they seemed a bit more informative i think it was having that person who was more of a teacher as the other judge
1	yes
1	cos i m sure i sort of learnt things or thought about things
1	mm
1	whereas i don t really get the same i don t enjoy that new judge the
1	mm
1	female judge
1	no
1	as much as the other lady
1	no but the man s quite funny
1	he he is he is actually coming out to be really quite a character on it
1	yes
1	he seemed a bit erm standoffish in the first series
1	yeah mind you i mean it is to some extent it is erm depends how much you know about the subject because i i i used to pause dur short get quite a little irks about the the pottery throw down
1	on yes
1	and what they were doing
1	yes yes
1	i think what are they doing you know technique wise vocal desc laugh like should er vocal desc laugh you know no if you do that it s it s bound to warp
1	mm
1	and things you know vocal desc laugh but
1	mm but all these things with the baking things they re not making it i mean the everybody who is on the bake off like the the the the erm not that cr me de la cr me one but the other one
1	mm ordinary
1	they can all make cakes well
1	yes
1	it s just if they can make cakes under time pressure

1	yes her whatsit s sticking her finger in it
1	yes
1	yes yes
1	erm and it s kind of it s it s it s it s all very different environment then
1	yeah
1	do you remember on the sewing bee the erm pause dur short the erm the woman who was deaf
1	no i ve only seen this series
1	oh have you oh
1	i didn t see any of the well i only saw a brief bit of one the earlier series
1	mm
1	and i can t think what they were doing i think they were making a shopping bag or something i don t know
1	yes they did they did
1	i think that was the only one
1	yeah
1	i saw
1	they probably try and make it a bit more difficult and more varied each time
1	yes
1	erm but oh she was quite funny because she would always have a joke with erm er the guy
1	yes
1	judge and she would say oh he makes my heart beat you know he she used to do her
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	sign language
1	yeah
1	she she was a
1	vocal desc laugh
1	teaching assistant thing it s like oh he makes and her her trunc s trunc her trunc s trunc her sign for him would be doing her
1	vocal desc laugh oh right yeah
1	vocal desc gasp making her heart flutter
1	vocal desc laugh
1	which was quite funny because you know that was quite erm
1	yes
1	er i mean that it you know that was quite daring with him because he was very standoffish in those days
1	yes yes yes
1	whereas now he d be part of it he says things like oh i d like to wear that outfit
1	oh yes those purple trousers
1	in yes yes
1	yeah
1	anyway trunc l trunc let s
1	yeah
1	let s have a go at looking at this then
1	yes have a little
1	okay event desc abrupt end
0	i was going to say go on youtube and like try some of the self tutorials i ve tried some of those and like if i watch it i can do it but then as soon as i go away or shut down the youtube video or something unclear forget everything

0	no
0	it s really annoying though cos i used to love it and like but it was different in england like the way they did the music classes like it was so different because when i took up drums when i trunc li trunc when i came here erm quite a few years ago now like i still had to do the note reading next to it and it was two separate classes so it was an hour of drum lessons in a week and then another hour of reading music like sheet music
0	i just found it stupid i understand for things where you need to read music but it s like the drum sheet music you had like three colours it was the same principle like the ones that were black was one beat the ones that were white in the middle two beats like et cetera et cetera was the same thing
0	mm
0	and i was just like i don t need to sit through an hour vocal desc laugh but like i really hated the teacher as well he looked like an owl and he had like a monobrow and he was so cruel and i d never practice because i fucking hated it like literally i d dread that lesson and it would he d put on like one of those metronome things
0	and you d have to read it and then bit by bit you d have to sing so that you d learn to recognise it and i know that s a really good skill to have but it pissed me off so much i stopped pause dur short

0	yeah
0	yeah anon nametype f type name and i have a similar kind of
0	yeah i do all the money and the you know
0	you must have lived quite frugally in those two years
0	no we did we did live pretty frugally i ve lived frugally since since uni
0	yeah
0	so fifteen grand each
0	so you were thirty grand
0	we had thirty grand between us but we put down so i ll just talk about my money cos anon nametype f type name s done exactly the same i had fifteen i put down six thousand on the on one year s tuition for the ma
0	i ve already whacked them about seven grand on the rent that s paid eight months up front
0	yeah
0	like i need i need this money from this job
0	yeah yeah basically
0	yeah but when we go to saudi after this apparently we can save double what we were saving in korea in saudi
0	so i could i could save about fifteen grand in one year
0	yeah
0	yeah exactly yeah
0	mm
0	yeah yeah because it s more wanted it s more desired
0	but i didn t rake in much extra
0	no
0	yeah taking that job so that wasn t like a big pay cut
0	and we re gonna do a year here and then and then try and get to saudi i guess or somewhere
0	yeah and that s therefore you re getting married
0	yeah
0	yes i know there was a bin there was a bin
0	i couldn t
0	just in case it went wrong vocal desc laugh

0	it s just easier
0	so i m getting paid
0	oh right
0	and they owe me we get a bonus month s pay
0	in korea it s like labour law so you do twelve months
0	oh really
0	it s like their labour law saudi does it as well so it s pretty useful
0	vocal desc laugh right
0	every single time and that s a bit annoying so if we had a joint bank account right now they could potentially put mine and anon nametype f type name s money in one bank account and we only get charged once
0	you know what i mean

0	yeah
0	because i think i ve told you before they all go to like private schools and stuff
0	so basically the students consider that private that public school isn t really worth your time you know you learn the real stuff in private school like after hours public school is just day care we re just looking after the children so they
0	that is too much like there s only so much your brain can absorb
0	no absolutely
0	you know there s a there s a limit
0	no yeah did i tell you the time i had my first ever time i invigilated exams was in my high school and we were doing the english exam and i was put with the head of english
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	i trunc th trunc yeah just pretending
0	vocal desc laugh
0	did you really
0	yeah yeah definitely i m enjoying it i haven t had a kronen but you can t get these in korea
0	i do like a kronen
0	actually that s a lie
0	more recently they ve started stocking them but i mean you re gonna pay like two pound a can for
0	but this can cost like two pound fifty for one carrot
0	i m finding in england it s fairly fixed like year round but it changes a little bit
0	the massive potato famine
0	oh my god i thought i actually thought of you i thought if anon nametype m type name was in england now he d be going spare over the price of potatoes vocal desc laugh
0	which is a bargain an absolute bargain
0	yeah it is i was actually quite impressed because of how expensive korea was
0	you could get like a
0	beyond the train station and then we don t have very good access to supermarkets
0	we have to go all the way down the hill i thought we did when i stuck it on a map but when you actually walk there s kind of things in the way
0	er erm anon type place
0	oh no don t trunc both trunc don t bother
0	and then we took a turn and there s like a sainsbury s erm an aldi
0	and another one i can t remember what it s called
0	yeah so if i was you and lived here and didn t have a car or anything i would probably consider doing my shopping online
0	yeah i considered that what s it like shopping online
0	yeah
0	get the fresh produce there
0	yeah
0	yeah and it it s really accessible i mean the only times you won t want to cycle to uni is if it s pissing it down
0	mate before you came back it s been lovely
0	the weather s been so good
0	no exactly that
0	no it s all good i ve only got four mate
0	oh have you oh i trunc co trunc can always pop
0	it s not as easy as it sounds
0	you know i don t mine er it being a bit tipsy or whatever
0	yeah yeah
0	vocal desc misc
0	no pause dur short no definitely not
0	so you get a certain amount of antenatal courses free on the nhs we didn t do those erm we basically paid a hundred and eighty quid for this course
0	what can they teach you
0	well what can they teach you that the nhs one isn t gonna do
0	oh yeah no no i vocal desc laugh i think if you think about it a hundred and eighty quid for two people to go on a two full day course with one evening
0	that s a good deal
0	yeah definitely what kind of things did you learn then
0	well you ll probably be better off coming back here to have kids wouldn t you anyway
0	do you wanna have kids then
0	a part of us definitely does like both anon nametype f type name and i like to experience things and having a child is a pretty big experience
0	it s well it s the ultimate one that
0	yeah it s massive
0	yeah and it s a massive experience and nothing else covers it so we ve discussed it and we kind of think maybe if we get to like forty i think
0	yeah
0	mm
0	er but she d got artificially inseminated
0	so then i guess we ve decided that at that point we may just adopt i think
0	and then you you you basically have an agreement
0	it ll never get off the ground vocal desc laugh
0	so i don t think er i don t know if we will have children then cos
0	we haven t got enough years basically we re actually
0	yeah
0	mm
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	rather than just being a professor that doesn t know how to teach you know what i mean
0	some people they go from school to masters to phd without ever getting any work experience
0	basically but he was a doctor well within
0	and he s fucking so intelligent
0	he s already a research fellow
0	it s crazy
0	the plan is if we can get a foot in the door with canada or america and we can spend three or four years and they have quite a bit of funding out there
0	or like as a foreign student you can get even more funding opportunities
0	erm if we can get a three or four year foot in the door it s only another year to get a fairly solid green card which would mean that anon nametype f type name and i basically want dual citizenship somewhere
0	anon nametype f type name and i aren t if we re every gonna get on the property ladder
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	you know what i mean nothing bigger than here
0	so it would be maybe canada or america
0	i m visiting my friends in tennessee and like some of the houses they showed me were like a hundred thousand dollars and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
0	yeah
0	like about twenty years ago and he s lived he s got a massive house and it s like with quite a bit of land
0	and stuff so it was like he said he was like i couldn t afford to move back to england now
0	no
0	it s crazy isn t it yeah
0	my friend s just bought my friend s father has just bought five hundred the size of five hundred american football fields worth of land in kentucky
0	no it doesn t exist
0	mm
0	yeah
0	i d really like to live in like argentina or something
0	well they re not like the best relations with the uk either vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	cheap cocaine as well
0	yeah
0	mm
0	and they basically told me they wouldn t accept it that it had to be from a native english speaking country
0	so the same with our phd we couldn t do one in argentina therefore the only way we get a foot in the door is by working there for numerous years but the pay is so low
0	in latin america it s terrible
0	yeah
0	i d love to teach in these places
0	oh really
0	yeah exactly
0	no that s really true
0	so i have to i have to work where i can save

0	and i m like what what do i do with this
0	yeah well what did he do that for
0	cos they wanted to work in america and they had worked in america like everyone i met pretty much

0	not really big or anything
0	i stepped a foot on it and the guy shouted at me in spanish pulled out a shotgun and he said that s private

1	and was that particularly successful
1	well the first one i think was alright yeah
1	good
1	but erm
1	has he had an artificial joint put in
1	yeah
1	god amazing
1	it is isn t it isn t it you you think knees are really complicated i don t know i expect they are but erm he s had one done and he s having the other one done it s amazing and it s and at er anon type place somewhere
1	yeah
1	i asked her i said is is it anon type place because that s where my father died and er she said no i don t think so she said it s a new hospital
1	anon type place
1	anon type place in anon type place that s where
1	that s where your father died
1	yeah
1	really
1	yeah he had a
1	is that
1	he had a brain operation he had
1	oh
1	yeah it s there was apparently no hope and it s it was cancer brain cancer and i think it spread everywhere there s no hope erm erm the last time i saw him he was lying in bed there with a bandaged head the last time
1	oh i m sorry
1	yeah oh well but erm it s not the same hospital erm so yeah and catching up on er on everybody mm and erm i asked about erm you know that er dbs thing trunc w trunc with police and i said three times i ve emailed the woman er about er you know expunging that record and i got no reply they re just ignoring me i don t and i don t know what
1	well they re probably not there to er she s a policewoman is she
1	i think so or she might be might just work in the office i don t know
1	amazing
1	but you d think they d reply i know she only came back from holiday last week but after a week you know
1	well some things never get expunged and that s it
1	well okay but at least they had the would have the decency to reply
1	decency yeah well if they were decent people they wouldn t become policemen would they
1	vocal desc laugh
1	let s be honest there s more corruption and unclear
1	well anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name used to work in er work er in the police i mean she wasn t a policewoman
1	no
1	but she she worked for them you know erm and i said have you have you still got any contacts and she said well i have but i trunc d trunc don t know if you know but i ll sort of send him an email and find out and it s funny that just er as we were finishing our conversation and we were just about to go and just about saying goodbyes my phone rang and it was anon nametype f type name so i erm vocal desc laugh i d finished talking with anon nametype f type name and quickly said you know event desc sound of kissing and bye bye er you know and nice to see you blah blah blah and and then i had to continue the conversation with anon nametype f type name and er
1	right
1	she said about er she said i should try and trunc fi trunc phone anon type place cos you know it was anon nametype f type name that actually took my my form there to anon type place to erm so erm she said oh i ll try and get the phone number and er and phone them up i said well er i can try so maybe tomorrow i ll try and track down anon type place and police phone anon type place phone number and try and track this woman down and try and get something done about it pause dur short
1	well good luck
1	well thank you very much
1	you re welcome
1	yeah so unclear phoning anon nametype f type name was that you know i was asking about it and she mentioned that the money is a bit tight and i said well doesn t she get the pension i said cos when we got divorced er when i went down there we went to this er pension office because when when you re self employed in france you have to pay erm
1	a stamp
1	well yes the equivalent of a stamp and erm er well like national insurance er for a pension but it s er erm and you have to all all the obligatory things that you have to pay er and it s all tied to your trunc tur trunc declared turnover
1	right
1	so when i was last saw her when i was last in anon type place when i went down there for the divorce erm we went together to this er place and i signed over my right to the pension for her
1	right
1	because i mean i thought it s the least i could do trunc b trunc seeing that it was my fault that you know she s in the situation she was alone and as and i was earning good money you know at university and i thought well that s the least i could do and anon nametype f type name really surprised me when she said she hasn t received a penny or rather a euro
1	so how old is anon nametype f type name
1	well she must be about er trunc fif trunc what is it nineteen fifty two she s or fifty four it was fifty four and she ll be sixty now won t she
1	so when do women in france get their pensions
1	i don t know i don t know i d and i said well that s crazy because you know she should have been receiving quite good money because of all the years the eighteen years that we paid into this
1	yeah but if you haven t er
1	well i haven t
1	reached retirement age there she won t get anything surely
1	but women always retire earlier don t they i mean what is it sixty is it trunc si trunc trunc six trunc sixty
1	yeah but here it s gone up
1	is it sixty
1	it may have gone up there
1	well maybe maybe but er i might and that s that s what i wanted to talk to her about you know trunc t trunc to find out why she hasn t received this and what what she s has done or hasn t done to try and get it erm but she s too tired so i ll i ll phone them tomorrow afternoon but er i might have to go down there er which will be a nice excuse to go to to go to anon type place you know cos i can get cheap
1	unclear
1	well i can get cheap flights now erm i m on anon nametype f type name s erm trunc f trunc list you know for erm you know if you worked for i ve starting doing it now have you noticed saying you know you know er she has been working for anon type place for over twenty years and they have they re allowed to nominate two people pause dur short for erm concessions they have a concession
1	yes
1	and you get standby flights and you get them really cheaply like when i came back from china
1	yes
1	sixty quid
1	yes
1	it cost me more to pay for my second bag
1	yes
1	than it did for the flight back
1	yes
1	so i i can
1	unbelievable
1	i know isn t it but erm i trunc c trunc i could so i could get a cheap flight down there and try and sort out this business about pensions pause dur short so that s what i was just trying to phone her about but er so afterwards so after we finished chatting er i went to anon type place to find out where this language school is so i i knew where it would be for my appointment at half past three
1	yes
1	and it was i i went through the arcade and when you get the outside the other trunc arc trunc er the the other end of the arcade right in front of me this huge poster language school and i thought okay right so then i came back here and got changed and went down there er for an interview a very friendly dos
1	yes
1	erm lovely lady and er she s only been doing the job for a few weeks
1	yes
1	and cos i ve done that job twice you know before director of studies and er she was er she was the one it is quite a small school but erm er she was all unclear they do ielts preparation down there and of course that s my speciality you know and er she said well now i ve got the dos s job responsibilities i i ve had to er handover teaching ielts to somebody else and she said you would be perfect for that you know so erm we spoke for oh it must have been about forty minutes
1	mm
1	and basically er it s to start with and i i didn t really expect any more actually but er they they don t know from one week to another how many students they ve got and she said she said i think i m she does it on thursday her schedule for the following week and she said is that alright and if i just phone you up and say well can you do this or can you do that and i said yeah i said er because it would be good to get back into the swing of teaching again you know cos er i haven t taught for a few months and er to do something positive the the pay is pretty low but just to to get back into it would be good and obviously you know to to get out and meet people you know as well as you know teaching so unusual afternoon really
1	mm
1	and er quite positive in some ways pause dur short yeah so er you had a nice relaxing afternoon didn t you
1	yeah i suppose so
1	you mean you mean you didn t
1	it s very tiring
1	oh i know you were absolutely exhausted pause dur short it must be accumulation that s been building up for some time and it s not just er from one day to the next there s a there s a
1	possibly i don t know
1	i m sure no i m sure i mentioned to you last night you know and you seem really wound up like a spring you know all tension there but you see
1	was i
1	yeah lately and you seem much more relaxed today
1	well it s probably diet that s what it is
1	do you reckon
1	yeah yeah sure yeah diet with with erm with er diabetics
1	well you only you only started it today will it take effect already
1	well look how quickly a drink takes effect but it s it s just stuff you put in your body isn t it
1	or don t
1	what
1	or don t put in your body
1	or don t er put in your body that s it isn t it i mean
1	yeah
1	camomile tea was a good idea
1	here s here s to your your diet
1	oh yes cheers
1	cheers
1	pause dur short ah
1	i think you re a very brave chap doing all three things that are more or less at the same time giving up smoking giving up drinking more unclear vocal desc laugh i ll drink to that vocal desc laugh well to to all intents and purposes
1	yes thank you
1	and erm and now your your diet but you re it s it s it s not only wise i mean it s more than wise it s absolutely necessary isn t it especially the diet
1	but i think one of the biggest things is stopping smoking
1	was it
1	and the next one is diet and the next one is drinking
1	well
1	those are the orders i m i m putting it in difficulty for me
1	yeah you re you re into your third week now of giving up smoking
1	i quite liked smoking
1	yeah i know but you haven t made a big deal of it
1	unclear and it does choke me up and it makes me feel depressed and it makes me get stomach gives me erm indigestion and there s lots of things that smoking does that i really don t like
1	mm mm
1	so but it s the thing that i do enjoy smoking
1	mm
1	but erm
1	but you you don t
1	but then again i don t and there s too many things that i when i smoke it depresses me it s depressing
1	yeah you you don t usually do things in half measures do you you whatever you do you usually put everything into it and that includes the vices as well as work and and and
1	yes you could say that
1	virtues and everything really is er
1	yeah unclear
1	so you re not you weren t a chain smoker but sometimes not far off
1	that s true
1	it was it was just one after another wasn t it
1	it s true
1	i mean look when i brought that carton back for you
1	oh that s fatal but i d be the same with a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine or
1	i started so i ll finish vocal desc laugh i i i feel i feel the same often with a bottle of wine
1	it s called dipsomania pause dur long
1	here s to intemperance oh no my glass is nearly empty
1	oh pause dur short
1	well i like to er pause dur short do you want some more
1	yeah go on twist my arm pause dur short ah
1	i like to pause dur short you know pause dur short a stress free day not have to get up early you know the alarm i used to hate that so wake up when your body tells you you ve had enough sleep
1	who this is your perfect morning
1	well it s my ideal type of day
1	right
1	and i get up when i don t need any more sleep
1	yes
1	and then do something useful er if i can for most of the day i mean like today i was meeting somebody job interview coming back doing my cv you know
1	yes
1	and i ve only just stopped now right so now i feel like well it s the end of the day i deserve a drink pause dur short yeah so pause dur short it s er but i feel that to have a a reasonably a reasonable day i need to have a combination of work effort anyway and erm some kind of reward at the end of it to relax do you feel the same do you feel you need to do something usually
1	mm erm no i think it s a dangerous thing really to think like that i think i believe that pause dur short to pause dur short because then you re dependent it creates a dependency
1	well it doesn t have to i mean it s that s it s not it s only lately that er
1	i m saying no you asked me a question
1	yeah
1	unclear you thought about it
1	yeah okay
1	but it was your you d earnt it or that you know or what trunc phra trunc what was the phrase you used not that you d earnt it you deserved it or
1	yeah something like that
1	so erm pause dur short i have to look at stuff like that because i basically am an alcoholic
1	really
1	and i have to and because i have er trouble with my liver and i ve been warned that if i drink it would kill me if i went back to drinking because i m quite on the edge of drinking and i still drink a bit but pause dur short erm and that drinking has caused my diabetes the fatty liver has caused my diabetes as well erm pause dur short and i m well aware of sort of the internal voice that makes excuses for myself and allows me to do things that aren t good for me
1	mm
1	i d much rather say oh well trunc f trunc fuck it you know i i know this is going to kill me i know it s not good for me but i m gonna have it anyway vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	and rather than to
1	unclear
1	kick myself and say well i ve earned this i justify this i don t you know i have to say this makes me this is this takes away some of my pain vocal desc laugh or the pain of life and er but and you know it s bullshit pause dur short continually we fool ourselves there s something in us that keeps us fooling ourselves and i m well aware that pause dur short that there s plenty within me that needs to be addressed as it were and needs needs to be worked on and yeah and that s fine i do it in my own way i think i do it in the quiet of my room thinking
1	you ll go blind
1	well i m just going to do it until i need glasses
1	vocal desc laugh is that why you ve got so many pairs
1	absolutely
1	i ve never known anybody with so many glasses as you ve got vocal desc laugh they re everywhere of all shapes and sizes
1	i know
1	and colours
1	i know well my glasses
1	how trunc ma trunc have you ever counted them up
1	no well basically i use two strengths of glasses i use one point oh i use i think one point fives for work and if i need to look at something really close up in detail i need two point fives and then i have different eye glasses and hand glasses to to erm magnifying glasses to see what i m doing at different levels if i need to really look at something really intricately erm so all my glasses are in doubles i ve got a white pair of one point fives and a white pair of two point fives and because i buy them at the pound shop
1	ah
1	they only cost me a pound a pair and
1	really
1	i so i use them also as fashion fashionable
1	fashion statements
1	i like them fashion statements so i ve got white ones i ve got erm all different types of ones in both sizes then i ve got the ones like like i m holding in my hands these big al like ones that someone had that worked for me but er they had them at a dinner party and said er i like your glasses i ll swap you mine for yours and okay and and i ve also got another pair of glasses that i bought for a pound or two pounds and they re specsaver glasses and probably cost a hundred quid from the market for two quid that er are in my strength but what happens is with my type of work that i do i scratch damage break or lose quite a considerable amount of glasses
1	mm
1	and so the amount of glasses i m probably looking at monetarily in terms probably if i said fifteen pounds it would probably be too much and probably probably you re looking at about ten pounds so it s ten pounds twelve quid
1	i wouldn t have thought you d have got through all that many pair pairs of glasses being a male escort
1	well it depends on what you re doing
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it depends what you re doing you know i i don t have eyes in the back of my head but it unclear
1	so then you d wear two pairs of glasses vocal desc laugh
1	if that s what you re thinking yeah so that that s it really pause dur long
1	i m gonna go to anon type place tomorrow to see about
1	have you
1	erm
1	vocal desc laugh to see about this er charity thing
1	yes
1	charity shop business pause dur short
1	well good luck just remember to get the save the good stuff for me
1	i ll give you
1	and when i come in give it to me cheap
1	yeah i ll give you a call
1	alright i m gonna find out when you re on the till and i ll come in there and you give me a you say oh that s a quid that s that much alright okay
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well done
1	charity begins at home
1	mm that s why they should be called charity shops pause dur short not for the two hundred and fifty thousand a year they pay their the guy who runs it yeah it ll be interesting to find out how much they do pay the bloke who runs it won t it
1	well the
1	interesting
1	the little i ve found out about this so far is that there s normally a manager or manageress gets paid
1	oh yeah
1	and the rest are volunteers
1	right well the managers are paid quite well i believe
1	are they
1	so i believe
1	it s funny that cos i i went to the other one erm anon type place
1	oh yeah
1	and i haven t heard anything from them
1	yeah well that s strange isn t it
1	yeah
1	what did you leave did you leave a er
1	well i just left a form but it wasn t so detailed as
1	no
1	oh you re operating on your hand
1	yeah i m cutting open my hand with a penknife to get a rather large wooden splinter out that has gone septic in my hand but they say that s the best thing you can do with wood to let it go septic and the pus forms around the wood and when you squeeze it just pops out which has just happened here it just has popped out oh my god that s a long one look i don t know how good your
1	oh my eyes are useless
1	really
1	yeah
1	god that s just come out of my hand here you are put that on and have a look
1	pause dur long it s just blur
1	sorry
1	it s just blur
1	really
1	yeah
1	oh pause dur short you can t see that
1	oh yeah with if i don t wear glasses up close it s fine it is big isn t it
1	mm that was in my finger
1	almost a thorn rather than a splinter
1	really yeah yeah no but it was yeah it looks like a thorn but it is a it is a splinter oh it was sort of paining me that was
1	paining unclear
1	so what are you going to do with your life
1	well i could define that anon nametype m type name try and get a job and somehow look after anon nametype f type name you know what they say trust to the universe to sort everything out well that s what i m doing at the moment i m i m trying to be positive and and not let the situation get me down and i think i m getting better anon nametype f type name said today she said oh you sound very good today she said compared to you know what i was before
1	right
1	mm i think i m i m moving in an upward direction of course it oscillates from day to day but generally it s it s getting better and er
1	yeah
1	i finished my my last antidepressant last night and
1	oh right
1	i m due to go to the doctor on thursday so
1	yeah
1	it ll be interesting to see if two days without them has any effect
1	do you think they have helped you
1	i don t know because unless i go without them there won t be any way to compare if it s natural or not
1	don t you remember what you were like before you started taking them
1	i certainly do but is that due to the pills or your help and anon nametype f type name s help or a combination of both and my or myself and and me helping myself and trunc i trunc it s i don t know
1	i don t know right but they know there you go then
1	er but i ll i ll certainly get some more
1	will you
1	oh yeah yeah
1	what even if you feel okay
1	well if i don t get any more i i mean i can do an experiment right er and go without them and see if there s any difference if there s no difference then i can do without them but
1	right
1	if i slip back into it again
1	yeah
1	i ll i ll need them on hand as it were
1	i m with you

1	yeah
1	which is great and er but there s trunc s trunc some other musician who apparently performed the work in two thousand and eleven erm explained it that erm it s it is repetitive but it takes us in different ways and different places but in the end like any good work of art erm music brings us back and therefore encapsulates the whole thing in a
1	it s like a trip
1	in a way yes it s a musical trip
1	yeah
1	yes erm so and that s why he reckons it s a perennial classic apparently it s up to sixteen million copies have been sold so far i trunc th trunc

1	the album apparently you know they got this manor
1	right
1	and this is where they recorded all the artists and erm as fate would have it it just threw some person and meeting another person and he he found himself there and he had managed to
1	do you need to blow your nose
1	yes i do thank you erm he managed to put down on a two track tape recorder
1	who was this
1	mike oldfield
1	right
1	the erm the basic concept of the album and he recorded it on two tracks and played it
1	on two tracks
1	yeah
1	wow amazing
1	and played it to er i think one of the ultimate producers of the album
1	who produced it
1	er two guys and they i don t know their names
1	oh i thought he produced it
1	no he
1	oh really
1	he er
1	how amazing
1	well anyway they found themselves in the recording in the manor
1	yeah
1	where they recorded the album pause dur short and they said they thought it was a great idea i mean revolutionary i mean
1	yeah
1	the idea that pause dur short one album both sides can comprise of of one single track never been done before and they said go for it and richard branson was saying that er he thought it was a great idea but at that time the cash flow wasn t great and they were just struggling to survive and he said
1	who virgin records were
1	yeah yeah and that er they but they thought it was such a trunc gr trunc an innovative concept and great potential although musically speaking i mean branson s favourite song apparently was er i m a batchelor boy by cliff richards you know so that
1	jesus christ
1	that that was yeah i know so he had no idea er about the the quality of the music but he realised and was told of its potential and he said well yeah go ahead and they said well what do you need and then mike oldfield wrote down a whole long list of all these different instruments that he needed including the glockenspiel and all the rest of it
1	oh yes
1	and he played every instrument on the album himself
1	does he
1	yeah
1	god almighty
1	and he was saying er what was the name of the the artist i can t remember
1	mike oldfield
1	no the the artist that some guy had been recording i can t remember who it was now some guy had been recording there before him and they re clearing out the studio and pause dur short as he s waiting for the the the studio to be emptied there were these tubular bells and

1	unclear
1	and and and they got vivienne
1	what was the name of the album
1	well it hadn t been formulated then
1	oh right
1	then it came from that and it came from it because er they introduced er into er an artist who was gonna do produce the cover and you remember that the cover of the tubular bells is like that
1	yes
1	and everybody was blown away er by the art of of it pause dur short and er and that s how it came about to be called tubular bells
1	yes pause dur short it s fantastic
1	i mean trunc wh trunc when he d he d written it at least side one erm pause dur short it hadn t been titled you know it s er so erm and then they they put down the first side and he had to he had to write a side two which is i think you know much weaker but er still incredibly interesting pause dur long

1	well there s a cheering thought hurrah
1	let s let s drink to that
1	yes
1	here s to death

1	it reminds me of a time anon nametype f type name and i were in er in anon type place at my first teaching post and we had a room and we shared a house with other teachers and we had a room and er i was lying on the bed there and i had my knees crossed and up like that and a book trunc prop trunc propped against it and i was reading er i think it must have been er deepak chopra s book and i was reading this and my knees started to go like this why am i doing this and i looked up and i saw this light bulb bulbs i think it was an actual chandelier thing and it would be going like this and i d think it s not me and it was a bloody earthquake
1	can we switch that off now
1	yeah if you want
1	yeah
1	it was an earthquake pause dur short there we go eighty two minutes night night oh how do i stop it there we go
1	i ve been a model trunc engin trunc nothing to do with cataracts i ve been a model engineer for nearly thirty years pause dur short erm pause dur short i ve built three traction engines i m now doing a railway engine pause dur short built a number of stationary engines pause dur short workshops been built up over the years pause dur short several lathes pause dur short different types different milling machines pause dur short been a member of the club for pause dur short anon type place model engineers for nearly thirty years pause dur short and i m here on a working party doing not a lot
1	vocal desc laugh so the background noises we can hear are other people working this morning pause dur short erm pause dur short can you tell me pause dur short er all the things you ve done anon nametype m type name over the years pause dur short what would you say pause dur short erm was your biggest achievement
1	probably the last traction engine pause dur short mclaren compound
1	right pause dur short and erm was that pause dur short can you tell me the erm pause dur short where that originates from the mclaren compound
1	it was pause dur short ordered by the war office pause dur short for service in the first world war pause dur short but it never saw service but it wasn t completed until nineteen nineteen pause dur short so it was surplus to requirements by that time
1	right
1	it went pause dur short for road haulage pause dur short but the road hauliers didn t like it they said it was too big pause dur short converted to a showman s engine the showman didn t like it pause dur short because they said it was too big pause dur short and subsequently the wheels were cut back to make it better for pause dur short british roads pause dur short the steering was moved from one side to the other for the same reason pause dur short and it went back into service as a road locomotive heavy haulage
1	oh right pause dur short they are very dramatic i frequently see you at shows driving erm your steam engines pause dur short erm what are you working on at the moment
1	erm my first railway engine pause dur short which is a
1	oh right
1	a narrow gauge engine pause dur short at er pause dur short seven and a quarter inch gauge pause dur short but because it s a narrow gauge it works out at er pause dur short almost third full size
1	oh right pause dur short i see and how far pause dur short down pause dur short down the line are you working on that
1	i ve pause dur short i ve a pause dur short i have a rolling chassis i ve been on it pause dur short a year pause dur short next month
1	oh pause dur short gosh pause dur short so how much time do you put in every day
1	about three hours a day
1	really
1	yeah
1	that s real dedication
1	mm
1	one of the things that s always appealed to me about the model engineers is the pause dur short people who do it are real engineers pause dur short they re not train spotters pause dur short they re not unclear
1	oh no i m not trunc n trunc not really
1	they re pause dur short they re not train set people
1	no pause dur short i m
1	trunc the trunc
1	not really into railways railways have always left me cold erm from the age of nine
1	oh right
1	to twenty one pause dur short we lived pause dur short in a cottage with a very long garden pause dur short at the bottom of which was the mainline railway track
1	oh right
1	and i wasn t a bit interested in the trains
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short vocal desc laugh oh right
1	back in the er the days of steam you d be
1	yes
1	er specially in the summer if you had the door open
1	yes
1	and you hear a train coming and look out you could see the glow from the firebox as it went past
1	yes pause dur short yeah yes
1	but erm pause dur short my biggest erm thought of railways at that time was that they trunc inter trunc interrupted whatever i was listening to whether it was the television or what
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	you couldn t hear a thing as they trundled past
1	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh well your trunc trai trunc your erm trunc d trunc engines here are a lot less noisy than that aren t they
1	well of course they re a lot smaller pause dur short yes
1	yeah pause dur short and this has been a wonderful project on this pause dur short field here pause dur short er
1	it has it s had its ups and downs
1	yeah
1	it s not perfect but then whatever is
1	yeah pause dur short i remember when they first said because i used to live in anon type place erm er before i met anon nametype m type name twenty years ago
1	yeah
1	and erm pause dur short when i lived here it was trunc a trunc around the time that somebody bulldozed the pavilion do you remember that
1	er no pause dur short i don t actually remember it but i the story has been told to me on numerous occasions yeah
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short numerous occasions pause dur short and i remember
1	they they stole a digger and demolished the pavilion yeah pause dur short yeah
1	yes that s right vocal desc laugh that s absolutely right
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	well i i remember reading it in the gazette and i said when you said you pause dur short when they all said they were coming here from anon type place i thought my goodness pause dur short oh dear pause dur short i don t hold up much hope so i was quite pessimistic about it
1	unclear yeah unclear
1	erm pause dur short because there has been a pause dur short i mean there was one lady i don t know whether you know this in anon type place pause dur short who gave a talk at anon type place hall pause dur short vocal desc misc she came from london to talk to a group pause dur short and the group pause dur short outside there was erm pause dur short a group of boys and they banged on the windows and pounded on the doors and pause dur short she was so terrified she said she would rather give a talk in london than she would in anon type place
1	really
1	and that yeah pause dur short that there was such pause dur short you know the erm anon type place hall where
1	yeah
1	where they ve got a similar sort of layout haven t they with children s pause dur short swings and
1	no when i was a teenager
1	mm
1	there were a pause dur short i won t call em a motorcycle gang but pause dur short there were a number of lads pause dur short with motorcycles that came from anon type place
1	right pause dur short right
1	and er pause dur short i got quite friendly with them and pause dur short they weren t pause dur short that bad
1	no no
1	least i didn t think so at the time
1	these pause dur short no pause dur short these were youngsters
1	i probably would now
1	these were you know pause dur short school age children
1	oh right yeah yeah
1	they were trunc ch trunc school age children pause dur short i was quite pause dur short the reason i pause dur short was said that to you was i was booked for the next speaker pause dur short to speak there pause dur short and i did a talk on erm pause dur short er pause dur short women s periodicals in the victorian trunc eng trunc
1	right
1	in victorian england which i had found a collection of in a junk shop
1	right
1	and i talked about it and i ve got still got them and they re wonderful pause dur short and erm they said to me oh we hope it s not like last vocal desc laugh time and then they told me about it so that s how i knew
1	yeah pause dur short right
1	of it really pause dur short erm pause dur short anyway erm pause dur short so pause dur short er pause dur short the pause dur short the erm pause dur short project here has gone from strength to strength recently
1	yes pause dur short er pause dur short well we ve got about half a mile of track pause dur short we ve got points we ve got sidings pause dur short the first lot pause dur short was fabricated off site pause dur short at the engineering workshop of er pause dur short of one of our members pause dur short who is pause dur short kind enough to let us use his equipment
1	right
1	including his welder and his machines for for pause dur short making points pause dur short the rest was was built on the ground here on site
1	right then you ve got a turntable pause dur short er
1	we have a turntable
1	yeah
1	yeah pause dur short we ve
1	er
1	we ve got a return loop unfortunately we haven t pause dur short a continuous run from the station pause dur short so the trains go out go round a loop pause dur short back through the woods pause dur short and then back pause dur short onto the turntable where they re turned pause dur short and run around a train pause dur short we have got a continuous loop down the bottom but that doesn t help passengers pause dur short on and off the station
1	right pause dur short right
1	so i ve just seen somebody else turn up possibly with an engine
1	oh right
1	they did say they wanted to get the bugs out of this engine
1	oh did they pause dur short oh right
1	yeah
1	so let s have let s see how far we ve we how well we ve got on at the moment pause dur short erm pause dur short well we re on six nearly seven minutes so we ve got another ten to take
1	right pause dur short there might there might be a trace of anon type place in my voice because my parents came from anon type place
1	oh right pause dur short oh did they pause dur short so what what age were you when you left anon type place or pause dur short you
1	i wasn t i was born here
1	you were born here
1	mm
1	yeah where were you born then
1	anon type place street
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes vocal desc laugh oh right
1	there was no childbirth on the national health in nineteen forty seven so i m given to understand they had to pay for it
1	oh pause dur short right pause dur short oh right
1	mm
1	oh well that s erm pause dur short that s er so you ve been in actually been in this area all your life pause dur short and erm pause dur short we ve erm pause dur short er we ve moved around a lot but you haven t moved anywhere
1	well not out of the area no and we ve moved
1	no
1	houses in the locality
1	yes
1	yes
1	so your biggest influence as far as speech is concerned will would ve been
1	anon type place pause dur short yeah
1	yeah anon type place
1	i remember when we first moved to anon type place
1	right
1	which by then i mean it s part of the town virtually now
1	yes
1	but when we went there i was nine that would ve been nineteen fifty pause dur short trunc f trunc six
1	right

1	right
1	and er pause dur short my mother had pause dur short they didn t get married till after the war pause dur short and i came along quite quickly afterwards pause dur short so she wasn t conversant with the anon type place accent
1	right
1	and pause dur short the neighbours were very very broad pause dur short anon type place
1	right
1	and one of them pause dur short vocal desc cough pause dur short said to her one day pause dur short i went down the garden i leant again big tree pause dur short and it was covered in unclear the ants now unclear
1	vocal desc laugh

1	er pause dur short the yetis pause dur short er recorded a version of it pause dur short erm pause dur short i know where there s a blackbird s nest but it s more anon type place than anon type place that s a very subtle difference but not a lot
1	oh there is pause dur short so where did you go to college then and pause dur short what did you do so you you grew up in anon type place
1	i pause dur short i left school started an apprenticeship

1	yeah
1	actually what went onto a rotary letterpress machine
1	oh really
1	but that s all long gone now of course
1	because i used to dampen them and i
1	yeah
1	used to paint on the back you could paint on the back i used pause dur short every so often i would get one of these and i d do a picture on the back of it
1	yes
1	er pause dur short so erm how long were you doing that for printing
1	er eleven years in the trade
1	yeah
1	then i went into the civil service
1	yeah
1	and er i did a variety of jobs then all print related
1	right
1	production control pause dur short erm planning
1	right pause dur short right
1	and finally er graphics
1	right
1	and hence the apple mac
1	oh yes yes well you do some very good leaflets for the model engineers i ve seen them and they do take a lot of time
1	know what my wife said when i showed her the first one
1	what vocal desc laugh did she say vocal desc laugh
1	she said cor that looks good that s almost professional
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i said what the hell do you think i ve been doing for the last forty nine years vocal desc laugh

1	i don t watch it pause dur short mm
1	erm pause dur short but they don t really interest me either

1	right
1	and erm pause dur short my brother anon nametype m type name went on for an hour pause dur short and we sat in the car in anon type place pause dur short erm on the anon type place looking out by the pub cos we were going to have lunch

1	and we sat there and by the end we trunc fin trunc the all the windows were steamed up and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short and i trunc loo trunc i said good heavens anon nametype m type name they ll be wondering what we ve been doing erm trunc i trunc halfway through he had to jump out he got so hot and take his coat off but anyway that s enough of me

1	no
1	erm pause dur short have you been on any good trips with the trunc mo trunc model engineers recently then
1	yes pause dur short erm pause dur short we went to pause dur short coal mine in anon type place in wales
1	oh yes pause dur short mm mm
1	went to anon type place steam railway had a footplate ride pause dur short i ve been to anon type place pumping station pause dur short and of course every year i go to anon type place
1	right
1	courtesy of one of our members and we stay pause dur short with his son pause dur short trunc t trunc make a weekend of it
1	we love anon type place we absolutely love anon type place
1	i ve never been into the town
1	haven t you
1	no
1	oh it s it s lovely
1	no
1	it s so such a pause dur short well kept pause dur short all the flowerbeds
1	right
1	are beautiful the park s beautiful
1	er pause dur short well the exhibition s not there pause dur short this next year
1	oh isn t it
1	no it s at erm pause dur short anon type place racecourse
1	oh is it right pause dur short oh well i like anon type place trunc ra trunc vocal desc laugh racecourse as well vocal desc laugh
1	never been there so so
1	yeah well pause dur short we were lucky anon nametype m type name had er one of those
1	mm
1	corporation things with trunc c trunc companies and we were asked to go to a race meeting there it was a long way to go but enjoyable
1	mm
1	you didn t go to the one on er laser cutting out at
1	no pause dur short no it was too early for me
1	not your thing
1	no pause dur short well it is but er pause dur short it was such an effort trunc co trunc we have our meal the time i d have to be
1	yeah
1	you know so pause dur short i i dodged out of that one
1	yeah pause dur short i went to that one i found it interesting because years ago
1	yeah
1	for about a a brief spell of time i worked i was one of the first steel saleswomen from anon type place metals
1	really
1	at anon type place steel stockholders yeah pause dur short and my pause dur short my pause dur short i was anon type place and anon type place pause dur short that was my unclear patch unclear
1	so you will know the difference between en one a and en three d then
1	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur short well
1	and en eight
1	yeah well pause dur short what would happen was people would ring up and ask us for it
1	yeah
1	and then i would do a er trunc ch trunc stop check pause dur short on the computer
1	yeah
1	but i worked for a chap called anon nametype m type name who was pause dur short absolutely amazing
1	quite an appropriately named guy really for steel vocal desc laugh
1	yeah yeah vocal desc laugh he pause dur short and her erm pause dur short he used to get these substandard gasometers and get them melted down and
1	yeah
1	he used to get all sorts of iffy steel from all over the place
1	oh yeah
1	but it was good fun
1	yeah
1	and i loved working for them and then pause dur short my old company head hunted me back so that was quite exciting pause dur short i i i never thought i d be head hunted but i was and they gave me a car and everything vocal desc laugh so
1	don t grumble at that
1	it was yeah i can t no but i trunc d trunc
1	no
1	i actually wish i hadn t pause dur short moved but there again pause dur short you know you everything s always
1	well you get time
1	in retrospect
1	time goes on doesn t it life goes on
1	yeah it does pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short so erm pause dur short i think we re just about finished i ll just check for you pause dur short yeah pause dur short we ve just finished so we re sixteen minutes fifty eight
1	okay that s alright then
1	yeah it is okay
1	it s a trunc co trunc becomes a bit of a competition then
1	mm
1	so where s their where s maddox and that lot where s their report pause dur short where s their environmental unclear
1	well they they ve said they it s not necessary
1	mm
1	ideally you want anon type place to say well you do your bloody assessment
1	exactly
1	it puts cost on them
1	mm
1	that s was the because they re what we had opted for the turbines think of as many ways as you can and ducking and diving pause dur short and kicking the can down the road
1	yeah
1	and think of as many things as you can to put cost on unclear del boy unclear
1	mm
1	and that s when we brought the heritage expert out of the top hat
1	absolutely pause dur short yeah
1	vocal desc laugh but oh i don t i m getting a bit old for all these fights vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	yeah you re getting very pause dur short cantankerous in your old age
1	vocal desc laugh what you on about pause dur long
1	what have i got to do pause dur short so you don t like me doing this
1	well pause dur short what s it what s this reading telegraph and all then
1	oh got it on
1	oh god well i were er we should have seen pressing buttons won t we
1	right it s not really it s not really
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so where were we
1	yeah well we we were kicking the can down the road
1	yeah
1	as quickly as we could
1	mm pause dur long
1	but i would think the pause dur short the outcome would be the members say well it s all too much er to take in defer the decision pause dur short kick it down the road for a month and then refuse it
1	mm
1	seek more information
1	but that would be the ideal thing pause dur short absolutely and it happened so many times in our case didn t it er referrals and
1	yeah
1	so yeah
1	the worst the worst outcome is if they approve it but i can t see that
1	right
1	so they either reject it or defer it
1	are we all going are we the three of us going we are
1	i would think so
1	mm
1	half past six
1	mm pause dur short er pause dur short you sure it s half past six yeah i think it is just
1	ours was at unclear
1	i think there s a possibility that it s six o clock
1	oh trunc ri trunc oh yeah pause dur short ah
1	just but i trunc c trunc i six o clock seems to
1	mm
1	stick in my mind more than six thirty
1	but the other thing that s concerning me is er anon nametype f type name seems to be away
1	mm
1	in fact i went round her house pause dur short cos she didn t pause dur short respond to the emails she didn t respond to the phone calls and i thought oh
1	so how much notice would she need if she agreed to trunc t trunc i mean we don t even know if they they re doing anything er
1	anon type place s put a trunc r trunc erm an objection in
1	oh they have
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	but what we don t know is whether anybody at anon type place is er pause dur short gonna speak but they ve only got three minutes
1	mm
1	and that s where anon nametype f type name s unclear in pound seats unclear really cos
1	yeah
1	she was
1	but if er anon type place have got three minutes how come anon type place have got three minutes
1	anon type place haven t got three minute
1	so they haven t got anybody pause dur short to talk
1	the parish trunc counc trunc
1	but they they might
1	anon type place parish council aren t allowed to speak the opposition group
1	oh right okay
1	has got three minutes objectors
1	okay got you
1	right
1	got you pause dur short yeah okay
1	and if there s a lot of objectors
1	yeah
1	the three minutes is split
1	right
1	so they ve really gotta get their act together and just get one speaking
1	well i think they want one don t they this erm
1	yeah
1	this anon nametype m type name person he s gonna be the spokesperson i think
1	yeah unless you get the professional that anon nametype f type name
1	yeah well that s what you suggested pause dur short yeah
1	cos i don t believe the planning committee will pause dur short put much weight on the emotion they ll
1	mm mm
1	have to stick on the facts because if they don t these developers are quite clever
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	and they ll appeal it and judicial review it and oh god
1	but that again trunc k trunc kicks the can down the road doesn t it and er
1	yeah that s right that s what it s all about
1	yeah
1	in my opinion pause dur short kick it down the road as far as you can
1	trunc w trunc will anon nametype f type name be there
1	who yes
1	she she will mm
1	yeah there s there s gotta be the the case officer there
1	mm
1	and my little friend
1	vocal desc laugh anon nametype m type name
1	erm yeah and the legal guy
1	mm
1	or woman
1	oh right
1	er remember that

1	that was er
1	yeah
1	at ours on the unclear palisades unclear
1	yes i yes yeah
1	that i got hold of the following day and
1	yeah
1	said you re completely out of order went full scale said there wasn t a unclear bund unclear in the planning application
1	mm
1	and there was
1	mm pause dur long
1	anon nametype f type name somebody
1	yeah pause dur short trunc jus trunc do they all still think it s at the town hall that s another thing i mean
1	well i don t know i i said to i emailed anon nametype m type name but i didn t pause dur short embarrass him by pressing the reply all all button
1	no
1	i just said to him look
1	but he hasn t nothing s come out has it that
1	no

1	no
1	so some of them will be going to the
1	well
1	to the town hall
1	that i don t know
1	mm mm pause dur short so we don t know then
1	well it
1	well we re not going to the town hall
1	it s gonna be a bit embarrassing if they all turn up at the town hall innit
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	with their banners
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	oh i dunno
1	i think it might be six but i m not sure about that but er
1	i ll check it when i get home
1	yeah pause dur short which might indicate though if it is six that they re in for a long pause dur short meeting
1	it s number two on the list
1	oh right okay
1	i ve checked that pause dur short there are no er meeting papers yet
1	oh
1	but er but there is an agenda and that one s item number two
1	oh pause dur short okay pause dur long so it s could be that we ll pause dur short meet about i dunno five if it s six to go over there
1	yeah
1	and then we ve got to work out the car parking system
1	yeah
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they give you a secret number don t they er it changes every day
1	yeah so they they put the number up at the start of the meeting

1	just watches rugby is his lot
1	oh pause dur short yeah okay
1	but he s quite pause dur short he s quite positive about it
1	yeah
1	about it all probably more positive than anon nametype f type name is actually
1	he always looks very dapper
1	yeah
1	i thought he looked very dapper at the erm pause dur short at the musical we went to
1	mm
1	he trunc lo trunc you know cos he had a dicky bow on and everything
1	yeah
1	he looked just just the part i thought he looked like the manager
1	vocal desc laugh
1	like a theatre manager pause dur short did you think
1	yeah but he s er pause dur short he s alright he s
1	mm
1	like i say trunc h trunc he pause dur short he don t look as bad as he did
1	no
1	twelve months ago but then you wouldn t expect him to
1	no
1	i don t suppose pause dur short i noticed there s one of the houses up for sale in
1	i noticed that as well
1	it s not anon nametype m type name s though
1	oh it s er
1	i think it
1	what s his name anon nametype m type name
1	anon nametype m type name is it
1	yeah pause dur short oh right
1	erm er that s up for sale
1	yeah i never see him i wouldn t
1	no i don t
1	i wouldn t trunc kn trunc i wouldn t know his car or anything
1	no i erm pause dur short well er all i know him from pause dur short the save anon type place cos he trunc w trunc he turned up at
1	yeah
1	a few of the er hearings
1	yeah pause dur short mind you i think he was studying the form in relation to his cases rather than
1	oh yeah
1	yeah
1	i m sure he was
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so maybe he s going erm i dunno maybe he s going back to south africa cos he s south african unclear pause dur short maybe he s going back there i don t know
1	i i thought he d he s also got a house in erm anon type place or he did have i think
1	really
1	he built these two
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short cos of course the planning permission was initially for one and then he came along once they d got the planning permission for one they came along for two on the basis of my my mother s getting very old and we want her to move in with us er you know we wanna keep an eye on her so can we have two
1	so they just that was just lies
1	yeah and then it wasn t the sort of granny flat that i think people envisaged
1	mm
1	because then old anon nametype m type name s house gets built which is
1	mm
1	like a four bedroomed half a million quid kick
1	and how much too high was it because er
1	it was
1	our our neighbour trunc d trunc objected
1	that s right
1	mm
1	well it was too high
1	it was too high yeah
1	yeah that s right but as is the want of our district council they got away with it
1	mm
1	in the same way as the got away with er new england lodge up there pause dur short that is way
1	mm
1	beyond the planning application in terms of square footage floor area and in terms of height
1	but we ve come to trunc ex trunc except expect this haven t we it s like pushing the envelope
1	that s right oh yeah
1	to its erm
1	that s right
1	i dunno to its blooming big envelope
1	vocal desc laugh that s it pause dur short oh yeah
1	so what s the latest for that with the erm pause dur short new england lodge
1	it s still up for sale
1	mm
1	and still the argument going on on access and all this sort of thing
1	and the the he s dropped quite a bit on the price
1	mm he s
1	cos i remember it falling
1	down six fifty now
1	six fifty as opposed to
1	but it s it s stuffed er anon nametype m type name s move pause dur short sorting out the access
1	really
1	yeah
1	well that s been on on the market for ages now hasn t it
1	yeah well i saw anon nametype m type name pause dur short four months ago when it was sold and said when are you when are you moving and he said oh we ll be moving within two to three months
1	right
1	and i so when you were away i saw him on anon type place and said you know what s the crack now you know you
1	mm
1	when are you going and he said well i don t know pause dur short he said they re still trying to sort out the access issues with new england lodge pause dur short the legal people
1	so does it trunc d trunc is there a road that goes to the back of
1	yeah around the lodge
1	or up the it s in dispute as to who can
1	yeah
1	use it mm
1	that s right
1	and how much you can use it
1	the easements that s right easements and all this sort of thing
1	oh right
1	so it s not just anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name that s in dispute with new england lodge it
1	mm
1	it s anon nametype m type name as well
1	i didn t realise it was event desc unintelligible
1	yeah and er pause dur short the buyer s solicitor won t sign the thing off
1	mm
1	to allow anon nametype m type name to move until it all this lot s sorted out
1	mm
1	and it ain t sorted out pause dur long
1	so it s
1	so
1	so he s got a buyer lined up but it they re not going
1	oh yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah and he s got a place in anon type place
1	mm pause dur short oh has he
1	yeah
1	oh right
1	but er
1	a bit more remote there isn t it
1	mm
1	it s er
1	no he was a bit he was a bit dejected the other morning
1	was he pause dur short mm
1	so
1	did i do you know about anon nametype m type name he s sold his house now in anon type place
1	has he
1	yeah
1	oh right
1	he got quite a good price for it
1	right
1	and er
1	so he s bought four in belfast now
1	well it s a bit like that the plan is for him to buy a house pause dur short er the house that they re living in at the moment erm pause dur short which is i trunc th trunc i think that s anon nametype f type name s father s house but he s gonna buy it off anon nametype f type name s dad and they re then gonna buy anon nametype f type name s mum s house pause dur short so it s like two for the price of what or three
1	oh yeah
1	for the price of one
1	yeah
1	there s erm pause dur short the erm pause dur short the detached house that anon nametype f type name s mum owns is er four bedrooms just double garage plenty of land drive for fifteen cars or something hundred and fifty thousand pause dur short there what would that be around here about six hundred thousand
1	six hundred five hundred or six hundred
1	so and and they re gonna buy that together my understanding and anon nametype m type name s also gonna buy this house pause dur short erm that they re living in now for about sixty or seventy and rent it out so he s beginning to be a bit of a landlord i think it s not a bad plan is it but
1	yeah
1	it s alright as long as he s in belfast
1	yeah and until inland revenue crack down on it pause dur short inland revenue is gonna crack down on buy to lets in a bit
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	but erm
1	yeah but
1	in the meantime
1	but if he s got the house i mean that s quite a lot of equity isn t it really
1	mm
1	so you know what i mean
1	yeah
1	and there s gonna be a big move in a couple of weeks and we ve i think the plan is for anon nametype m type name to hire a van locally here and then anon nametype f type name and i and anon nametype m type name will go out over to belfast with all his stuff and then anon nametype f type name and i will bring the van back pause dur short on the ferry so that should be a lot of fun
1	to where where would you go from holyhead or
1	i think he probably
1	stranraer
1	well he s trunc don trunc he did that before he went to holyhead
1	right
1	cos he bought the car over at one stage
1	yeah
1	erm
1	cos it s either holyhead or stranraer isn t it
1	is that when he came back for the wedding that he came that way yes it was no i think they came by oh cos he wanted to take his car back so they came over by air for the wedding
1	mm
1	and then they took the car from here
1	right
1	and then er they went over on the ferry to trunc d trunc well it s dublin isn t it dun laoghaire isn t it
1	yeah
1	and then it s two hours i think from dublin to
1	yeah
1	belfast
1	yeah that s probably about right
1	anyway so i was discussing it with him last night and i think what we ll trunc d trunc it s not finalised but it s likely that the three of us will go over and then somehow we ll get that van back
1	you d better check the insurance on the van too
1	i know it s gotta er you ve got to look into this because
1	mm
1	especially if there s gonna be potentially three drivers
1	and if you re going through republic of ireland
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	they might er
1	yeah we need to do all this
1	yeah
1	beforehand
1	sure
1	before before yeah it s a foreign country isn t it
1	yeah
1	yeah unless it is a there must be from liverpool can you go to belfast
1	erm well you can in the summer
1	mm
1	er you can go i think pause dur short there always used to be holyhead ardrossan and
1	mm
1	stranraer
1	well stranraer s a long way to go
1	anyway pause dur short yeah ardrossan s even further
1	is it
1	well ardrossan s quite a bit higher up than stranraer
1	oh i dunno where it is though what about liverpool
1	i m not aware of the liverpool belfast ferries
1	i think there is one
1	is there
1	mm pause dur short well literally
1	oh there used to be heysham as
1	the isle of man
1	yeah
1	from liverpool
1	mm
1	maybe pause dur short would that be en route
1	no
1	mm
1	i don t think so and there s heysham up at morecambe that used to do it but that s only a summer thing i think
1	mm pause dur short so that s gonna be a interesting
1	oh right
1	few days away
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short might be cheaper to bung it all in a container
1	well he s been into it it s well i dunno if he s i think once you re into containers that s quite expensive isn t it
1	dunno
1	i i dunno trunc may trunc maybe i should try that it s cos you you d only have a little bit of a container wouldn t you
1	mm
1	so pause dur short but then you ve gotta get it all to where the container is presumably or
1	well they d bring the container to the door pause dur short on the back of a truck and you get three hours to load it up
1	oh right
1	in the price
1	so it s a small container it s not one of these
1	mm
1	bit things with maersk on

1	yes pause dur short yes so
1	so i hadn t pause dur short i hadn t heard of unclear but i ve heard of naomi
1	er only only if pause dur short no if you look it up on the internet
1	mm
1	and pause dur short trunc e trunc you ll find that she was pause dur short trunc o trunc er she played unclear in a bbc television drama about the shooting of john
1	oh right
1	trunc sh trunc what was his name
1	john john
1	john paul john unclear
1	yes yes
1	erm pause dur short which actually is a pretty pretty key role because she was the
1	yes
1	officer in charge and the controller from outside
1	yes
1	er and pause dur short she s done shakespeare work with trevor nunn erm in america
1	mm
1	er pause dur long so pause dur short so erm so she s not a household name
1	no
1	and she s she s something as trunc y trunc you know done done some significant work
1	mm
1	er that pause dur short just pops out from time to time and this was a trevor nunn pause dur short production so i think he turned her her age and er when he was thinking of it
1	mm
1	and that s how she became pause dur short unclear
1	okay so who and who s playing er madame unclear demers unclear
1	er
1	the main actress
1	now trunc y trunc now trunc y trunc now you ve you ve got erm trunc wh trunc i can t remember her name pause dur short i can t remember her name erm pause dur short er and and the wife had a much more prominent role
1	oh did she
1	as as well trunc tha trunc that s the thing she was actually she was really big
1	right
1	er i think that s the thing that s the thing that they were pause dur short they were all roles of equal status
1	mm
1	equal equal size really
1	oh that s the thing
1	er that was the difference between that and the film
1	mm
1	and erm pause dur short erm i just can t remember the names at all pause dur short no can t remember the names at all but it s the same thing the trunc e trunc erm pause dur short erm the wife was played by the the dark head actress the role of prim actress who was in the sex and the city
1	ah yeah
1	er american pause dur short er
1	that s a name i really can t remember
1	i can t remember either pause dur short we can t always remember pause dur short it s jp
1	mm
1	so it s just unclear barbara unclear and pause dur short the ginger one and er of course pause dur short kim cattrall
1	oh yes
1	kim cattrall who pause dur short didn t she do some western roles
1	mm yes
1	and some trunc s trunc trunc s trunc sex and the city
1	mm well she turns out to be unclear
1	yeah she is isn t she
1	yeah from who do you think you are
1	yeah yeah she is she is a unclear erm
1	by some reprobate pause dur short male ancestor who ran off and left all his pause dur short dependence pause dur short and erm pause dur short trunc didn trunc until he went to america unclear turned up but pause dur short it was her father or her grandfather had got all this erm pause dur short i just left this country and left all these women and children
1	mm pause dur long well pause dur short yes well i got one pause dur short not far back pause dur short and we don t know trunc wh trunc what happened pause dur short erm pause dur short yeah my cousin s still looking into it
1	mm
1	and pause dur short oh i thought that was a bit pause dur short trunc th trunc
1	oh no there s only one pause dur short no there s two no there s one pause dur short oh
1	and pause dur short no my cousin s still trunc res trunc still researching it but pause dur short things don t things don t match up with trunc the trunc with those census records and pause dur short trunc th trunc there s a family story that erm pause dur short someone around that time was was married pause dur short was married twice
1	mm
1	er pause dur short probably not bigamously pause dur short but erm
1	oh right
1	so we don t know we don t know what happened that time
1	alright
1	so
1	oh
1	well trunc tha trunc that s not terribly far back
1	well i had a similar thing my great grandmother ran off pause dur short with somebody pause dur short during the first world war left five children pause dur short erm who then had to go and live with their aunt
1	mm
1	and run off with somebody who was ten years her junior
1	mm
1	and er they er then had another family and she had another four children pause dur short so what with the one that died in infancy that was ten children pause dur short that she had anyway she er pause dur short my great grandmother divorced her pause dur short and so she eventually married this other guy pause dur short erm and
1	mm
1	well she trunc s trunc lived with him the whole rest of her life and i think was very happy but erm my father er my grandmother would pretend that trunc sh trunc she died vocal desc laugh and my father was always told that she was dead pause dur short when in fact she wasn t she was only living about er thirty five or forty miles away in erm in nottingham
1	oh wow wow pause dur short mm
1	and only died pause dur short in the nineteen sixties so it would ve been perfectly feasible to
1	mm
1	to er have met or known her actually
1	mm mm
1	but erm pause dur short but anyway she was erm pause dur short her family except they don t want to know our family
1	mm
1	because erm pause dur short there s still somebody living from my grandmother s generation who would probably kill him of shock if he found out
1	right pause dur short right pause dur short mm pause dur long and that s intriguing cos she didn t have any pause dur short the options weren t so weren t so wide as they were now as they are were they
1	well no cos trunc i trunc cos it s of unclear digit transition unclear cos if the pause dur short before erm we didn t know what happened we couldn t know if she had got married to this guy or if they d lived together erm bigamously or pause dur short erm pause dur short or whether erm she had trunc d trunc she never got married to him or what had happened and erm pause dur short and it would ve meant that i would ve needed to work out when they were likely to have been divorced
1	yeah
1	from her first husband pause dur short and then worked out where it took place and i would ve had to then to do sort of do quite a lot of research you know digging about manually as it were and given that she had quite a trunc co trunc not a pause dur short a totally common pause dur short surname but a relatively common surname she only had one first name and one surname so therefore
1	mm
1	even in the year where she was born there s forty or fifty women born in that same year with that exactly the same name
1	yeah
1	and erm we didn t know the name of the man she d run off with so erm so it all sounded a bit impossible until such time as erm one day she just popped up on a pause dur short ancestry dot co dot uk search
1	wow wow gosh yeah
1	mm so and then which was divorce record
1	right
1	so somebody some labour in somewhere some unclear in america i think probably
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	unclear the records and there s you know made a note on it on the pause dur short digital files and up it pops so something has lost forever just suddenly rose the top of the pause dur short file
1	yeah pause dur short wow yes well you re erm pause dur short you re very fortunate like that aren t you cos some
1	mm
1	no one knows anything about my mother s family pause dur short or or that s that s trunc th trunc that s the story
1	mm
1	and i was trying to track down some friends who live pause dur short from their facebook entry looks as if they might ve pause dur short their friends from college they might be living erm just three or four miles away from me
1	mm
1	same place scenarios as anon nametype f type name actually
1	oh right
1	and pause dur short so what did i have to do i had to pause dur short in really trying to track down them i pause dur short i had to pay five pounds to gingery united pause dur short and i only used pause dur short sort of fifty pence
1	mm
1	in trying to track down the the other people
1	oh right vocal desc laugh
1	er and pause dur short so often one that d gone by they reminded me i only got another three days to use my remaining four pounds fifty pause dur short and i trunc t trunc pause dur short probably been talking to my cousin on my mother s side and she pause dur short talked a little bit er and her pause dur short trunc s trunc cos she just one of the reasons i moved here was cos her cousin is only down in fareham
1	alright okay
1	so she s only half an hour s drive away
1	mm
1	and she pause dur short er er had sent me a trunc l trunc copy of the marriage certificates pause dur short of my grandfather pause dur short and we knew about pause dur short my mother s father s side but not my mother s mother s side pause dur short so i just pause dur short put in put in her name and and the records came up pause dur short very quickly with her father s name and i tracked down
1	mm
1	her father s name and pause dur short you know within pause dur short three or four searches then adds pause dur short then adds erm pause dur long yes yes that s it because there was a reasonable amount of information for
1	mm
1	mother s mother
1	mm
1	and erm mother s grandfather pause dur short which actually explains pause dur short explains a lot
1	right
1	because pause dur short not that they always pause dur short pretended that erm she was unclear as she was
1	no
1	it seemed to me
1	right
1	i mean i didn t know but as soon as she trunc s trunc she she trunc ref trunc i mean she was fairly militant as a as a as a woman and as as as as a feminist
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short er and that was great so i was brought up pause dur short taking it for granted that if you work full time as a warden you didn t do housework
1	mm
1	er pause dur short er and and things like that so i i just took it for granted that that erm pause dur short er that reasonably educated women did pause dur short if they wanted they did did have a did have a job
1	yeah
1	as as my mother always has
1	mm
1	erm
1	what did she do
1	she was a teacher
1	aha
1	a teacher she she taught pause dur short erm there would be children they would call her pause dur short erm mother unclear or pause dur short er unclear children or pause dur long i think there s a politically incorrect word for erm er children with learning difficulties or
1	oh
1	or erm pause dur short i can t even think of the politically incorrect words any more
1	unclear
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh vocal desc laugh i trunc c trunc i can t remember
1	thank you
1	thank you erm and er pause dur short her subject well actually is french she she got a degree in french but she said she she claims pause dur short er i keep on saying she claims because pause dur short at the time i was never sure pause dur short that if she was actually saying the truth or saying something unclear but she claimed she couldn t bear to see school children pause dur short wrecking the french language so well it trunc c trunc could ve been better
1	oh dear
1	yeah pause dur short anyway she she d always pause dur short erm claim that she d never been brought up to do pause dur short cooking and housework and pause dur short and er pause dur short my first three years of life pause dur short were were spent in in sudan where there were people to do the cooking and the housework pause dur short erm and when we came back to england pause dur short she then much resented pause dur short having to do that
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short trunc an trunc and part of the resentment she says was she was never brought up to do this
1	right
1	anyway long story short
1	was she very was she brought up in a unclear family then
1	er well
1	but pause dur short they did have to unclear
1	i think it was all pretence because pause dur short erm through the search which i just did a couple of months ago
1	yeah
1	i found her grandfather was a coal miner
1	oh really pause dur short okay vocal desc laugh
1	er and pause dur short erm what is interesting is sort of the setting he was actually a a forest of dean pause dur short coal miner
1	oh yes
1	er since twelve by charge of pause dur short twelve ninety two or something like that
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short anybody anybody born in the hundreds of some rebels gloucestershire which is forest of dean er was entitled to erm take the minerals in forest of dean
1	oh pause dur short wow
1	so he had a whole lot of er individuals erm pause dur short digging digging digging kill
1	what the unclear mines
1	yeah
1	trunc th trunc their trunc m trunc mines
1	mm
1	oh
1	trunc wh trunc
1	he could ve been unclear he could ve made a lot of money
1	he he could ve done
1	i guess so
1	he possibly did and
1	like the american unclear or something
1	mm he could ve done pause dur long and on this marriage certificate oh his daughter s marriage to pause dur short erm my mother s father pause dur short erm he s described as of independent means
1	oh but the unclear he made a fortune out of it
1	erm pause dur short well plausibly he has pause dur short but in the same way as pause dur short trunc i trunc if if if you re if you re doing a a census in unclear pause dur short builder and what his occupation is then i i ve done this on trunc o trunc one on on pause dur short one set of surveys pause dur short then then sometimes so they ll pause dur short come out with company director
1	right yes definitely and then yes it just came in the door
1	erm that s right that s right so pause dur short so we just don t know that s that s an trunc u trunc that s uncertainty
1	mm
1	but it will explain why mother was a bit pause dur short tried to erm pause dur short tried to say she was unclear and she was she must ve been
1	mm
1	feeling a bit trunc int trunc insecure about erm
1	mm
1	er about her er grandfather being a coal miner
1	mm
1	and
1	what year was your mother born
1	say again
1	what year was your mother born
1	nineteen thirteen
1	oh okay
1	and
1	my my granny s born in nineteen three and erm you would trunc s trunc you would ve thought she was extraordinarily posh pause dur short the way that erm that she sort of er presented herself to the world but er
1	yeah
1	she really wasn t
1	wasn t she wasn t she
1	no
1	trunc w trunc trunc w trunc what what were the sort of what were the conflicts what where the differences between er
1	oh it s well there s more than a no i mean i i trunc th trunc erm my my grandfather s family is kind of er one of the shopkeepers of england i suppose
1	yeah
1	and erm pause dur short so erm the trunc fam trunc the family had a restaurant and a deli and a delicatessen pause dur short in stratford
1	mm
1	erm my grandmother s father was a chauffeur in a stately home erm and actually worked in buckinghamshire when i when unclear strand unclear was her family where he was the chauffeur for for many years and then he had his own cargo his own cargo right after trunc th trunc after the war
1	mm
1	where erm erm which trunc i trunc it still exists but he was a sort of garage unclear so trunc i trunc trunc i trunc he was probably the same thing where he was a company director but there was probably only him and trunc a trunc another another bloke or another couple of blokes
1	mm mm
1	and erm so erm pause dur short so i think my trunc m trunc i think it probably trunc s trunc stems from the shame of her mother running off my grandmother s sort of social not trunc preten trunc not pretentions but she really really wanted to be respectful and she wouldn t countenance anything
1	mm mm
1	that would pause dur short you know denigrate her in any way socially in front of other people she was always very sensitive about that and stratford upon avon which is a unclear place
1	mm
1	erm is full of ladies who pause dur short who who have pretentions and there was that stuff which was terrible it was a terrible social war i guess throughout my grandmother s married life as to who was the poshest who had most money who had the nicest house who had the most unclear background who not not pause dur short like today who has the most expensive holidays and stuff like that or who has the biggest cars
1	yeah
1	but really who was who was most refined and most gentile out of everybody
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	and erm
1	yes
1	and and it was really quite sad i think
1	yeah yeah
1	so erm
1	yes
1	you were allowed to have a shop but pause dur short er or a business you know that was okay because they re mostly business people and then the unclear and things like that so you were allowed to you know you trunc d trunc you didn t have to be erm london gentry or having dependent means or something like that it was okay to work for a living but it was really who had pause dur short i suppose whose unclear the least defective this i suppose vocal desc laugh
1	yes yes and the nuances which i trunc s trunc tremendous ones i mean my trunc f trunc mother
1	yes
1	rumbling pause dur short about about relatives er and i don t pause dur short i lost track because she d she talked as if pause dur short you knew who all these names that she turned out were
1	yeah
1	and pause dur short trunc e trunc there was one pause dur short particular pause dur short member on her side who she says was had pause dur short run off with the barmaid who wore pink blouses pause dur short erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	trunc a trunc and and you know trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc there re two nuances
1	yeah
1	erm
1	well at least two three possibly yes run off barmaid pink blouses i er pink blouses were
1	trunc th trunc the barmaid and the pink blouses and trunc i trunc it came across of the pause dur short it was hard to tell whether it was the barmaid or the pink blouses
1	yeah
1	cos my mother s quite a heavy drinker so she pause dur short probably thought barmaids were good things erm erm
1	vocal desc laugh but only if they unclear
1	erm that s that s right anyway went off with this barmaid er who wore pink blouses vocal desc laugh only pause dur short only possibly she just wore a pink blouse on one occasion trunc fo trunc
1	yes
1	and erm it produced children and she said you know like pause dur short i m pretty sure those children don t know they re bastards
1	yes
1	and pause dur short again i didn t really comprehend
1	yes pause dur short well actually my great grandfather
1	why that was important
1	actually also got together with somebody who used to be a barmaid his name is anon nametype m type name
1	uh even better
1	yes
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so my grandmother could barely say the word anon nametype m type name without pause dur short without pause dur short spitting or hissing or or having to wash her mouth out with carbolic unclear and anon nametype f type name was actually a very nice lady and had a couple of children one of whom was called anon nametype m type name so that was i mean not pearls unclear common name to call people as well isn t it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so my my poor grandfather was sort of terribly you know sort of brought down by the world by this feeling so my nan i think probably spent a great deal of time trying to disguise all of this stuff
1	mm
1	and hide it from everybody
1	mm mm whereas now
1	well people go and unclear and then er vocal desc laugh
1	is is he is he
1	or do you do you think allowing that you know you know to have marriages and all sorts of things in their past people went to jail
1	yes yes and nobody pause dur short nobody minds or cares or
1	no
1	or anything but it was pause dur short i mean it was amazing how trunc d trunc pause dur short how strong all these nuances were pause dur short further down the social scale i mean you could
1	yes
1	trunc e trunc okay so erm pause dur short people didn t receive all of these unclear cos she was cos she was divorced even before she
1	mm
1	went off with erm pause dur short erm anon nametype m type name but erm pause dur short she wouldn t be received just cos she was trunc re trunc divorced and er pause dur short yeah yeah
1	so i think that yes it is erm things have changed
1	oh it s much better when other people say pause dur short oh modern life is dreadful and i i i think quite the opposite i think modern life is pause dur short is great pause dur short in trunc th trunc in the sense that pause dur short the erm pause dur short that s what a social condemnation pause dur short and the covering up of things
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short what edward norman called the pause dur short unclear secrets and narrow privacy in family life
1	mm
1	er are not nearly so trunc s trunc pause dur short not nearly so so covered up as they as they once were
1	yeah
1	so much more healthy
1	oh pause dur short event desc sound of machine unclear is going up
1	vocal desc laugh
1	this is supposed to be a quiet environment not as unclear only this thing is quite good at not picking up background noise but
1	mm
1	who knows erm so erm pause dur short so what did your father do i trunc d trunc i didn t catch what your father did he didn t he he loved literature so
1	yes he was
1	but he trunc wa trunc he was a teacher as well then
1	yes he trunc w trunc yes he was he
1	but but that was
1	yeah he was he was a lecturer
1	ah
1	erm a university pause dur short lecturer
1	how many were in sudan as a child was that cos he was teaching then
1	that s right there was in khartoum there was a university college pause dur short erm which did external london degrees
1	mm
1	er i trunc th trunc i think in in in a pause dur short there were quite a lot of colleges like that in pause dur short various bits of erm pause dur short empire pause dur short erm not that sudan s actually pause dur short empire as such it was an anglo egyptian condominium
1	right
1	i read it somewhere pause dur short and erm yeah and that was his job pause dur short straight after straight after the war pause dur short er pause dur short there were some very odd things going on i think in his family pause dur short er pause dur short we only trunc d trunc discovered pause dur short my sister discovered about twenty years ago this was about pause dur short nineteen forty three or nineteen forty four pause dur short my my mother and my parents had been married for a couple of years and had a child of about one pause dur short my mother announced that she wanted to leave my father
1	oh
1	and pause dur short he pause dur short came back from where he was
1	mm
1	and er pause dur short managed to persuade pause dur short managed to persuade her pause dur short not not to go through this
1	mm
1	er pause dur short and i think pause dur short i think that meant that pause dur short immediately after the war she said well pause dur short i don t want to stick around in dreary old britain pause dur short erm when i can t get any food and pause dur short everything s a bit drab and and grey
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short er i think father felt a bit pressured into pause dur short keeping things together by agreeing with her
1	right
1	i don t know trunc tha trunc that s just pure speculation
1	oh right i suppose they must ve gone away for a new start or something you know
1	erm
1	sort of get away from pause dur short perhaps get away from bad influences or like a new start somewhere else or
1	well the thing trunc w trunc pause dur short well i think trunc th trunc trunc y trunc you know once people had been demobilised pause dur short er pause dur short trunc th trunc trunc th trunc the bad influences were pause dur short were less cos i think it was just a general war time pause dur short er atmosphere of of er couples being separated
1	yes
1	and being being fairly young
1	yes
1	and pause dur short she was in bristol where those pause dur short clubs and social life and all that sort of thing
1	yeah
1	and pause dur short and so pause dur short i think it was part of that really and pause dur short the people she was involved with pause dur short don t know could could well ve been american pause dur short for some reason i sort of have a feeling about that
1	ah
1	and
1	it s funny about all those facts isn t it because you know there re sort of bits where trunc y trunc trunc the trunc you have to pause dur short imagine something where it s very difficult to find out trunc th trunc the truth of the matter because it wasn t then recorded or if you could know something it s not necessarily true pause dur short you know so say for example my uncle said to me the other day oh well how did anon nametype f type name pause dur short my great grandmother meet erm pause dur short anon nametype m type name who pause dur short was the guy she went off with and and pause dur short nobody knows how that happened it could even have been her husband that introduced them pause dur short erm or else er
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	you know they lived in a place which where the houses were turned into military for training so
1	yeah
1	so you know perhaps he went there on training while her husband was away we just don t know that s that s another story that my great grandfather chased them through the station of the unclear
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and then he just stopped them leaving and that nobody knows if that s true or not because it s just it is just part of a story and nobody remembers where they heard that
1	mm
1	and whether that was factual or whether that was a supposition or
1	mm
1	whether they imagined that that would trunc ha trunc that that is a sort of thing that he would ve done had
1	yeah of course that s a wonderful erm pause dur short sort of pause dur short elaboration isn t it
1	yeah
1	trunc wh trunc which trunc i trunc is yes pause dur short yes it s it s such a shame cos we didn t know the questions to ask
1	no and also
1	and

1	right
1	which was erm
1	gosh
1	well i don t know i mean i suppose you were that you were legally entitled pause dur short to that money at that time whether it was an act of vindictiveness to go for it or whether your solicitor or your barrister told you you had to cos otherwise you d there was some kind of culpability or or whatever i don t know but there we are

1	yes
1	mm
1	so oops pause dur short so anyway
1	yeah so mother had pause dur short so i i my my guess is that father acquiesced in this
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short gosh acquiesced pause dur short agreed to this
1	yeah
1	is acquiesce terribly pompous erm
1	no it has a specific meaning
1	yes you trunc acqu trunc you acquiesce pause dur short under a bitter duress don t you
1	yes you sort of give in to pressure
1	yeah
1	if you agree er we er we agree to go on holiday together to ibiza but erm if you acquiesce to go to ibiza it suggests that actually you would ve wanted to go somewhere else
1	yeah yeah okay acquiesce
1	and you re going to ibiza to pause dur short to stay er to stay in with your other half
1	yes right okay er no that s that s what i think but i keep on pause dur short getting worried in case i m getting pompous in my er trunc o trunc old age but actually i think yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you re sitting there saying yes but er
1	well vocal desc misc
1	vocal desc misc
1	there are words for things and the english language is a fantastically rich language so you know and it does have more it has more words than french by a long way and so it has got nuances in words
1	well it it it does but trunc th trunc pause dur short er yeah but but pause dur short er trunc l trunc listening to pause dur short younger people sometimes i wonder pause dur short whether trunc th trunc whether they do use language with nuances pause dur short like they like they used to
1	ah well this is one of the aims of this project is to work out the differences between how young people speak and how older trunc s trunc people speak
1	oh is it
1	so one of the sort of things that they said to me in an e mail was you know we re particularly interested if you can get young people to do recordings
1	right
1	so i m gonna go off and talk to my nephews
1	yeah no that s interesting
1	at the weekend
1	that that that really is interesting cos er
1	if i can get them to sit still for an hour that d be a miracle cos they don t do anything for an hour
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they re just they trunc l trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	everything is on the double really with them they can t listen to a whole piece of music
1	yeah
1	erm they ve got to fast forward it pause dur short erm i m afraid they re not very academic so they ve just come back with some very very poor with some poor erm results from their exams but never mind
1	oh pause dur short oh
1	i don t
1	yeah and how did you get involved in this project
1	because a friend of mine pause dur short erm is a pr agent and he has been erm pause dur short and he got sent an e mail and he obviously sent it to everybody in his inbox pause dur short and said erm who trunc w trunc is anybody interested and i thought oh that s really really interesting i mean there was i was going to do erm some oral history with erm pause dur short there was a trunc p trunc there was a job i was going to apply for pause dur short and i didn t apply for it in the end erm but trunc th trunc erm somebody had given a heritage lottery grant to erm the guild of quilters
1	oh yeah
1	to do an trunc ora trunc to do an oral history of quilters and quilting
1	yeah
1	so i erm so i thought oh this is really interesting and i was er just about to apply for the job when i saw that there was an exhibition in anon type place pause dur short at the anon type place and i thought well
1	yes
1	i must go to this exhibition and erm there was a sale there as well erm so erm we anon nametype m type name and i went and there was this crush of women of a certain age
1	vocal desc laugh
1	all in candy coloured rainwear
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and with very sensible shoes and very sensible hair
1	vocal desc laugh
1	who were behaving like a giant flock of starlings they were just landing on everything squabbling elbowing er trunc th trunc just behaving in a really unseemly manner and erm just sort of clawing at each other and clawing at things to make sure that they trunc g trunc they got things before other people got things pause dur short and i just thought i cannot spend three years of my life with these people
1	yeah
1	i am quite interested in quilting but there is no way that i am going to associate
1	vocal desc laugh
1	with erm these people for the next three years because er i mean
1	mm
1	i presume that these are the people that one will then be sent to interview
1	yes
1	so that s erm
1	yes
1	that was all a bit of a disappointment really pause dur short but erm
1	wow
1	but i m very much into oral history anyway cos erm one of the things one of the historians that i very much pause dur short er liked at university and since is studs terkel pause dur short do you know studs terkel
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh trunc g trunc vocal desc laugh stop pause dur short stop drinking
1	vocal desc laugh so what are they what are they gonna produce next
1	i don t know erm
1	studs terkel why have i heard of pause dur short studs terkel he sounds like a porn star really
1	he pause dur short no he was he was on a canadian erm radio presenter but he did oral the history so he did an oral history he did he s done the great depression he s done the second world war he s done books about death he s done trunc th trunc books about poverty all oral history so he sat down and he recorded people talking and then the books are just absolutely unexpurgated and unadorned accounts
1	aha
1	so erm so one of erm when i was i think trunc th trunc was i studying the trunc g trunc i can t remember if i was studying the great depression but erm pause dur short i was i was able to impress my university tutors by being able to give first hand accounts of the of the erm pause dur short of the great depression nineteen thirties in america from you know some people who actually witnessed it
1	oh yes
1	and as i told you earlier my university lecturers were all ex oxford and cambridge and they were all looking at how you learned and taught history in a different way
1	yeah
1	and therefore erm you know that that was a kind of approach that would impress them history from time resources
1	yes yes yes i see pause dur short i see gosh yeah well pause dur short and so where were we yes yes i was in erm
1	completely lost my train now
1	mm
1	oh yes we were talking about quilting and we were talking about oral history and how i got involved in this project that s how we got to here
1	yeah yeah yes yes yes through through through a friend
1	yes
1	yeah yeah that s that s brilliant pause dur short that s pretty good
1	yes i m going to go round and find people who there s there s various i m supposed to be doing a bit of a history about the charity that i m chair of at the moment so i m gonna go round and have conversations with trustees and ex trustees because we re opening our building up for the open house weekend in september
1	mm
1	and i m i m going to be erm i m going to be trunc worki trunc erm sort of trying to produce a little handbook about our project pause dur short and erm to hand out to people who might come round hopefully people will come round
1	yeah
1	we re right opposite the building of the anon type place in brixton so it is entirely possible if they open that they will have ten million visitors and we will have none well we will only have people who were an overspill and can t get in there and just come round our building while they re waiting to queue to get into the other one across the road
1	yes yes trunc wh trunc what church is that
1	oh it s called er anon type place at anon type place so we have a we have a church an old church we look after dating from eighteen twenty four but it s been converted so it s a community centre now rather than a church
1	right
1	it s right in the middle of brixton oh there s dance
1	yes oh the dance yes
1	yes
1	it s a good idea i trunc h trunc i haven t replied
1	yes
1	cos i was away but erm
1	no that s alright
1	but er yeah trunc th trunc trunc th trunc that sounds that sounds good that sounds good that sounds good i ve been trying to think of people to ask to come
1	yes well if we sold i don t know how much people would be prepared to pay
1	mm
1	a tenner fifteen quid
1	yeah trunc ri trunc vocal desc misc trunc e trunc erm pause dur short let me think let me think pause dur short mm ten comes to mind
1	mm and then we ll do unclear drinks for ten quid or just to get in for ten quid
1	trunc s trunc erm pause dur short possibly just get in for ten quid or pause dur short possibly ten quid and trunc th trunc getting the first drink possibly
1	mm oh yeah that s a good idea
1	er yeah and then after that after that carry on carry on playing
1	yeah cos i actually made this massive trunc recor trunc trunc i trunc it s massive well i called it a tape anon nametype m type name keeps saying to me it s not a tape pause dur short erm of erm my all my vocal desc laugh favourite dance music which was seven hours worth by the time i d pause dur short i d to compile a pause dur short a playlist
1	gosh pause dur short gosh and
1	and erm and then so i was and then nobody would get up and dance my unclear could not believe it pause dur short and for the mistake i made pause dur short was i should ve set up music in a separate room with no furniture because the way i set up the house i thought that we d turn the lights out
1	yes
1	and start dancing round in that open space but everybody was already sitting in comfy chairs and eating with the lights on
1	yes
1	so i would ve had to switch the lights off pause dur short turn the music up
1	yes
1	and just pause dur short cut across everybody s conversations
1	yes
1	trunc i trunc so so there was not much to be done really
1	no no there wasn t there wasn t erm erm trunc th trunc that s why some people pause dur short yeah well trunc th trunc they re interesting people to chat to as well pause dur short and interesting chats we had
1	yes oh you spoke to anon nametype f type name
1	er i
1	my friend anon nametype f type name in the trunc win trunc in the window seat
1	i did yes
1	she said oh that anon nametype m type name he was very frustrating he wouldn t say how he knew
1	didn t i
1	no vocal desc laugh she said i kept prodding him to say well how do you know how do you know her and you wouldn t reply vocal desc laugh
1	oh that s right that s right i didn t that s well
1	she said i had to give him a lecture in the end and tell him that trunc h trunc how could i could possibly start to play unclear more have a conversation with him unless i knew where he came from and you know vocal desc laugh
1	trunc th trunc that s very revealing of of anon nametype f type name isn t it yes but erm no i think i was i was going through a phase of not wanting to be pause dur short and i know one isn t pause dur short not not not wanting to trunc e trunc
1	yeah yeah let one in yeah
1	include include where we met
1	yes
1	in the definition of who i am
1	yes
1	erm pause dur short because
1	i know did you get on with her because she s very musical and her kids are really musical as well pause dur short did you find that out
1	i did i did i did er yes yes and i was a bit of jealous cos they were all all better than me er
1	ah
1	and yes i did i did discover that
1	how do you know not her singing necessarily
1	erm
1	but you re a singer aren t you rather than
1	yes
1	an instrumentalist
1	yes i am pause dur short yes
1	i only play silly things like bazooms
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	it is not the kind of thing that you take to a party in case somebody asks you to play
1	that s right that s right and and er yes yes yes there was a pause dur short yes so she was she was a good good good good person pause dur short and
1	she s very nice i ve known her for
1	and it s almost that i don t like to be defined pause dur short by by things like that anyway
1	no
1	so i pause dur short i did once go through a phase of not telling people what i what i did for a living pause dur short er and would refuse to say well you know let s let s talk about pause dur short erm what my view is on erm dwarf throwing
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and you know that s far more interesting than the boring old pause dur short erm
1	yes
1	trunc wh trunc what what do you do for a job you know what do you think about dwarf throwing
1	yes but anon nametype f type name was a very ardent feminist in my younger days pause dur short i used to go very unclear about you know these conversations about what do you do because you know erm you re gonna be defined by pause dur short by whether you got a job or if you haven t got a job pause dur short how much you get paid
1	yeah
1	how senior you are yes i know and one comes round to the same
1	you understand
1	debate over and over again
1	you re
1	different times unclear
1	yes yes yes you understand i know that s that s that s erm unclear
1	yeah
1	yeah yeah and it was pause dur short and everybody was i mean pause dur short yeah june and july this year was a pause dur short was a time of pause dur short er when i first got into that pause dur short period of thinking well trunc th trunc they re pause dur short it s not merely survival after pause dur short not just survival i m not just into survival i m actually into pause dur short into life after
1	mm
1	cancer treatments
1	mm
1	and that s pause dur short and trunc l trunc literally was pause dur short just pause dur short june pause dur short and july
1	really
1	it was the first time for
1	mm pause dur short cos you just cos you were erm
1	to erm
1	erm you got back into
1	unclear years
1	singing cos i remember you saying pause dur short either earlier this year or last year that you had stopped being interested in the things that you ve been interested in all your life and you just had no motivation and yet you said
1	right
1	you just spent sorry how many weeks have you spent away at summer school now or is it a week was it
1	yeah three three weeks three weeks
1	three weeks
1	three weeks yes
1	and trunc whi trunc whose whose summer school who organised it
1	erm trunc th trunc trunc th trunc pause dur short there were two trunc s trunc trunc s trunc summer schools one is called pause dur short er anon type place
1	alright at anon type place
1	trunc i trunc it was a charterhouse
1	uh
1	er trunc s trunc started by erm anon nametype m type name
1	ah
1	in nineteen forty six
1	ah the great anon nametype m type name
1	yeah vocal desc laugh erm pause dur short and erm has has run since then pause dur short and the other one is pause dur short was anon type place which started about nineteen fifty two pause dur short at anon type place
1	mm
1	and
1	but these
1	trunc a trunc
1	are these for singers for choirs for choirs
1	er they are for oh trunc ch trunc choirs solo singers orchestras of different sizes chamber orchestras string orchestras wind orchestras erm pause dur short er jazz pause dur short er piano componists and composers
1	oh fine
1	so there re there re pause dur short there s there re sessions on pause dur short the people who want to do all of those things
1	yeah
1	and as it happens pause dur short trunc e trunc trunc e trunc those charterhouses unclear decide they can make more money over the summer holidays er by letting up the school to erm pause dur short er sports pause dur short sports training for example
1	oh
1	trunc a trunc and so both summer schools had to move and they both pause dur short er have moved to anon type place in dorset
1	aha alright
1	so these run consecutively
1	right
1	er
1	and you went to both
1	i went to both yes
1	mm
1	it s cos some of the people who tutor on one tutor on the other as well
1	right
1	and
1	ah
1	so there s a bit of a bit of an overlap
1	yes and so erm you enjoyed it
1	yes yes very much very much very much yes erm
1	and do you wish to do you erm prefer being in a choir or do you like being a soloist
1	i prefer being a soloist
1	do you
1	yes yes i
1	and what s your what is your favourite trunc g trunc genre
1	oh pause dur short that er pause dur short that s difficult to say because pause dur short i keep on discovering pause dur short lovely music erm from all periods pause dur short so it depends pause dur short i mean i ve just discovered one by i took a song by thomas arne
1	arne a r n e
1	arne a r n e
1	yeah
1	who s famous because he pause dur short what s thomas arne famous for
1	i don t know
1	rule britannia
1	oh is he
1	yup
1	oh right see i trunc n trunc see music is one
1	yeah
1	huge gap see i m with i m like music like you are with literature vocal desc laugh
1	trunc r trunc right okay fair enough pause dur short trunc w trunc trunc w trunc
1	well not quite actually not quite as bad i m just not
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well i have admitted to reading george orwell and trunc th trunc that s that s
1	yes trunc th trunc that s true that s true yes
1	that s literature p g pause dur short wodehouse does that count as literature
1	yes pause dur short you d i d say he s a classic now cos you d been reading classics without knowing it
1	well pause dur short i could
1	i think that s trunc e trunc classics with a capital c or classics with a small c
1	right right
1	okay classics i suppose classics with a capital c obviously would be sort of a big set of pieces i guess
1	yes yes
1	and erm with a small c is just anything that is now deemed to be pause dur short a classic
1	right right
1	such as for example a few years ago in the guardian or the observer i can t remember which said these are the top hundred novels of all times and you really have got to read these novels
1	oh yes pause dur short yes
1	so i thought well and i cut it out
1	i do remember that
1	and i discarded the children s ones and i thought the j k pause dur short rowling rowling and erm oh what s his face well who s that extremely pompous sanctimonious person erm
1	erm philip pullman
1	yes
1	yeah
1	so i crossed those out cos i thought
1	yup
1	actually i m not reading those cos i m a grown up and i don t need to pause dur short read these things and then that left me with the rest pause dur short and so er and actually i set about for a few years trying to read all a trunc hun trunc well i had read i probably read about forty of them already or something trunc li trunc
1	yes
1	part of them all possibly more than that pause dur short so i then i set about trying to read the others pause dur short yes so which led me to things like don quixote pause dur short which
1	oh
1	actually as you said before with unclear trunc des trunc destevsky or deschevky unclear or whatever you call him
1	yeah
1	it depends on the quality of the translation
1	yeah yeah
1	because erm pause dur short don quixote in some translations is absolutely unreadable
1	yeah
1	and you cannot imagine for a second why it s on the top list hundred list of novels in fact it s very long
1	yes pause dur short yes
1	like if it was just length
1	yes
1	anyway
1	yes
1	so but erm pause dur short with erm pause dur short we were talking about your genres and you didn t really say
1	yes erm pause dur short so so so pause dur short er trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc there s since it happened with music generally over these last years i have listened to so much in the course that pause dur short like i ve been discovering more pause dur short good music from all stages so i i found one by thomas arne he s he was seventeen ten to seventeen pause dur short seventy eight or something like that
1	mm
1	and er wrote a lot of stuff pause dur short erm pause dur short some of which has been lost erm pause dur short and i found a lovely song pause dur short by him which is a bit in between baroque and classical
1	mm
1	so shift new singing o come o come my dearest and hither bring shift new normal and so on erm but i also sang one er sang a song from sixteen hundred and two
1	mm
1	by caccini erm which again i came across this year and pause dur short like very much and pause dur short oh pause dur short oh perhaps and perhaps a little bit like in pause dur short the earlier music erm sixteen hundreds perhaps
1	oh
1	purcell purcell s
1	oh right okay
1	purcell s pause dur short quite quite good erm pause dur short and quite erm quite rude at times
1	mm
1	which i quite enjoyed cos pause dur short vulgarity is one of my favourite genres
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm pause dur short what was the other one erm pause dur short oh and a mozart aria pause dur short that i heard some in the last year and thought i could wondered if i could do as well as the as the singer
1	oh right
1	between that
1	well
1	so trunc tha trunc that s that s sort of expand from pause dur short sixteen two pause dur short sixteen two to seventeen ninety pause dur short erm pause dur short so so pause dur short anyway pause dur short my favourite genre is the is the one i last did
1	okay
1	but erm but i ll i ll take the thomas arne for audition pieces for next term
1	mm
1	erm
1	oh do you have to audition to go to these places
1	erm no but next term pause dur short at anon type place er pause dur short trunc t trunc to join the opera group pause dur short what you do is you you audition you take a song and from what pause dur short the people turn up from the people who sign erm to to the producer she then decides what opera she wants to do with the voices that ve come forward
1	oh that s an interesting approach
1	which is yeah i trunc g trunc thinking about it it s actually a sensible thing to do
1	yeah
1	erm with the with the shifting
1	rather than swapping square pegs into round holes or whatever
1	exactly yeah
1	and i guess actually it s just the lack of unclear or whatever
1	yes yes erm pause dur short trunc e trunc trunc e trunc exactly exactly and and yes with a a shifting population that you haven t yet you know unclear then you ll you ll find that people are er yeah you trunc j trunc you just don t know who you re gonna get
1	mm
1	and who s pause dur short got a job and gone off and of the recent postgraduates
1	yeah
1	whose whose staying on for another year and whose
1	that must be frustrating as well losing people that you know you re thinking oh yes that s person is going to key up and be a central person here and they just wander off cos they get another job or their circumstance has changed or something
1	trunc e trunc trunc e trunc yes yes in fact pause dur short last year conducting the chamber choir was er trunc e trunc er somebody who was doing it for the first first time and she s primarily a school teacher and and it was a little bit er it was very clear that she pause dur short wasn t really pause dur short at ease with the undergraduate situation so
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know week three only half the choir turns up you know where are all the others well so and so s got an instrumental lesson and so and so s pause dur short got to get a composition invite tomorrow and so and so is not feeling well and erm
1	so tonight i m going to have fines if you don t turn up
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes so i was erm talking to trunc th trunc an art tutor that whose class i went to and we were talking about what make people go to art classes or not and er pause dur short and er you know the day of the week is quite is is quite important because a lot of people work part time
1	oh is it
1	well yeah no no i mean not
1	oh yes
1	any particular day of the week but any individual so trunc re trunc you know might not be able to come on a trunc particul trunc like us you know meeting on a tuesday evening
1	yes
1	erm there you know they d be i i can t come
1	of course
1	to class unless it s friday afternoon and he was cos he s a proper artist he was like oh you know
1	yes
1	why it should be effective by the lack of unclear if somebody s got a shift on a friday afternoon or whatever
1	yes
1	and then certainly in anon type place colleges they re very strict they they really tell you off they re phoning up these days asking where they trunc a trunc where you are if you don t turn up for classes
1	yes
1	because they only get paid by results so if you drop out
1	yes
1	or you don t turn up or only half the people wander in and they re late pause dur short then erm the tutor gets their wrists slapped
1	yes
1	so they actually now call you up they send you a text or something they say where are you
1	yes yes i i hadn t realised until last year pause dur short trunc th trunc that happens with undergraduates well as trunc y trunc as you know pause dur short it happens with undergraduates as well
1	i didn t know
1	oh yeah yeah erm
1	i only went to three lectures in the whole three years vocal desc laugh or something like that no it s probably a slight exaggeration but
1	yes trunc e trunc
1	but we learned early that if you wanted to drop out you had to drop out quick because if you were if you got down to the last sort of half dozen they started to realise who you were and certainly you could be followed up if you dropped out really early then nobody could quite track whether you were ever
1	right
1	supposed to have been there or not
1	vocal desc laugh yes yes it was it s a it s a bit more of a it s a bit more of a a a a sort of pause dur short market is not quite the right word pause dur short but it s it s pause dur short it s quite quite different now cos people are
1	mm
1	paying such vast fees for
1	mm
1	for erm for their for their education
1	yes well i think
1	er
1	we were all we were conscientious you couldn t pause dur short trunc y trunc trunc y trunc you know you were we were erm known well enough to know if you were skiving or not and people were followed up if they you know if they sort of disappeared pause dur short but and and actually pause dur short had a very good education because it was in such small groups and with things like tutorials so you know you know tutorial were only with only two or three other people so trunc o trunc one or two or other people so they certainly knew if you weren t there and if you hadn t done your essay
1	mm
1	so erm
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	so you couldn t pause dur short trunc r trunc really unclear pause dur short but it wasn t so
1	yeah
1	it trunc wasn trunc you weren t kept out as trunc e trunc you know it s not like flinging a register or something or
1	yeah yeah
1	perhaps trunc the trunc they left it more to us to be self disciplined
1	trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc they did they did but only a a lecture had to be rescheduled erm because a lecturer was ill
1	mm
1	vocal desc misc vocal desc laugh and er pause dur short erm at the reschedule lecture pause dur short as it was about to start erm pause dur short somebody said trunc i trunc i ll have to leave early pause dur short er so the lecturer said why and she was i ve i ve i ve got to go to my job pause dur short er and he said trunc w trunc trunc w trunc trunc w trunc trunc w trunc trunc w trunc what s your job trunc e trunc trunc e trunc it s it s in a restaurant and where s the restaurant he said in in soho
1	vocal desc misc
1	erm he was due on a pause dur short his shift started at twelve o clock
1	mm
1	at twelve midday so he got to leave erm pause dur short at er quarter past eleven pause dur short which it simply caught him out because er because of the change in the time it was on the day
1	yes
1	of the of the lecturer
1	yes
1	and and trunc tha trunc trunc tha trunc that s took me by surprise because i didn t realise pause dur short people actually having pause dur short having to work
1	when was this
1	this was last summer unclear
1	oh yeah no i think a lot of people work through
1	erm
1	now
1	they do they do but i mean one of the pause dur short first time round forty years ago er pause dur short one of our lecturers who was canadian by origin you know was terribly scornful of us
1	mm
1	getting grants and not having to pay tuition fees cos in trunc i trunc trunc i trunc when he was an undergraduate in canada and and america erm everybody er all students or most students worked
1	i can t see why that s desirable
1	erm
1	i really can t i mean i i suppose that that i m pause dur short well like like you from a sort of privileged time because not many people got to go to university
1	mm
1	you know
1	mm
1	and we were a very small percentage of our age who could go and er perhaps it s only now that i look at it and think quite clearly that was such a privilege
1	yeah
1	trunc i trunc and such a boon to have
1	yeah
1	that amount of money to be invested in you as an individual with no kind of expectation at the end of it erm
1	mm

1	well it s very selfish
1	is she
1	mm
1	well therefore you know pause dur short and did you not see that before or did you always know she was quite selfish
1	no i didn t realise it but she is
1	hm
1	first few years i didn t realise
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short well
1	i noticed just after anon nametype f type name was born
1	hm after anon nametype f type name was born
1	mm
1	began to see it pause dur short what why in what way
1	well when she was a baby she she still wanted to to go out started going out like she did trunc be trunc before she had her
1	unclear mm
1	yeah vocal desc sigh
1	and yet you said she wanted more children
1	yeah that s part of the chinese culture
1	mm pause dur short erm unclear she ll have more now
1	i i really don t know
1	mm that would be awful for anon nametype f type name as well pause dur short mind you if she s having to move to down there to erm
1	anon type place
1	anon type place she won t be able to go out and her mother won t have them two of them will she vocal desc laugh
1	well i can t see that anon nametype f type name would live at her mother s place i m sure she she d get her own
1	would she mm pause dur short what s it unclear what s
1	well it s terrible they live on unclear that unclear farm it s so dirty
1	is it
1	yeah horrible i mean the toilet is a hole next to the pigpens you you re squatting there over the hole and you ve got pigs grunting behind you
1	and anon nametype f type name won t go and live there then
1	i shouldn t think so
1	why why would she take anon nametype f type name there
1	well well because this problem with school in unclear i really
1	mm
1	we haven t got the right
1	to go to school
1	to to go to school there
1	and yet she has down there
1	well yeah cos that s where she s born she unclear
1	where anon nametype f type name was born
1	yeah
1	but not anon nametype f type name
1	well no no pause dur short but also she s got her mother er to to fall back on for
1	mm
1	looking after everyone
1	what s it what s it what does it cost to rent a property there then
1	well the flat that we were living in before i came over er it was er nine hundred quid a month for two bedrooms
1	nine hundred pounds
1	yeah
1	mm pause dur short but it s the same as it is here
1	for a month for a two bedroom flat
1	yeah
1	is it
1	yeah that s what anon nametype f type name s is
1	is it
1	mm pause dur short so they re quite expensive then
1	yes but they re not rising so much as here because er the property developers er were all counting on this never this boom unclear never ending and there are lots and lots of properties that are empty now
1	what in in china
1	as commercial pause dur short yeah yeah
1	mm
1	and people are waiting for the bubble to burst
1	mm pause dur short so in other words what does that mean that they re not gonna go up they ll start going down
1	they it was certainly i mean the stabilisation i should think well it depends on the area of course
1	mm what about the flats that you ve got unclear then unclear
1	no it s in it s not very er commercial area and er the the value hasn t really gone up er vocal desc cough as much as it has in other parts of the country and er so the rents are very very reasonable there
1	they are
1	mm
1	why did you buy in that area again
1	well that s that s where i was working and that s where er
1	oh right yeah yeah
1	anon nametype f type name was born and thought
1	mm mm
1	i i had no idea i d be moving on to university
1	mm mm pause dur short mm
1	and of course i like along with everybody else i thought well invest for the future
1	mm mm pause dur short but they haven t gone up much but what what sort of rents do they get then
1	very er only er a hundred pound each a month
1	you only get a hundred pound
1	each pause dur short for each one
1	that s odd isn t it
1	yeah well
1	is is that is that
1	it s a very small it s only like er well a one bedroom flat
1	they re small
1	small small flats
1	mm mm pause dur short mm pause dur short well where you were working this last time
1	anon type place oh it s er
1	thriving
1	yeah
1	mm
1	absolutely
1	mm pause dur short that s a shame pause dur short shame it s not bought there and not in the other place but
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short what would there likely to be where she s gonna go then in anon type place
1	i ve got no idea er it should be quite cheap though
1	mm
1	yeah should be
1	well pause dur short and where s the school compared with erm where they re
1	well the school won t be as good because this is er fairly upmarket establishment that s
1	mm private unclear
1	unclear she goes private education and er
1	mm
1	lots of people got kids in there and
1	mm
1	lots of people have got their kids in there
1	mm
1	and er pause dur short it s yeah it s erm it s not cheap
1	no
1	it was actually started apparently by a a guy who started out er rummaging through dustbins and rubbish bins and sort of selling stuff or that kind of thing and er he just built it up built it up er and then
1	but how would he how did he start it then
1	well i i don t know the details but he started making a lot of money and one thing came to another and er eventually er created this school it s huge absolutely huge
1	mm
1	yeah but there s so many wealthy people over there its got unclear to be unclear the most billionaires in the world
1	mm mm pause dur long
1	but it s like most places in the world the the gap between the rich and poor is ever widening
1	mm of course yeah pause dur short what erm this school fees how do that how do the school fees compare then to other school fees there you know they unclear is that unclear
1	i don t know about other private schools really er there s erm one i think another one that the er the the head guy in universities his wife worked in it s called the international school and i think their prices were er quite high as well
1	so so five thousand is a unclear
1	erm maybe maybe even more expensive
1	is it five is it how much theirs is five thousand a what
1	pounds a year
1	a year
1	mm
1	that that compared with what i mean obviously you re talking about your flat is what you pay here but a private school here would be astronomical
1	mm
1	in comparison
1	mm
1	i mean erm i think you re talking something like twenty thousand a year now prices
1	a year
1	yeah yeah
1	wow
1	private schools are just over the top
1	really pause dur short oh
1	unclear unbelievable and that s why people move to areas where there are good schools
1	mm
1	that you know and so they ve unclear bought unclear property in an area where there s good schools go up
1	mm
1	so and and that that this area is one of the best is not that we knew that or or that anon nametype f type name knew it but erm pause dur short anon type place school has got a good trunc rep trunc it s a teaching school they teach other teachers there
1	ah
1	you know they all go to that school for
1	mm
1	you know tuition unclear er or to lead the way share best practice and you know help other teachers
1	mm
1	it s a very good school pause dur short but erm you know like when anon nametype m type name was at his private school that was about fifteen thousand set between twelve and fifteen thousand a year
1	is that warranted
1	hm
1	spending that amount of money on his education seeing that he s gone into a a manual
1	well pause dur short yeah but he he is dyslexic
1	oh was he ah
1	yeah oh yeah and so s anon nametype m type name
1	is he
1	oh yes and anon nametype m type name is yeah
1	really
1	mm yeah yeah but erm they had to fight to get him in that school fight to get him a place there
1	oh
1	yeah anon nametype m type name s dyslexic and and erm and anon nametype m type name is unclear run through the mail side of unclear i don t know where it i mean i would think anon nametype m type name is probably dyslexic as well i don t know don t really know and anon nametype m type name
1	it s all greek to him
1	hm no yeah erm but anon nametype m type name is i m sure dyslexic but he s one of those extremely i mean do the definition dyslexic is that you re a trunc ra trunc average or above average but with specific difficulties well anon nametype m type name has got no difficulties with money but erm if you ask him to sit down and write letters he wouldn t do it very well erm and anon nametype m type name is very good at lots of things
1	mm
1	but again it ll be sitting down writing a letter or keeping his book anon nametype m type name s quite good at keeping well he s not at keeping his books anon nametype f type name has to do it but and so does anon nametype m type name unclear but i mean anon nametype m type name is one of those who always says you know you do this this is your job and my job is that and i ll pay someone to do it that s anon nametype m type name s approach he s earn the money he s he s so good with money so fast working out not you know if you say about buying property or whatever he will tell you not just how much it will cost you he ll work it out but all of the additional costs that you won t think about
1	mm
1	he ll have it all in his head he s so good with property very good pause dur short and that he does this is erm commercial property because he doesn t they have full repairing lease they have to pay for the repairs
1	mm
1	and erm his his erm commercial properties are rented out and they have to it s ten year leases they have to have enough money up front for collateral for him to rent them out for ten years
1	mm
1	in other words they could pay ten years rent without
1	mm
1	and the repairs without pause dur short you know they ve got enough collateral for that
1	mm
1	erm that s why he chose he chooses that
1	mm
1	but pause dur short er i don t know pause dur short anon nametype m type name doesn t pause dur short he s not unclear but anon nametype m type name is very good you know anon nametype m type name has never ever painted a wall in the house or done any wood work he he s never done anything in the house he ll always get to pay someone to do it whereas anon nametype m type name has done everything in the house you know
1	mm
1	he did all the wood flooring in that other house put in the kitchen tiled it all the worktops erm putting in a new did the bathroom a beautiful bathroom that last one and you know and he s now done loads of work on the garden can t build walls but anon nametype f type name can but they they did their erm they had a bricklayer come in and like like ours they dug it all out and took put the patio in in the space in front and had a wall built and they had a brick unclear and came in he unclear wall and he put in one set of steps at one end and anon nametype f type name and anon nametype m type name did the other end and they re better than the bricklayer s steps

0	oh my god it s a fucking conker

0	yeah
0	mm
0	mm
0	in korea they eat them they kinda look like conkers but look a bit different and they re like
0	horse sweet chestnuts

0	around where
0	england

0	yeah
0	yeah that s the problem i don t know if i m not putting enough oil in or something pause dur short i made a mistake as well you know you re meant to put a bit of oil on top with a bit of paprika or something on er on the top of the thing
0	mm
0	chickpeas
0	no i think it s
0	i i tried doing with that only it didn t quite taste right
0	no
0	what s gone wrong
0	too crumbly or
0	if i tend to put the flour in at the end and i m done but erm i ve my falafel s been good i ll tell you what s not what s kind of er might make it a bit more crumbly but sometimes i freeze them and they hold together quite well
0	yeah
0	i don t fry them though i put them
0	mm they re good for you
0	yeah i eat quite a bit of chickpeas they re cheap so it s a good source of protein
0	and they just get a bit boring then don t they
0	bit of cucumber
0	you can mix it up a bit don t you
0	yeah yeah pause dur short the problem is having time as well to do this shit
0	it s all in the preparation
0	yeah
0	you can just use like anything on it pause dur short i reckon erm
0	i make my own naan i do that
0	no i mean i would say flour and water would be more like chapatti but there s again variations of the recipe but when i make naan i use egg and trunc mi trunc i don t use water i use milk erm and then i ll probably put a little a little bit of baking powder in there
0	erm but i don t have a tandoori oven or nothing so it would just i stick it in the oven and it it rises a little bit and it s maybe i ll put a bit of coriander in it or something like that
0	i think they ll be pretty easy to make
0	cos i know when they ve made greek bread they ve put milk in it sometimes
0	yeah pause dur short i ll tell you what was really good mate when i was in china last time there s they ve got a type of bread there called baba bread

0	chai
0	they call it chai in cyprus

0	yeah
0	when i saw her for the first time down at the hospital i could see it but i think that was also due to stress

0	but like she your mum i know it bothers her like cos i ve heard you tell me before and i ve heard some some of the stuff she says and stuff like that and i m just like it s and when i know people are like that i always make a conscious effort to tell them like you look really nice today like

0	yeah pause dur long
0	that s just where you have to come in i guess
0	and without making it into a problem or sounding nasty or anything i think you just have to keep an eye on her
0	and make sure that it doesn t become a problem

0	that would be a good place to live
0	okay so yeah so i ll do the shopping and the ironing in which ever order pause dur short i ll work out which i d rather do pause dur short then erm yeah then basically whatever you fancy pause dur short i mean i will need to know before oh yeah if i do the ironing first actually cos i will need to know what we re doing other people wise
0	oh pause dur short that s not cool
0	well i well if you ask him today pause dur short if he can t do today he could do tomorrow
0	and possibly anon nametype m type name pause dur short we ll see pause dur short depends what sort of mood he s in
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short as you say do it when you get in and just see what he says pause dur short i mean do you think you might go and just explain that you it trunc ha trunc it has to be non impact
0	yeah i know pause dur short i mean two weeks isn t too bad but i m not
0	doctor nurse
0	yeah
0	yes pause dur short decent internet will also be good pause dur short christ pause dur short when are we actually going to get that
0	mm pause dur short well it would improve it even without actually that s an interesting question cos the current exchange is so shit that would the non fibre stuff be any good any better than it currently is and it may not be
0	non trunc fi trunc in the sense that
0	so for example my parents before they signed up to fibre they had normal broadband and it was a damn sight better than ours currently is
0	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short yes pause dur short erm i don t actually know whether it would make it any better or not
0	mm
0	i ve well i think i found it once and have been unable to find it since probably
0	well what was it oh since yeah pause dur short well we ll go on again and have another look and if there s a phone number or some kind of contact them i ll contact them on on monday and just ask what s going on and you know do a bit of shouting pause dur short i do a very good complain phone call now pause dur short i m well rehearsed having bought a house from taylor wimpy
0	ah
0	ah
0	it s alright chuck pause dur short yeah
0	i know pause dur short i want my book
0	no it s not worth it
0	hmm nice pause dur short i m always selling it pause dur short selling my lies to er to people to try and get free stuff pause dur short i love it pause dur short however it s my job to vouchers
0	no erm pause dur long i mean er unclear observation is that pause dur short it would be pause dur short unclear a good way of putting it erm i think heather is in some ways quite bipolar
0	erm in the sense of i think she behave she s a very different people around for different people
0	and to some extent it might be nicer if unclear if she made an effort to be fun and engaging around you
0	yeah
0	i don t understand how you could drink like a fish in certain situations and then have absolutely nothing in the other
0	trunc vers trunc yeah versus really going out and having like yeah shots with friends from uni pause dur short just kind of pause dur short i don t know yeah i kind of pause dur short i just get the impression that she s a a massive seething ball of nerves and neurosis and when she s with her friends she s kind of yeah more more relaxed and and that kind of thing pause dur short but maybe it s still there underneath and she s just pretending and it s easier to pretend when she s not with me pause dur short and with me she just doesn t worry too much and it s just a massive pause dur short yeah i just get the impression that she s on edge a lot of the time
0	it s absolutely disgusting pause dur short erm she used to bite her nails and she stopped biting her nails but started picking like the edges around pause dur short and yeah the skin s just off pause dur short it s horrible pause dur short it s absolutely disgusting pause dur short and i ve said to her your fingers are going to get infected
0	mm pause dur short well she s constantly doing this and just moving her hands and it really really gets on my nerves because it looks vile pause dur short it can t be comfortable for her pause dur short her fingers must ache pause dur short and i and i said they re going to get infected pause dur short you know pause dur short this isn t good pause dur short and she said oh i know you know and is bothered pause dur short i said have you tried hypnotherapy because genuinely like you need to stop doing it
0	there s a big rock in the middle of the drive
0	yeah i see it
0	yeah sure i ll i ll go and move it
0	so i m l i kissed a girl once and it was nice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	at what point would you erm
0	in your
0	so when you
0	vocal desc laugh
0	right yeah
0	erm and you basically
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh so surely you just
0	no no that s the thing is that most people at the beginning vote for the people that get it wrong but beyond that cos you trunc wa trunc you want people to get it right
0	oh my goodness it s
0	yeah
0	oh my goodness
0	you know try and oust me
0	so you get say five hundred vocal desc laugh
0	five grand
0	at that stage it
0	then that five grand is saved so that they have five grand that round regardless
0	mm
0	erm and then basically the person at the end who when they get to the last two then they have a sudden death so whoever gets the question wrong first loses and the other person gets the prize money
0	so the chances of you actually winning this game are pretty slim
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and you d be like why are you doing this so that s
0	vocal desc laugh
0	anne just like okay unclear
0	she s richard
0	she s basically richard the third isn t she
0	and that wink every time she was like you are the weakest link goodbye and then wink and it was just trunc su trunc you could feel
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh so erm that s
0	you were just they she d be like you are the weakest link goodbye and you d kind of just sit there and be like i need a hug
0	the scenario is
0	noel knobhead edmonds
0	er okay so
0	he does
0	ten thousand
0	every time it s just they re like yeah so you ve got rid of everything under the ten grand limit except ten pence and one penny and the banker s like i ll offer you two hundred vocal desc laugh it s just and you re like no you re just vocal desc laugh laws of probability are kind of you know hugely in my favour now vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	haven t quite healed over there for that
0	which side do you want
0	vocal desc laugh words
0	he erm
0	oh
0	turn up on the door and get it oh we can t it s a matinee isn t it do you wanna go to the matinee
0	yeah
0	there you go good idea so either way we re unclear flogging a unclear unclear
0	great pause dur short that s good
0	nailed it erm yeah yeah
0	er trunc ex trunc er discuss and explore the idea of
0	no no certainly
0	i can t yeah so the theories of media and the
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i want your opinion on the matter
0	uhu
0	i would agree entirely but trunc th trunc as i d say this this wasn t a springboard for me to say you re wrong this was a springboard for me to say you re right
0	mm
0	overtly nice to a point where it isn t representative it s absolutely not i mean if you take a look at the the yeah that looks perfect if you take a look at the trunc confl trunc the conflict within it the main conflict of the of high school musical is that troy bolton is too talented as the main as the main character it s not that he has a flaw
0	does he take up a scholarship in a
0	yeah
0	and then beyond that
0	it s erm er pause dur short er
0	trunc bu trunc mm
0	oh yeah but it does also kind of imply that to do well in life you erm kind of need to go into wait no how does it end i i would suggest that it does imply that
0	he s he s with his friends isn t he
0	and he also stays with his friends
0	in high school musical unfortunately
0	are they saying are they saying you trunc sh trunc that you should and that is
0	so
0	erm which obviously
0	supposed to trunc y trunc trunc sat trunc
0	is flying
0	yeah
0	mm
0	and you know harmful but yeah what what were you going to say
0	mm
0	you for instance the guy who s in it baking
0	vocal desc cough
0	or it s really shunned and he s found it from some role model and he s got it whereas his basketball is what his family wanted him to pause dur short do so it s all these passions aren t things that are like pause dur short great things that we should be championing they re just other types of norms
0	if we re going
0	this is my opinion of life generally
0	i
0	and i m pleased yes mm like erm example being pause dur long
0	what what
0	it can t be it can t be so it can t be erm a musical oh it could be a musical instrument if they taught it themselves pause dur short like they just found a musical instrument and taught them themselves the musical instrument
0	then in the same way that that goes if someone just picks up an instrument and you know starts playing it are they not learning that instrument through whoever created that instrument pause dur long music is the rearranging of notes in the same way that creative writing is rearranging of words
0	purely just for my own cause my personal belief erm beyond ruining you in that argument vocal desc laugh
0	erm my personal belief
0	in the same way that the guitar s constructed
0	furthering your argument reductio ad absurdum is where you take an argument and then you
0	exaggerate it
0	yeah but that wasn t ridiculous
0	that wasn t completely
0	trunc ye trunc no no no no no no
0	no i didn t say he was taught but it by it did i
0	in reading a book am i taught by the author and you said oh good point to an extent
0	you are because if they weren t alive the the the thing
0	no no
0	by the music that you re making with it pause dur short the medium is irrelevant the book is irrelevant the musical instrument itself is irrelevant the art that you re creating with it the notes the writing that you are writing
0	is what is relevant that is the passion pause dur short there s a difference between reading a book as an art and writing as an art in the same way that there s a difference between playing an instrument and the creation of an trunc influ trunc instrument
0	is there really
0	why is it a strong oh no okay yeah okay okay
0	it s a brilliant discussion vocal desc laugh
0	erm
0	yes it would
0	definition here are you talking about art in the mind of the outsider
0	or
0	as in pause dur short as in would they have something of their passion unclear about unclear pause dur short i guess would tie our argument
0	back nicely wouldn t it
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah no the the question there the very crux of it is pause dur short are are humans animal or are they something more are we built to survive or are we built to thrive that s what we re coming to here
0	vocal desc laugh anon type place it s vocal desc laugh
0	maybe
0	i started to build a i ve separated my seminars next week into three separate documents and i m just pasting over the quotes that i think might be useful for that particular day
0	definitely
0	erm well we ve been doing it for a few months now vocal desc laugh haven t we
0	and do the readings that they ve set me to do
0	no i emailed the language description analysis lady cos although she s given me a load of pre readings she hasn t actually set us anything to do
0	yes exactly
0	so as long as i can participate in that respect of it unclear i don t know what more unclear
0	well that i do one to trunc th trunc
0	oh then i do the first hour then
0	but just for me that seems a bit mm harsh think about
0	it s not just for you it s for everyone oh
0	yeah
0	with these added sessions
0	that s quite long days
0	mm
0	and i ve got two full long days like that you haven t got shit that even compares to that
0	i m not
0	i don t study do you want a cigarette by the way i ve rolled one
0	erm
0	the lecture that you had that morning unclear
0	i know i know
0	you ll have oh okay yeah yeah
0	i m gonna have to
0	yeah it s just a lot more work for me pause dur short that s all but it can t really be avoided can it
0	but it s still a lesser weight
0	i wonder why it must build on unclear some of the theory that they have in unclear unclear i don t know why they won t unclear offer it to an undergrad
0	research in language and use erm i don t really understand how it works it s fifteen credits the same as pidgins and creoles yeah
0	and syntactic theory in research in language and use we do one and a half research in language and use is just two papers and the other ones i ve got presentations and four papers
0	i guess the er yeah unclear no they re not unclear i guess the research in language and use is just er the trunc cr trunc you know they put the minimum amount of credit they can to it or something unclear and that s unclear
0	i don t know
0	i guess it s it s the they re trunc s trunc trying to give us ideas during that time
0	i know i actually thought there would be less contact time erm than there is going to be certainly unclear
0	yeah
0	it s certainly not cheap is it
0	i mean certain masters cost different amounts unclear unclear you do unclear
0	unclear you know unclear yeah i know science masters i trunc w trunc i don t know how much did anon nametype m type name say how much his cost unclear there unclear
0	i mean all the ones at the trunc t trunc top ten unis cost unclear like unclear eight or nine unclear pretty much unclear
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	if you ve got a good idea for your masters
0	turn into phds continue that
0	cos you ve already got half the word count or all of the word count depending on
0	it doesn t make any sense does it and you you ve er your dissertation s gonna have to be based on what you re taught you know
0	they may be weighted to such a point that you are just because it s history you re
0	that you can yeah
0	i don t know it depends on er
0	but it s harder for them
0	yep
0	you they have a language department that you can use
0	unclear yeah no unclear
0	yeah
0	and therefore we write less words
0	yeah he said something about
0	language variation has got a huge scope and er blah blah blah and he said well that s why we cover these different points so that you can find the area that you wanna research
0	yeah well there s a five thousand word essay and
0	what s that on
0	unclear
0	well in the trunc f trunc yeah i suppose by that point i ve would ve practised but
0	i d imagine it s in a different area
0	oh does that come in the summer term unclear though unclear
0	so we still need seventy five
0	yeah well in the spring term we still do another core module
0	mm
0	probably unclear in here somewhere
0	yeah
0	yeah so
0	if yeah if i could do trunc phrenolo trunc yeah i mean i ve got the core i d like to be kind of what she is a little bit
0	first language acquisition interests me i find it quite fascinating what children do and how they learn languages and that may go very well with your second language acquisition
0	yeah unclear
0	unclear discourse and communication analysis i m a little bit concerned she s nice but
0	i reckon she s yeah i reckon she s she s very strict
0	yeah
0	so it s not a bad thing they might actually be better teachers for it but
0	yeah definitely
0	erm it will probably be harder but discourse and communication analysis if that is actually about you know like things that you ve recorded and then analysing it that s gonna be unclear bloody unclear useful
0	yeah yeah it would be pretty useful
0	so she s doing four
0	yeah she is she s unclear
0	so if you already know pidgins and creoles you can take a qualification in it
0	but i trunc ha trunc i don t know trunc pidg trunc i haven t actually been
0	yeah you could certainly unclear help explain things for me
0	so i mean you could do pidgins and creoles and come out they might be like oh cheeky but
0	but you could come out with quite a good grade unclear
0	mm so what do we have to do research proposal
0	i wouldn t mind semantics discourse trunc w trunc
0	and it s very perceptive
0	yeah well that s why unclear i yeah unclear
0	research proposal this module will provide specific guidance for your dissertation to help you in the choice of a research topic type of research project and appropriate methodology will work in conjunction with the presentations given by the english language and linguistics staff during the year
0	it s just part of the course unclear man unclear they work you
0	and then the language class on top of that i have
0	yeah vocal desc laugh you do
0	we re gonna be busy unclear
0	yeah
0	like and we still have to have a job and see people and go shopping and clean and all the normal stuff
0	yeah
0	is this up to date now has it got
0	anon nametype m type name
0	interesting
0	if you read his little blurb about him his that s his area
0	yeah yeah yeah
0	unclear
0	and you make a module handbook
0	english language
0	mm
0	yeah yeah yeah
0	no i mean it s like if you re organised and you know what you re doing then their job shouldn t actually be too bad
0	mm it s definitely gonna be strange being with a bunch of undergraduates by the sounds of things unless one of these other people that we haven t met yet have chosen it or i guess somebody on a part time module has done it
0	mm
0	i could be the only masters student in there
0	we could ve trunc s trunc should ve emailed this to anon nametype m type name unclear i guess they were gonna show it to us unclear so forensic linguistics is twice and pidgins and creoles is twice
0	yeah
0	the other one is the
0	is that all she does
0	oh no she does first language acquisition interesting pause dur short fair if you could teach any of these modules which would you go for
0	we have to effectively just start and unclear they ll stop unclear
0	doing all this kind of shit
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh man it sucks i basically have to get home and just crack on like immediately
0	mm
0	there s days that i trunc s trunc wake up at seven unclear though and i m unclear obviously gonna study unclear admittedly i m at home but i do i will be waking up at seven and i ll be in a classroom until eight pm
0	i ll just get more and more tired and then study unclear days i think unclear tuesdays are gonna be unclear quite unclear quite tiring
0	than when you did it before because you do you like have
0	unclear there s there s unclear a hell of a lot to study though
0	we have eggs
0	we can have egg a little bit of baguette still
0	we never re potted these things
0	you have to give this erm lemon grass a drink unclear trunc ever trunc every few er days unclear
0	i do have respect for people though that have just out of a moral obligation will not eat meat because of the way we treat animals
0	i think that s good but it s very hard to come across someone that s so passionate like so unclear kinda unclear disciplined that they don t eat eggs or
0	basically vegan i think
0	true vegans are very difficult to come across unclear
0	imprisons the animal or erm lactates it puts it in the unclear pen instead of free unclear
0	but
0	i don t know
0	we ve got four eggs
0	oh you were thinking scrambled egg veg wrap cheese
0	or unclear although that unclear meat s unclear not good
0	i like broccoli obviously
0	erm we can just
0	do you need milk to scramble cos that s not i m not sure that s good milk
0	oh has it gone off
0	vocal desc yawn right yeah don t do that so
0	well put it down here now it s gone pause dur short alright

0	yeah
0	i need quite small little convenient ones something i can like you know
0	yeah the lid doesn t fit on that
0	unclear maybe unclear another one that is kinda like
0	i need batteries as well for this recording thing do we need to write this stuff down
0	erm no i don t see it
0	down there by my behind you
0	erm is there anything else unclear
0	before monday

0	there was also that other shop near there wasn t there do you remember that weird little hardware store that you went into
0	and then er
0	how many hours have we got so far unclear
0	we re gonna finish this month with about twenty five
0	but no more
0	that s the plan
0	yeah i don t know if we re still gonna make our target er i mean we might do
0	yeah do you think she would
0	if he spoke a bit more at certain points then unclear
0	are you sure you don t want me to peel it
0	erm i dunno what do you think piece of fruit or something
0	unclear good unclear carry it in your bag with all your books
0	i ll just do it yeah is this knife clean have you been using it for something
0	what about er thursday wednesday thursday trunc lun trunc er dinner
0	yeah but then we were gonna do beef unclear
0	yeah
0	mm that would be nice yeah have we had a keema since we ve been here
0	i feel like if you made a nice solid keema wrap even if you could find the biggest wrap you could
0	yeah
0	and just take it already made cos it s just like it goes quite dry so it shouldn t get too saucy if you cook it down properly
0	no
0	i ve got a bit of a hectic day on friday bit worried that i m going to my family at the weekend when i need to be studying unclear
0	yeah will you be taking your do you know how you re getting from anon type place to anon type place yet
0	oh he is what time do you get into anon type place that evening
0	okay
0	and obviously i ve paid for my train back unclear
0	probably a good idea to always keep a pack of sausages in the freezer or something that we can use for unclear if you unclear want a bit more for lunch one day or something
0	just a pack of pork
0	yeah have we seen any pork
0	that might be a bit unclear really nice unclear
0	that they need whisking into a thing
0	i guess it s for people that don t eat erm red meat
0	unclear
0	after this
0	i suppose we don t have to have the curry with wraps tonight could have it with rice or something
0	oh we could have it with wedges or something
0	yeah we could make some wedges that might be quite tasty mightn t it
0	no unclear it s unclear
0	i know i just you shouldn t ve started whisking it i could ve got some out
0	it ll be fine unclear won t even taste it unclear
0	unclear well it s not unclear shut up unclear unclear where is the trunc pep trunc the paprika i can t even find it

0	grab us that little bit of butter pause dur short fry those eggs
0	do you want it in wraps unclear
0	unclear and erm once i add the eggs to it they soak up a bit of the sauce as well
0	not a lot but a bit enough is this water fresh is this what i poured a minute ago unclear
0	are you sure
0	it looks like a fairly nice day again
0	it s a unclear

0	yeah get some in for the week
0	need to kind of get er
0	i m so glad there s a shop like aldi around
0	i mean they do you can t just lie about that so if it s from england there s a standard
0	cheaper shops yeah
0	cos the british public are not paid enough there are still plenty of people that go to tesco s and plenty of people who go to sainsbury s and all these places
0	some people just have to
0	compared to korea it s definitely cheaper
0	yeah it is unclear
0	yeah i m not expecting anything to i mean some might go up by a few pence from inflation or something but i m not expecting the price of actually any produce to really change unclear
0	yeah but that s for er storage reasons i suppose
0	it s not like people buy like freezer trunc loa trunc freezer load of trunc pro trunc produce or meat or unclear anything unclear
0	unclear
0	vocal desc laugh i mean
0	so i ve gotta eat dinner on my own

0	yeah
0	yeah it is quite a while i mean thankfully you re doing like beginners french
0	yeah rather than just
0	unclear
0	if i m gonna do a language lesson in twenty weeks it would be nice for it to unclear
0	i ll probably catch up with you in about a month of rosetta stone or whatever
0	you can erm
0	what you said i m turning it on and i said what already or something and then
0	unclear yeah but you trunc s trunc you still turned it on
0	which you and you haven t done the cheese what have you done
0	i ve been cleaning we were making space

0	or will it not sear it in the way you want to
0	erm
0	yeah it will just cook it slower i guess
0	tea s unclear hasn t it
0	it s getting warm but er you might find it heats up quicker though if it s got two metal bits together than if it s got unclear
0	something in between it
0	but erm anyway unclear
0	there s logic to everything i say
0	yeah unclear unclear that s good unclear
0	i ve no idea but that is some terrible cleaning
0	unclear
0	no if only this was trunc eg trunc er chicken and not egg pause dur short unclear there i ve taken unclear to folding it right over unclear pause dur short oh what that s the first time that s ever happened to me
0	unclear
0	that s game over isn t it
0	why i ll just eat this as it is it doesn t bother me
0	you just i ll just eat this as it is you only get one
0	why did you get two if you have two then yeah
0	like that
0	or that can go on when yours goes on and then i ll just eat this one
0	yeah do you want me to bring that one through i m just eating this one unclear
0	i feel like there was a bit too much in it

0	like i had no plans to be in that position by the time i was twenty five like
0	no

0	trunc cha trunc chatting away pause dur short well i m sorry it took us a lot longer
1	hello anon nametype f type name pause dur short erm pause dur short right you re going to talk about your childhood experiences today pause dur short what would you say pause dur short really stands out to you pause dur short when you look back on that on those times
1	one of my earliest experiences when i was about pause dur short two years old pause dur short and my brother pause dur short was taken very poorly with appendicitis and was rushed into hospital pause dur short and because in those days there were no antibiotics pause dur short he went on to get pause dur short septicaemia pause dur short and i can remember my father taking me down to the local hospital to see him pause dur short i wasn t allowed in but i could look at him through the window because children were not allowed in the hospital at that time pause dur short when he was due to come home pause dur short then we went down with father to collect him pause dur short and not having a car at that time we collected him in a taxi and brought him home pause dur short and it was just lovely to have him back home after so many months not having him around it felt so good at that time pause dur short one of my next experiences would be i suppose about when i was about three or four pause dur short my grandmother lived with us pause dur short and she had a lovely bedroom with pictures all around the walls erm some which had texts from the bible and pictures and a lovely big double bed with a feather mattress pause dur short and i used to love to go into her pause dur short feather mattress bed and snuggle up beside her pause dur short and she would tell me stories pause dur short and i knew the stories well because she would say well which story do you want today and i would say oh this one please nana and she would say pause dur short oh you ve heard that one before and i would say oh yes i know but i want to hear it again so that was erm pause dur short one of my earliest memories pause dur short i suppose erm i was only two when war broke out so there were many memories as war pause dur short took hold pause dur short and i think my father was called up when pause dur short i was just pause dur short three and a half pause dur short to go with his call up papers and i can remember the call up papers i didn t know they were that but being put through the letterbox pause dur short and pause dur short having great distress in the family with my mother crying and nana upset er because father had got to go and leave the family home and go to serve in the forces pause dur short so that s another sort of thing that i really stands out in my memory as a little young child that that took place pause dur short and obviously in time erm then he had to go and we were on our own we had quite a big house and because we had a big house pause dur short we were pause dur short obliged to have pause dur short lodgers pause dur short we weren t allowed to have any free rooms where pause dur short they were free and no one slept in them so we had quite a series of lodgers coming in to the family home which was quite a strange feeling really erm to have strangers among us but my mother and grandmother being such good cooks i think they all thought they were onto a good place for staying and we certainly made them as comfortable as we possibly could pause dur short as a child pause dur short i remember during the war because pause dur short we might be in a location where bombs might drop pause dur short we had what they would call in those days not an outside shelter we had to go into but my erm mother and grandmother we had a big pause dur short like erm an iron pause dur short shelter cage in which my brother and myself were made to sleep pause dur short erm just us two children pause dur short and we were shut in there during the night and i slept at one end and my brother slept at the other end and he always used to make a fuss i remember about oh he didn t like little sister s feet poking in him erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh and erm i used to probably make a bit of a fuss about this and we there we were both in this cage erm pause dur short i i remember that vividly and pause dur short because pause dur short er mother was a bit sort of anxious about us erm she also had a bed in that room pause dur short and i remember one time when father came home on a very short leave before he was going to france erm it was over a christmas period pause dur short and pause dur short at the morning when we were let out erm we used to love to come and romp on the bed erm mother would be up but father was you know it s so lovely to have him back he would play erm pause dur short well games with us and we would do things like head over the heels and trunc si trunc you know funny things like that well least i did as a girl pause dur short and pause dur short on one occasion it created great panic on the boxing day pause dur short because i did a head over heels so far that i went over the end of the bed
1	oh
1	and i hit my head on the corner of the iron shelter
1	oh
1	and pause dur short i obviously knocked myself out pause dur short and when i came to i trunc lef trunc let out the most horrendous shrieking and crying they d ever heard in the household
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and there was great panic stations with me because boxing day my head bleeding and oh dear it was i was in a state and so were they vocal desc laugh so anyway it was decided i had to be taken down to the local hospital erm which was quite a little distance away pause dur short so pause dur short how were we to get there because as i said earlier we had no car at that time and obviously buses were not running and there didn t seem to be taxis about at that stage i don t know pause dur short but anyway the next door neighbours to us they had erm children too of a much younger age and they had a little pushchair pause dur short and so the pushchair was borrowed from next door and i was wheeled down to the pause dur short accident and emergency i suppose department erm it wasn t called that in those days but the equivalent as that today er and there erm my head was shaved at the back and i erm pause dur short wound cleaned and then i had a little row of stitches put in pause dur short erm pause dur short and pause dur short i suppose i was erm you know told i was a good girl and erm pause dur short i d been very brave erm and then they were i was brought home and then we had you know some treats erm pause dur short and i was made a great fuss of which was trunc rath trunc vocal desc laugh which was rather nice but i it s something i always remember in my childhood so that s another memory that really stands out vividly for me pause dur short erm pause dur short later on in the war my father when he was in france had quite a bad accident pause dur short and he had to be brought back home to pause dur short erm this country our own country to go into a military hospital he had erm as i called it in those days erm broken his spine
1	oh
1	and he was erm pause dur short very poorly for a long while and in fact my mother said he was never the same man again erm really for the rest of his life pause dur short but as he progressed and he was allowed out in due course of hospital they trunc h trunc were given erm a blue uniform so that people would know that they were not people who were not willing to fight but that they were soldiers and they were pause dur short invalided out of the forces and they were given this blue uniform and he came home and i can remember erm pause dur short mother went to get him and i was with granny and then we went to meet them coming off the bus not far from really a large park we had near us and i remember my parents walking arm in arm erm pause dur short so lovely and i was skipping along in front of them and pause dur short to come back home they were coming home and it was just such a joyous moment i remember that skipping through the park trunc w trunc as we you know came home again so that was another lovely little memory pause dur short erm school days erm pause dur short it was still the war when i went to school and started my primary school we had our own little classroom and playground separate from the erm pause dur short larger children i suppose who d moved on and been there a year pause dur short and pause dur short we had milk at break times pause dur short and it was we had to take our own mugs to have it in and i think we used to have like little enamel mugs and erm pause dur short milk was dolloped out from a milk churn for us pause dur short and in the bitter cold winter weather we got on the east side of the country er drinking this cold milk which i was not very keen on at all erm from this churn erm vocal desc laugh is another memory i have erm pause dur short later on i suppose pause dur short erm pause dur short i had a change of school because pause dur short we had er a bomb drop at the end of our road and this is still doing when my father was in the forces and we were evacuated trunc w trunc my brother and myself with my mother erm up to stay with an aunt and uncle in anon type place pause dur short and my cousin lived there so there were two boys and just me as a little girl and the two boys well they were pause dur short erm pause dur short probably a bit of nuisance to erm erm aunt and uncle and my mother because they were always up to games and tricks and erm what have you pause dur short but i went to a little school i remember it was quite a hilly area and i went to the trunc s trunc taken to the local children you know where the children went to school in the young classes pause dur short and one of the things we did pause dur short erm was to be taught knitting pause dur short er i was not pause dur short terribly keen on this class because although i could i was taught to knit i kept dropping stitches and getting into awful trouble because pause dur short oh dear pause dur short i d lost a stitch again vocal desc laugh and bringing it home and erm mother and aunt sorting me out with the knitting and back i would go and the school had a long corridor where we had to leave our little coats pause dur short and there were cubbyholes erm pause dur short opposite your classroom pause dur short where you hung your coats erm and put your wellington boots and things like that and then you went into your classroom opposite pause dur short but the trouble was all these little pause dur short cubbyhole places all looked the same to me i couldn t quite make out where my coat should go which classroom i should go into and i think after about six months of coping with all this erm i said to my mum mummy can we please please go home again i don t like this school to which erm i m going so erm after a probably about another month six weeks we all trooped back again to erm to the home where erm grandmother still was and where the lodgers were and erm life continued on erm much until the end of the war so that s some of my memories of early childhood i suppose erm
1	was
1	that stand so vividly in my mind
1	was there er trunc u trunc trunc a trunc any of the lodgers that you found interesting or quirky or were were there anybody was there anybody there who stood out
1	erm yes i would say perhaps there were two that stood out erm one was a lady called anon nametype f type name pause dur short erm she was and we kept friendly with her and one of the pause dur short the gentlemen that came as well erm again over the years we kept in touch with pause dur short and i think those two stand out really as
1	mm
1	being really nice people hard working and would help in the home as well as going out to work erm pause dur short so they were really lovely others seemed to pass by in a bit of a a daze for me really pause dur short er one thing i do remember with anon nametype f type name when i was a very well i was just a very little girl erm pause dur short mother made me do something that i really hated doing vocal desc laugh erm whether it was i don t think my brother did no he definitely didn t but i i had to do it erm she wanted the lodger anon nametype f type name to see that i was all alright and there was nothing wrong with me erm pause dur short and one day when i was due for my bath pause dur short she made me come down just and trunc s trunc show her me with trunc n trunc just my skin with nothing else on me vocal desc laugh at erm before i sort of round the towel round again to see that i was all you know clean and nice erm pause dur short and i always remember hating trunc th trunc absolutely hating that erm pause dur short but she was such a nice lady you know she trunc pro trunc they probably had a laugh erm
1	unclear can unclear pause dur short mm
1	another little memory i have of childhood is vocal desc cough erm pause dur short when i was a little bit older i suppose i was pause dur short perhaps eight or nine yes that was probably about the age i was i was very poorly for about three months and erm initially they thought i had mumps erm in fact the nurse came round and said that s what i d got pause dur short but pause dur short i didn t get better pause dur short at the end of what they thought the mumps spell should be my face was getting fatter and i was in a lot of pain and i seemed to be losing weight and it obviously wasn t mumps and i think it was my cervical glands had become terribly swollen pause dur short erm pause dur short i had a little bed down in the sitting room and i remember on one occasion erm because we had open fires coal fires we had erm the chimney sweep came pause dur short and i pause dur short begged mother i wanted to see the chimney sweep so erm pause dur short amidst all the room being covered up with cloths and all around the fireplace erm protected with things pause dur short and the sweep coming erm i was allowed to lie on my little bed with a sweep in the room vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and and see vocal desc laugh the brush trunc u trunc the brush going up and all the rods going up and obviously there was oh dear me erm pause dur short you know it wasn t a very clean process at the end but anyway erm i was given this special permission to see the sweep which was very kind pause dur short and erm i think in the end they probably thought my glands possibly had been tb and i was poorly probably from about pause dur short oh i don t know four four five months erm i was off school pause dur short and erm pause dur short i remember that christmas you know we didn t have a lot of toys or anything like that i mean you just couldn t buy them we were all on ration books and one of the things you know we had was a toyshop mummy said erm was there something i would really like for christmas i could just have one thing pause dur short and said oh mummy i would really like a dolly erm is it possible with the coupon to get a dolly so she said we ll i ll erm pause dur short when i m down i ll call in the toyshop and we ll see if we can get one for you pause dur short well she came home but erm no pause dur short there were no they there were not enough erm in the ration book to get a dolly and they erm we couldn t manage one but if i would like there was one thing they could manage for me with what we d got and that was i don t know we probably wouldn t be allowed to say the word now but it was a gollywog and it had a little black face with erm nice smiling red lips and sort of fluffy black hair erm so i said oh yes please that would that would be lovely so for that christmas erm pause dur short i had a gollywog which was my pride and joy and my love for many many years and erm pause dur short it was just super it did the trick it was not a dolly but it was just lovely and i was so much appreciated it so that s another little memory pause dur short erm and while i was so poorly i was not erm pause dur short you know i had special food and drinks and that sort of thing and i know i was on tablets called pause dur short m and b tablets erm which were i suppose the ones they could only ones they could give me for antibiotics pause dur short and i m afraid to say that erm i was a little bit naughty on occasions vocal desc laugh i didn t want to take this medicine pause dur short erm pause dur short i shouldn t ve played up but erm i think i did and erm i know when mother had a trunc n trunc one of the neighbours round and they were trying to persuade me to get down this horrible stuff which erm mum used to crush erm i suppose it was tablets which had to be crushed down she crushed them down to like a little powder and to try and get me to take it erm pause dur short they had we had one pot of jam erm per month pause dur short erm pause dur short and so i was given a teaspoon of jam to eat with pause dur short all this crushed white powder in it er it was erm vocal desc laugh it was not nice at all but erm pause dur short somehow it got it it was put down me anyway whether i liked it or i didn t like it i it had to be done erm so erm i had it and pause dur short we had nice things like gruel i remember
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm pause dur short and in the war pause dur short you know butter erm was very very scarce we had erm sort of i think one half a pound a month erm and then we had the block margarine pause dur short and my grandmother you know to make things go round would erm spread one slice thinly with butter and then one slice thinly with margarine and it would be cut up pause dur short well my crafty brother two years older than me pause dur short erm if he could get his hands on the bread first he would see that he got the bread with the butter on
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and vocal desc laugh i and i was left with the one with the trunc m trunc erm the margarine erm so that s another little memory erm and i remember my brother and i pause dur short you know for playing games erm pause dur short we had a large table in our dining room and we had erm pause dur short could have a long cloth over it erm might ve been a sheet mother provided i can t quite remember but anyway it went down to the floor so brother and i used to have this like a little house inside and we used to play could we go and play games in the house and mother would get it all erm organised for us and that was great fun pause dur short erm pause dur short i can remember on one occasion when probably we d been playing up pause dur short erm pause dur short and it was very very rare but i can remember my mother chasing us around the vocal desc laugh chasing us around the house we d been naughty about something but i can t quite remember what but erm pause dur short that sort of sticks out in my memory pause dur short so that s my young childhood memories i think erm of young childhood yeah
1	well thank you very much they re very trunc interest trunc you obviously had a very nice childhood didn t you erm and er trunc i trunc er you know erm wonderful would that be called an anderson shelter the one you were in
1	i think it did
1	yes it may have been an anderson trunc she trunc that s the only shelter i know the name of basically
1	yes i think pause dur short yes pause dur short yes i think it was
1	yeah pause dur short and
1	yes
1	and if you could see your lodger anon nametype f type name now how would
1	yes
1	you describe her if you could if she walked into the room today
1	yes
1	what would you how would you describe her
1	well obviously i would describe her as i last knew her pause dur short erm pause dur short i would say medium height sort of light brown hair erm blueish eyes pause dur short erm pause dur short and a lovely smile pause dur short and always sort of a very erm pause dur short happy demeanour in the house and very kind and helpful
1	and do you know what sort of job she did at those in those days or were you too young to know that
1	no i did know erm pause dur short because where erm pause dur short we lived was not too far i suppose from anon type place er the factories that erm were in the nearby town pause dur short were changed for wartime work and some of them built erm pause dur short well i don t know whether it was erm pause dur short bomb making things but things that the germans erm would want to pause dur short bomb if they could to stop
1	right
1	the production
1	right
1	so she was in what we would call today i suppose war work
1	right
1	it wasn t her normal job but erm pause dur short everybody had to if they could had to come on for war work
1	right right and do you think erm your brother for instance who had that rather nasty erm illness earlier on
1	mm
1	do you think it weakened him for the rest of his life or pause dur short do you think that was it that was just a period he got over it and he got better
1	well as a child pause dur short i would say i was the sturdy one
1	right
1	erm pause dur short strong pause dur short my brother was more what i would ve thought was a bit sort of a trunc f trunc erm more of a weakling really erm pause dur short and he was very fussy about what he ate erm pause dur short i will say erm he was brought up on bread and marmalade sandwiches because
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	that s the only thing i remember him vocal desc laugh erm seeing him erm erm eat it probably wasn t because erm you know grandmother and mother were very good cooks particularly for the main meal of the day and erm i mean in those days they were not given all these choices but you were good given good meals erm and everybody had to eat them
1	yes
1	erm and that was it er but in his adult life pause dur short erm i would say he became pause dur short the really strong one and sturdy one erm and had really no ill health for the rest of his life
1	cor that s marvellous isn t it
1	where erm mm where i was more erm pause dur short well trunc n trunc not so strong as he was
1	no
1	no
1	er it s funny because anon nametype m type name i m sure anon nametype m type name lived on er marmalade sandwiches when he was younger for a long time and he and he also strangely enough wore a duffle coat all the time so really maybe he
1	mm
1	was a pause dur short a sort of paddington bear really
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	because marmalade sandwiches
1	yes
1	are really the food of paddington bear aren t they so
1	absolutely under his hat he always carried them didn t he
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm pause dur short and last time i was up at paddington railway station with my brother pause dur short erm we sat very close to the lovely statue which they ve got
1	oh yes
1	of paddington bear pause dur short erm on sort of the erm
1	concourse up there
1	it s yes the concourse of the erm of the station
1	and brunel s there as well now isn t he
1	that s pause dur short yes
1	yes pause dur short mm
1	yes pause dur short so erm pause dur short yes that s a memory too
1	it is and trunc s trunc
1	and course when i travelled on the train as erm youngsters it was the steam trains and one remembered you know they had a special sound really the steam trains erm pause dur short different to what the diesel and the electric ones
1	definitely
1	have today and if the windows were open then we got you know quite a lot of black erm specks used to come in through the carriage windows and
1	yeah
1	quite smutty really erm pause dur short it s much cleaner travel today er
1	you were always told not to look out of the window weren t you pause dur short never look trunc ou trunc never put your head out through the window
1	oh yes yes
1	always trunc b trunc because of smuts unclear in the aisle unclear also other passing trains but not to put your head out through the window
1	yes pause dur short yes
1	er whereas today you don t really hear that being said do you really you don t nobody seems to say it
1	no pause dur short no
1	it s common sense i suppose not to do it pause dur short erm so erm pause dur short i remember going on a train to erm pause dur short down to the coast when we went over when i was seven we went over erm and we went on a steam train down to the coast down to dover and we went on a a ship going over to erm to france erm with all trunc na trunc with all our army erm pause dur short army people and their wives basically and i remember being crammed into this really small cabin with my mother pause dur short there and i remember the steward bringing her a cup of tea in the morning and it was stone cold erm pause dur short which was quite trunc f trunc well it wasn t funny for her but erm i remember she didn t like it erm what was the food that you had when you were a child what would you say your favourite meal was pause dur short during those war years i mean trunc d trunc apple crumble would that have been available i mean obviously in season apples
1	i can t really remember pause dur short apple crumble when i was erm pause dur short a child pause dur short although having said that i ve had a lovely piece today which was very very nice erm
1	vocal desc laugh oh
1	vocal desc laugh but that s quite beside the point isn t it
1	yeah
1	erm erm pause dur short i can remember we had erm we didn t have eggs very much erm we had erm dried egg powder in erm war years erm pause dur short er pause dur short we didn t have a fridge of course so erm most of erm pause dur short you know sort of meat was bought on a very regular basis from the butcher and erm pause dur short grandmother used to make nice home made bread i remember pause dur short erm pause dur short vegetables we grew in the garden trunc i trunc where we could and erm my father had a little orchard and erm
1	mm
1	we had apple trees and plum trees erm pause dur short and we pause dur short he had a an area for raspberries and gooseberries and redcurrants all that sort of thing erm pause dur short and we used to make a lot of jam erm pause dur short which was erm pause dur short very nice
1	ah
1	so erm yes just fresh wholesome food i think really
1	mm pause dur short people were
1	particularly after the war you know when the rations were lifted a bit
1	yeah
1	erm
1	people were much fitter during the war they re saying that now because of the rationing not so much fat not so much sugar
1	yes pause dur short yes pause dur short that s right
1	erm and therefore pause dur short not so many erm health problems
1	no
1	heart problems diabetes didn t unclear happen unclear much then
1	no
1	no obesity really
1	no i can t remember any obese people at all as a child pause dur short erm that would ve been erm a real rarity pause dur short there s one thing though i think has improved pause dur short erm pause dur short is pause dur short you know with we used to have perhaps a penny of pause dur short pocket money pause dur short and we used to trunc g trunc like to go down to the sweetie shop i remember there was a sweets were rationed but as long as you saved up your ration erm pause dur short and teeth really suffered because that seemed to be the thing one liked to spend one s pocket money on and and of course we didn t have any fluoride in the water or in the toothpaste or anything like that so erm pause dur short our teeth didn t keep near as well as erm
1	no
1	children do children s teeth do today
1	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short erm well we i remember when i went to school we had penny chews and things like that and it was you know pause dur short they re absolutely awful for your teeth erm you know pause dur short but we had them erm pause dur short but then we didn t get much pocket money so we we
1	no
1	vocal desc laugh we didn t get them very often so shall we end it there do you think
1	thank you very much
1	thank you very much that s great so we didn t thirty three minutes thirteen seconds
1	right oh
1	that s not too bad then anon nametype f type name
1	no no
1	that s not too bad then is it dear
1	no no stop recording
0	yeah
0	just to explore what it was to to get obsessed pause dur short and eh i d recently bought minecraft so i decided i d go for that and just learn absolutely everything about it pause dur short and em eh something that came across when i was looking at bits and bobs is that a lot of people on minecraft servers are in their own little worlds they tend to make these monuments to mario pause dur short it s a it s a very easy statue to make pause dur short there s there s pixel art of mario and it trunc ha trunc happens all the time pause dur short so i had sort of combined those ideas in my head and thought it would be a bit of fun to make a sort of combination of a garden gnome the statue of liberty and super mario
0	yeah mods
0	yeah he he was a mod so
0	so he he was basically in creative so he could give me all the resources that i needed pause dur short em so i ve sort of got maybe about half way through it and em and someone asked me why is it a gnome why isn t it just mario and i was sort of like eh this is it s supposed to be a sort of artistic statement about cyber provincialism pause dur short and he said why can t it just be fun i was like mm pause dur short well it is still kind of fun but it kind of shoved it down a bit for me pause dur short so i left it for ages and then
0	oh i see no you re right okay
0	mm
0	love it
0	yeah
0	it s kind of like a virtual communist state
0	yeah yeah it really was pause dur short so em i found the most obvious place on the map after the last one had been diluted because eh version one point o came out pause dur short em so i went to the coordinate zero zero pause dur short and started building this town pause dur short and there s this eh there s this one guy on the server that was a bit too keen pause dur short just spent hours and hours and hours playing on it pause dur short and i just sort of set up the basics and he made it look beautiful pause dur short we had a communal mine as well which which was really nice pause dur short and em to to keep the animals as well pause dur short eh just wanted sort of little fence pens but this guy made a huge huge great barn
0	oh no
0	and it caused him to just just go completely the other direction as well pause dur short he just completely just lost it pause dur short em so when i explained this to my class they were really sort of intrigued by this idea pause dur short and em and then in the write up i explained that em my my original idea about em eh eh cyber provincialism which was the concept that sort of started the whole building in minecraft em project pause dur short em at first it was like em pause dur short when i first heard about it i was think maybe em the idea is that these people in their game worlds had sort of closed off from the real world pause dur short but that wasn t so much the case because there were things that enter into the minecraft universe that are factors in the real world pause dur short like there was em occupy wall street and occupy london and stuff like that
0	and the group who were televising it were recording everything and stuff em were wearing occupy minecraft t shirts pause dur short and there was a lot of discussion apparently according to one of these journalists who covered it pause dur short em there was a lot of discussion about how they can bring the occupy movement into minecraft and sort of enthuse everyone because it s quite quite a connected community the minecraft community with the creative projects that go on pause dur short and em when steve jobs passed away the someone put em built a massive eh sign in the main eh the village on one of the maps r i p steve jobs and sort of did a ipod thing and and drew made a ipod out of blocks pause dur short and em so so news does have a way of getting in so pause dur short that that that s one part of cyber provincialism that em that one way of looking at it that that i considered pause dur short em another was eh bringing various communities eh no the getting a community to to look at different cultures
0	oh excellent
0	so he had to destroy it
1	you don t know if it s pause dur short done erm anyway you might have already can i have some yoghurt please
1	yes help yourself
1	er pause dur short did you see that other yoghurt is there so you just need to check dates
1	yes i trunc d trunc i did check the dates yes pause dur short no i saw that was opened anyway so
1	that fruit actually lasted pretty well but i just had to throw away one peach i think yeah or one or might might have been one nectarine that had gone
1	mm
1	horribly mouldy and one pear i think that had gone funny
1	oh this is quite sour
1	mm pause dur short it s tart
1	mm

1	yeah cos we didn t walk that oh i know that white place is trunc act trunc actually a hotel pause dur short and i think maybe the pink place pause dur short is to the left of the picture where it is sort of pinky pause dur long it s all depressing i don t i don t know what people saw in anon type place pause dur short apart from those mountains that looked they looked quite nice from that island what was it called
1	yes erm well we went past on the boat they looked very dramatic didn t they
1	yeah it looked they looked better from er from those other islands was it mm anon type place
1	erm pause dur short er i can t remember is this erm anon type place and anon type place wasn t it
1	yeah but we didn t go there we went to the other one
1	no we went we sailed past them
1	yes and we went
1	and then anon type place was on the
1	but as we were
1	the right hand side
1	yes exactly and and so you could see the mountains but then
1	mm
1	when you actually got to anon type place you couldn t see anything
1	no pause dur short not where we went pause dur long you know it s a bit of a funny shaped island wasn t it it was like
1	there was a play on the radio actually set on erm raasay i think it s called
1	mm
1	that that long thin island
1	raasay yes yes
1	about somebody who d built a road pause dur short by himself
1	yes
1	on what do you know about that
1	yes erm pause dur short i think you mentioned them pause dur short about this building this road all the way around the island or something
1	i don t know about all the way around it was pause dur short probably to the to the ferry port pause dur long
1	where from
1	i don t know from where they lived i suppose pause dur long
1	i don t think there s much on it anyway
1	no it s probably like that one pause dur short we went on last of all opposite pause dur short oban
1	mm
1	that was a bit of a waste of time
1	oh yes yes pause dur long
1	i wonder if they will pause dur short i don t suppose they ll take the initiative and vote for independence pause dur long
1	who would
1	scots
1	well
1	i looked at the map and it is much smaller than norway but maybe the population is roughly the same size
1	mm i think it is about the same isn t it it s about
1	which
1	is it four million or something
1	well probably
1	very small
1	vocal desc sigh i don t see what that s got to do with it i don t pause dur long i i don t think they ll do anything that s interesting i suppose anyway pause dur long
1	i can t see them voting yes
1	why not pause dur long
1	well i can t really see any any pause dur short strong argument
1	well i can t see any strong argument for not voting yes quite honestly apart from negative ones pause dur short i was surprised by that bloke on the boat do you remember did you talk to him
1	no you spoke to him though
1	i thought his er reasoning was very childlike childish too actually
1	mm
1	did you erm did you feel pause dur short vindicated or did you feel embarrassed that we didn t get in the car pause dur long
1	oh erm er that chap from st andrews
1	yes
1	no because i i wasn t erm party to that conversation was i
1	yeah but were you happy that were you still happy when we saw him again in portree that we hadn t accepted the lift or did you feel guilt
1	no i didn t feel any guilt no i well i mean why should why should i feel guilty i mean yes he he he offered to give us a lift erm but we have every right to say yes or no
1	vocal desc sigh i keep on
1	and and and pause dur short we were quite happy just taking the bus so
1	i keep remembering a bloke in munich trunc off trunc offering me a lift to vienna pause dur short when i was pause dur short mm on a trip pause dur short from my from anon type place actually
1	mm
1	and i think that s looking back i think that s highly suspicious
1	yeah i think when you re by yourself you ve got to be more wary
1	exactly but he seemed all very very pleasant at the time i happened to say i was going vienna next erm pause dur short and erm and then and then he said er he was going there on sunday and he d give me a lift
1	mm
1	it was quite tempting cos i think i don t know how i knew but i think he seemed to have quite a nice car pause dur short anyway the i think the main reason why i didn t was because i had an aeroplane ticket and i trunc w trunc i fancied pause dur short going by plane
1	mm pause dur long
1	yeah it was trunc qui trunc quite horrible thinking back thinking like what would have what might have happened if i had accepted
1	mm and and the other thing is when when you re travelling in in someone s car you feel obliged to make conversation all the time which can be quite tiring and trunc pr trunc probably impossible for me with my hearing pause dur long cos i can t hear very well in cars as you know
1	well he trunc ju trunc he just didn t seem a terribly social person to me so i couldn t imagine how he would enjoy it
1	no pause dur long mm good point
1	i mean it s a funny thing to do as well to go pause dur short for your holidays on
1	yes he was he was just kind of
1	drifting
1	drifting yeah taking it as it comes like pause dur long it was very strange
1	but what do you think about that other bloke that artist that furniture person pause dur short was that drifting
1	mm pause dur short i can t remember his
1	the trunc onl trunc
1	background but why
1	the trunc ans trunc yes
1	he he was doing something that he d done several times before
1	plus he d hired a cottage or he d pause dur short been lent a cottage or something near mallaig
1	oh i can t remember that
1	outside mallaig he had a car he had a car as well i think pause dur short and there were other people that were gonna join him so it a bit of a different kettle of fish i think it was family or people were coming up pause dur long did i tell you that i i wrote and erm reviewed his website and he wrote and thanked me
1	no you didn t
1	ah a cursory acknowledgement and erm that was a but trunc d trunc you i don t i m not surprised because probably people don t like to be given feedback on their websites
1	mm
1	cos you it s odds on it s quite likely you d say the wrong thing pause dur long
1	so did you did you so you you emailed him
1	yeah i told him
1	mm
1	he needs some i think i probably said what what i pause dur short said on the boat i think i i said you he needed some text i mean pause dur short all that i could see unless he d sent me not the correct links were pictures pause dur short i think he called it a blog i trunc th trunc or i wouldn t i didn t see how it was a blog
1	mm
1	i probably said all the same things that i said on the boat that pause dur short he needed to offer some tips and tell people something like how he chose his raw materials or how he approached pause dur short a project just to give people an insight into trunc wh trunc what
1	mm
1	he did
1	yes pause dur long and how long ago was was it when you sent him that email
1	oh i don t know probably when we got back
1	oh
1	the nineteenth of june
1	well maybe he s changed it
1	vocal desc sigh i couldn t well i haven t got time to pause dur short don t even know where the car or anything where pause dur short not interested
1	mm
1	you can go you can check if you want
1	well if if you can give give me the website and i can have a look
1	are you really interested
1	no well pause dur short sort of
1	you wouldn t know it if
1	but but i wouldn t know what s erm what it looked like before
1	no pause dur short oh well yeah but you would know if there was any text there
1	yes
1	anyway i trunc wou trunc i d be very surprised cos i i don t think he s the kind of person that takes advice from people pause dur long
1	mm pause dur long
1	i think pause dur short i think anon nametype m type name would and that prom that i heard on the radio the other night pause dur short i think he must but yeah i think maybe he went for richard strauss cos i turned it on when i was eating it must have been the weekend and i cos i caught the end of er like elgar s second symphony but it was conducted by some russian and pause dur short i did think it was a very strange interpretation i thought
1	oh pause dur long i don t know the second symphony i don t know much elgar at all
1	trunc y trunc you you would trunc recogni trunc well you d trunc l trunc i thought the dream of gerontius was your favourite piece
1	yeah yeah that s about the only
1	vocal desc sigh
1	elgar i know well apart from the really popular
1	well i think you d recognise
1	pomp and circumstance
1	well i think you d pause dur short he said that he heard that er played in a church in sicily when he and anon nametype f type name were there on holiday
1	what dream of gerontius
1	er
1	which one
1	pomp and circumstance
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	he thought it was for a wedding he thought it was very inappropriate
1	mm pause dur long
1	do you think he meant the land of hope and glory bit do you is that what he means do you think
1	i don t know there are several of them aren t there
1	well i don t know
1	so it depends
1	i think that colours your thing cos he dismissed the second symphony and i said it s actually quite poignant because it s a sort of farewell to empire pause dur short cos it s all very well saying er trunc yea trunc it it might pay lip service pause dur short to those times that but i think the trunc v trunc the very spooky ending pause dur short i think is an an acknowledgement that it s all over
1	mm
1	you well you d you trunc wou trunc you would recognise it i m sure you d know what pause dur long
1	mm i think
1	it s a hardly it s hardly a triumphant ending quite the opposite
1	mm pause dur long yeah i ll have to listen to it at some time it s probably on youtube
1	everything is on youtube i don t see how they can be on youtube actually must be illegal on phones pause dur short in people s pockets
1	yes well all that copyright business seems to have just gone by the wayside pause dur long
1	well i m sure that i m sure if people wanted to they could they could get in touch with youtube and get these things taken off couldn t they
1	mm i don t know pause dur long
1	i m i m sure you i m sure you can
1	mm pause dur short i don t know it it s pause dur short how how it how it works whether it s just when one person that pause dur short has to request it to be removed or
1	no well it it would be whoever is the copyright holder if it s a piece of art pause dur short in the case of a concert i don t know maybe it s the concert organiser the promoter
1	mm pause dur long
1	but that that could include the copyright holder i mean supposing elgar s got family do they trunc b trunc er trunc i trunc is elgar out of copyright it s seventy years i suppose he would be pause dur short does that mean that people can just print the music pause dur long copyright doesn t last it s finite you know
1	mm pause dur long well the copyright is
1	i think it s different in
1	acquired by the publisher isn t it
1	what you mean normally
1	and and it s trunc n trunc probably fifty years or something like that is it
1	are you sure it s acquired by the publisher because i thought it was the author pause dur long look here s a book pause dur long
1	i always thought it was the trunc publish trunc
1	copyright stephen pinker so it s
1	oh
1	so it s the author and it says pause dur short nineteen ninety four anyway i think it s probably life plus some years
1	mm
1	but then i m sure things pass to your heirs
1	mm i don t know no idea
1	and also it s different in the usa i think actually it s shorter pause dur short there
1	oh is it
1	i think so pause dur short i ve got the word i ve got the figure seventy seventy years in my mind for the uk pause dur short but i don t know if that s music or everything pause dur long must read all this stuff
1	mm
1	vocal desc sigh and it would be a good thing as well like if tidy up all these all these pause dur short books off the table
1	yes
1	did you see about those seagulls in rome by the way attacking er when the pope
1	no
1	you must have read it it s on the bbc there s a thing on the bbc page
1	oh that ll be on youtube
1	well it might be but they they released two doves and a seagull attacked one of the doves and what i didn t realise was they eat them
1	oh gosh
1	so they re beyond the pale as far as i m concerned now they hit the the seagull got the dove but by er tail feathers and so the dove escaped minus a few feathers pause dur short but then the second pause dur short dove was killed by a crow
1	oh gosh
1	imagine the symbolism of that i mean how and it s very embarrassing as well imagine you re the pope pause dur short and you re and you re there presumably on the balcony or whatever it was and this thing happens in front of what are you supposed to do
1	mm you d think they d have people to take care of that sort of thing and make sure there are no birds around
1	how can they
1	well
1	but yeah apparently that s
1	scare them off or something
1	that s a point of this report by a journalist bbc journalist whatever or a correspondent that it rome has been overrun with these wretched what are they called mackerel gulls herring gulls
1	herring gulls yes yes
1	which are which are what these are
1	these are yes
1	they re horrid vicious things and you can tell about the way they re screaming and they re unclear they ve got slightly better but they re still ridiculous
1	mm
1	and anyway so i ve got no trunc i trunc just fed up with them now that i know that they kill other birds like that pause dur long i mean some other birds i know they don t they they just ignore them cos i ve seen them i ve seen jackdaws or crows and they just ignore the seagulls i mean
1	well trunc th trunc i ve i ve heard that trunc s trunc seagulls don t like crows and they will stay away so if the if the the crows are nesting they will keep their distance
1	not much though cos the on campus there s a there s a rookery and
1	really
1	they ve both flying there
1	mm yes well they i d i trunc th trunc i think what s happened is that that cos there used to be a rookery up i the anon type place for years
1	has it gone
1	yes
1	why
1	i don t know they probably just moved on and i think it s since they ve gone that we ve got the seagulls
1	but it isn t yeah but the it isn t just in the close that they re nesting they re nesting
1	yeah they re probably nesting in the vicinity or they were
1	well it s a very large vicinity because on parallel streets they they are around and i doubt whether our little tiny rookery was influencing a couple of roads away or a couple of streets away er have you trunc deci trunc have you thought about the implications if they try to nest on the roof
1	mm
1	you have those flat bits
1	yes yes well i mean lots of people they end up putting barbed wire or mesh up don t they to to keep them off their chimney stacks and pause dur short stuff like that they like to nest pause dur short between chimney stacks
1	i don t cos er cos when i run past that house by the path into the park at the sort of bottom of anon type place avenue i think pause dur short why has that household holder allowed cos they they must be able to nest up there cos they re always guarding they re always perching up on those roofs have you seen have you seen them
1	yeah trunc wh trunc which house is it
1	oh it one it it s it s near the path into the park
1	right
1	er it
1	it right next to the path
1	it s before the turn in the road goes
1	oh right
1	haven t you noticed them
1	no no pause dur long
1	anyway pause dur short i don t know how that householder house owner tolerated them there
1	mm pause dur short yeah i don t know
1	but it isn t just me cos i ve had trunc conversa trunc i ve had a conversation with one person that obviously lives in the next street or lives around there about them oh that was about another lot that were that were there nesting in a different street but i ve seen people who look up anyway trunc a trunc about the ones that we re talking about pause dur short so i think it s a lot of trunc pea trunc and er pause dur short rubbish is one thing but vocal desc sigh cos they re pecking into plastic bags aren t they
1	mm oh they will do yes pause dur short they create a lot of litter as well
1	well that s certainly
1	a lot
1	i ve that s what s happening on the campus i m sure that they are pause dur short there s loads of junk junk food and pause dur long i think they can make a concerted effort to get rid of them maybe put some pause dur short poison down or something
1	i think they have to do it more humanely that that pause dur short well it the best thing is to er break their eggs isn t it
1	well pause dur short that s i suppose what happened that year that that ridiculous seagull built the nest on the flight of steps
1	mm
1	and they were the flight of steps were cordoned off but eventually the nest trunc disa trunc i trunc ima trunc trunc ima trunc they disappeared and i imagine it was a fox or some other rodent pause dur short because it was just on the ground so
1	mm
1	what other what other apart from foxes well it could be any wildlife in that area pause dur short is it stoats and weasels
1	mm i dunno
1	they all maybe they all go for eggs
1	yeah
1	but it s er something s got to be done because as one of my colleagues said pause dur short you are encouraged to shoot rabbits it s your duty well we all know that pause dur short but the seagulls are protected pause dur short
1	mm
1	well pause dur short that doesn t seem to make sense i m not saying it s the seagulls fault it s obviously cos human beings have been
1	well it s it s the human
1	messing
1	i think it s a human
1	yeah because
1	that we caused it
1	yeah probably by taking too much fish out of too many fish out of the sea so they ve got nothing to live on where they should be living on them and so they ve moved
1	yeah and and we we leave too much too much food out rubbish and they scavenge
1	but that doesn t give them an excuse to start pecking and killing other birds
1	well that s just their nature pause dur short that s that s trunc prob trunc they ve probably always been like that pause dur short but they are very vicious pause dur long
1	reptilian pause dur long yeah i wouldn t be surprised if they re around after human beings have gone
1	mm pause dur long and maybe they could be quite adaptable pause dur short as a species
1	vocal desc sigh maybe their stupidity is less stupid that human beings stupidity pause dur short in a way
1	mm
0	when we re old people like
0	i thought you meant like literally white clothes
0	yeah white clothes vocal desc laugh
0	worldwide
0	with my hand
0	oh that s like er what the red thing
0	mm
0	oh dear yeah maybe go maybe go go and
0	it does a bit
0	oh no
0	doesn t it
0	oh right
0	oh fuck you
0	it always does that
0	seven percent vocal desc laugh is unclear downloaded unclear
0	seven percent
0	i m so dumb
0	hang on we re on trunc twenty trunc
0	yeah i ve seen them like do you mean the ones outside
0	yeah
0	really i thought they were free
0	oh are they
0	i unclear to go in them and they just said yeah
0	oh okay
0	i thought
0	vocal desc laugh
0	there s ones they re unclear shut off unclear they re little rooms inside the library
0	or if it s too busy
0	unclear
0	and that s open later as well which is really annoying like why is the library
0	shut
0	i thought it was i ve heard on yik yak people are on it at like two in the morning on
0	oh oh okay oh that s good then yeah cos someone said that it was just the learning zone that was open late but maybe it s changed now or something hopefully pause dur long
0	oh you ve got monet as your background
0	must be the monet
0	yeah i don t know what it is i think maybe like from my perspective cos i ve drawn it and i ve like done i remember like the process of it that i can t really appreciate it as pause dur short as just a drawing like other people can so i can never
0	cos i guess that i m gonna see it as a finished piece you re gonna see it as like
0	like do you ever feel trunc s trunc completely satisfied
0	i know it is quite isn t it
0	i always wondered if people that are really good at art or really good at real drawings like you see like cartoons as like really shit or do you just see it as different
0	observation s harder cos you can t make up shit if it s not there
0	you know
0	but you have to kind of and
0	ignore it
0	that s cheating in my opinion vocal desc laugh some people might say well
0	in some ways yeah
0	yeah definitely
0	yeah like i don t feel like any of my art s creative i just feel like i m looking at something and drawing it the way i would the way my hand
0	it s not it s it is a skill
0	mm
0	it s definitely a skill
0	you should have seen some of the people in my a level class it was just ridiculous
0	amazing
0	well my friend especially well my old friend like we kind of fell out a bit but she she draws like insanely realistic faces i ll show you pause dur short erm she doesn t really do them anymore but she used to pause dur short and me and her were always kind of like competing in in our art class vocal desc laugh to make better stuff

0	i was like did she draw that no

0	yep
0	ah pause dur short jesus pause dur short i thought that car s long
0	nice
0	i ve never seen a hummer range rover before
0	it was like a weird perspective thing
0	yes pause dur long to be fair what i d like to be doing now is in an open topped car through scotland rather than unclear of the m
0	that s pretty cool pause dur short just cruising yeah pause dur short we d all have to tap our fingers and nod our heads on the side of the car
0	some beers pause dur short vocal desc laugh i ll put music on pause dur short some beers i can offer you pause dur short shall we book then
0	yeah just trunc tu trunc you just roll it over pause dur short you would never use it
0	yeah yeah exactly pause dur short i mean that kind of thing would be fun and i mean it s always i wouldn t mind just having a you know random day off pause dur short go to london or something pause dur short we could go to a matinee or you know pause dur short erm but yeah or all the time pause dur short i mean don t just use it in dribs and drabs
0	yeah pause dur short i mean i think i could probably say that quite short notice at work pause dur short erm i don t have anything that week i don t think so
0	i ll do it from the car
0	pardon
0	lies in
0	that will be nice
0	unclear
0	yeah and erm just yeah
0	no that sounds a great plan
0	yeah i ll mention that to them
0	yeah it s a shame but never mind pause dur short they might change that i mean pause dur short or we could make a case to them pause dur short we could write to them and say
0	you know pause dur short no harm in doing that
0	yeah pause dur short true
0	good pause dur short he seems to be quite into it
0	yeah i was going what s the wall angel pause dur short and then you carried on talking and i was like what s the wall angel
0	unclear yeah
0	what last night he was enjoying himself pause dur short he was plastered
0	but we i can t believe
0	so bad
0	huh pause dur short oh your poor mother
0	i think retirement suits him
0	yeah
0	i m going to so there
0	possibly but he still doesn t want to get into a car
0	mm pause dur short no but then that but that wouldn t work because so when you re packing boxes like that s what s immediately happening pause dur short that s what s happening the next day
0	i think we have a very common attitude to children like some babies i find actually that s quite cute pause dur short most of them are like yeah you re just a bit smelly aren t you
0	my dog s far more hygienic than a baby
0	it depends on the dog but then if you have sort of
0	trunc s trunc pause dur short vocal desc laugh so useful
0	he s very good at picking up on that
0	well he can also sniff out drugs a lot more effectively than you can
0	yes pause dur short yeah he knows what to do unclear event desc sound of music huh pause dur short nice pause dur short vocal desc yawn excuse me
0	oh yes about just about dad and enjoying last night
0	dessert was the best bit
0	i mean that was my only comment pause dur short it was fine pause dur short the main course again
0	erm i ve never had anything quite like that pause dur short it was really really well put together so
0	yeah
0	cos the alternative is to go back by the m but i think that will be slower
0	i said go to the cinema
0	yeah
0	right erm
0	i m not i m not sure what s out at the minute
0	and erm they used the music from the artist for one of the tasks and it just really annoyed me pause dur short such wonderful music from such an amazing film and they ve got it accompanying the
0	the apprentice pause dur short it s really bad yeah pause dur short but you see why i like it it s really bad pause dur short i mean it s embarrassing for them like pause dur short but they re meant to be trunc s trunc you know i am the best at business pause dur short and they re saying things and you just think oh my goodness to me pause dur short do you are you really this bad like genuinely
0	erm and make a trunc pro trunc pause dur short they they trunc p trunc team that makes the most profit wins pause dur short simple as that
0	probably quite effective
0	that s a very small door
0	how bizarre pause dur short it s kind of weird only having one bike pause dur short you d think
0	mm
0	left hand drive
0	ah
0	ha pause dur long
0	not as good as masterchef pause dur short because masterchef they don t bother with sort of pause dur short it s not really about the personalities so much pause dur short it s about cooking and they do just cook for a long time pause dur short in trunc dif trunc in different situations but they fundamentally spend an hour showing you their cooking pause dur short which is quite nice you know pause dur short it s interesting pause dur short whereas the apprentice just shows it s an hour of them running around like headless chickens being pathetic
0	hit list yeah
0	yeah pause dur long
0	they obviously think unclear you know pause dur short whenever pause dur short it s ages since i ve flown
0	ah bless pause dur short yeah the last time i flew was i think i went to dublin in first year pause dur short yeah that would have been the last time
0	like it shows you ve thought about it pause dur short so are you going to talk about
0	yeah
0	and i really enjoyed that and i haven t done that since
0	and i ve had less of that which has been de motivating
0	okay so so you d really yeah i mean you could say you d really like to spend more time in client meetings and meetings and things pause dur short and yeah that you d like more of a project pause dur short yeah more more having a project to work on yeah pause dur short erm definitely worth bringing up and i think i mean i guess everyone wants to travel for work so
0	true pause dur short well i guess you get sick of it
0	yeah yeah
0	well yeah maybe worth mentioning then that you like travelling and pause dur short okay erm well that sounds good pause dur short do you know when it is yet have you got a date
0	okay
0	yes i intend to
0	ah
0	hmm
0	i wouldn t mind watching mission impossible twoi
0	erm pause dur short i think i ve seen that one
0	and that s pause dur short well two things pause dur short firstly that s why you should do a shoulder check before starting to move rather than as you re starting to move
0	cos you suddenly put yourself in their blind spot and they re not expecting you pause dur short but the second important point is there i did something trunc i trunc that i could have done better and i want to improve on it next time
0	hmm
0	ah busy pause dur long still we re going the right way pause dur long as in not carrying on round is i think is er is the way to go isn t it
0	so interestingly legally pause dur short if i hadn t seen him and we had hit him that would have been his responsibility
0	because undertaking is actually illegal
0	oh pause dur short right pause dur short erm
0	wow
0	yeah pause dur long i going to have to start thinking about erm what to put on for my ipod pause dur short i m not used to having my music collection with me
0	well no i still like mine on the dock thank you very much
0	no we didn t pause dur short that was a joke
0	fair enough pause dur long event desc sound of music who s this
0	those boys don t understand the average speed limit pause dur short check
0	no
0	i still really want to go to lego land
0	you can just go pause dur short you re allowed
0	are you
0	yeah
0	the best one was either the one in the taxi or the land economy one
0	uh
0	we can skip it if you don t like it
0	this must be one of my running songs pause dur short i had no idea i had this
0	true true pause dur long i agree with the sentiment as well pause dur short just dance pause dur short problems er pause dur long
0	i m glad we both appreciate the traffic density for what it is
0	dense pause dur short yes indeed
0	dense like your mother
0	ah pause dur short dense like your face
0	i do yes pause dur short i do pause dur short oh i m quite excited about unclear
0	heather is there
0	erm she was she was like you know i was really upset when we you know we were talking about this in a bus stop and i was like i m crying in public pause dur short i haven t done this since i was mentally unstable last year pause dur short which was a you know a nice bit of er
0	yes
0	yeah definitely
0	oh yeah definitely pause dur short well no i i i ll decide
0	you are actually her boss
0	well actually i ve got a quite a nice timetable for her but i m i m gonna make her think things through for herself pause dur short as in if she asks me something i m going to say okay pause dur short if i give you this bit of information i want you to go and think about it and work it out for yourself pause dur short have a go pause dur short you know pause dur short just because sometimes you ve got to do that at work
0	yeah
0	and so i mean yeah some of them won t be finishable pause dur short so i wanted to get what she feels is a reasonable amount done while also completing some tasks and having other tasks as background tasks pause dur short same as cos that s how my work very much is pause dur short a lot of it isn t finishable but you have to keep doing it as a back as a side task alongside other things that you need to get done for a date you know pause dur short so i guess recognising urgency and deadlines and prioritising and stuff pause dur short i want her to practise pause dur short erm just all that kind of thing that she ll be able to then talk about in interviews pause dur short erm and just have a go at doing i think is important pause dur short having that freedom
0	erm yeah i m quite looking forward to it
0	oh dear
0	well at least we now have a washing up monkey
0	hmm
0	yeah pause dur long people unclear don t get the whole tv thing
0	trunc y trunc okay
0	yeah i was going to say it looked kind of american in style pause dur short big is basically what i meant by that
0	just haven t caught on pause dur short just imagine driving a yaris around america pause dur short it would be like ah
0	feeder
0	yeah well i had a diskman and i had a case for it that you could put six cds in the front and zip
0	yeah
0	oh dear
0	what
0	yeah odd that
0	unclear in a white audi tt
0	what ubiquitous fairly well earning women s cars then
0	yeah
0	it s not the car it s how it s driven
0	oh right okay pause dur short fair enough
0	erm which makes unclear quite unsuitable for a lot of road use
0	i e they re not very good for driving around a town centre
0	yeah
0	right pause dur short that s what i mean though like mentally fast and bright blue and sort of look at our stupid car
0	huh pause dur short yeah
0	right pause dur short nice pause dur short they told the reporter to chop off an appendage of his choice and throw it out of the window to save weight
0	yeah pause dur short that s good
0	ah pause dur short bless pause dur short what kind of a shrug and a yes it is nice car
0	oh okay
0	it is rather unfortunate the erm the ceo of volvo being german pronounces it wolwo pause dur short oh
0	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur short i m pleased you went with that option pause dur long yeah er yes
0	i can t
0	ah true yes pause dur short i can see you being chief engineer until you get to sort of retirement sort of time pause dur short i e about thirty five and then er thinking oh i ll be ceo for a year or two just you know
0	they wouldn t pay you very well
0	i i have seriously considered working for them but i think you have to be really quite good
0	ah pause dur short have you not
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short with a insane death penalty record
0	interrogation no though presumably
0	yeah
0	right
0	yeah pause dur short right
0	i don t know anything about it really pause dur short cos they re not particularly often kind of out and about pause dur short right okay
0	yeah i mean i m sure there are problems but less trunc ri trunc you know less extreme than so many other countries pause dur long
0	well quite yeah pause dur short yeah i mean that s the thing i think it from what i ve read about it there s still a lot of corruption erm which but i mean it s true of a lot of countries pause dur short and yeah unclear but yeah i mean hey pause dur short like you said america much
0	right pause dur long i mean it services are twelve miles is out pause dur short oh no so we re coming off so that s not ours is it
0	yeah

0	but er is there anyway through there we can get into
0	erm

0	yeah
0	it trunc w trunc
0	mm pause dur short trunc sh trunc speaking of nice short menus have a look at the wines

0	i hope
0	unclear
0	oh
0	i ve gotta stop proofreading things
0	yeah pause dur short but it s didn t specify you needed to push it so people were apparently waving their cards in front of it and then just standing and waiting
0	which is maybe their problem
0	yeah
0	work in publishers

0	mm
0	sure pause dur short thank you
0	so have you rung wimpey back about anything recently
0	mm
0	well yeah pause dur short i mean as er i
0	passively annoying
0	that s what i was saying pause dur short like a lot of the trunc t trunc you know they re really good to live next to pause dur short cos they don t make any noise
0	seem friendly
0	mm
0	right
0	anon nametype f type name and her partner pause dur short from the noise
0	how noisy can it be
0	side i think pause dur short but yeah i m just it just did make me a bit thankful that we fundamentally have done quite well

0	oh right pause dur short yeah
0	hmm pause dur short i do love that anon nametype n type name pause dur short i got his card pause dur short if you have a problem contact pause dur short vocal desc laugh

0	mm pause dur short er true
0	unclear the music somehow doesn t seem to fit the setting
0	oh i i think it does pause dur short it s nice
0	cos we used to have sort of reddy brown leather settees
0	it s a very good choice pause dur short it s really softening as well
0	there s a bit of a dent where i lean on
0	and we can sit independently pause dur short vocal desc laugh as in we can be you know don t have to look at each other and talk to each other pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short it s not a squeeze at all pause dur short you can get four on it pause dur short and that would be a squeeze pause dur short but you trunc cou trunc as in for a lot of sofas like getting three on would be
0	a squeeze
0	it s quite nice to have that option

0	like perfect as a starter pause dur short as in it was really tasty but not very er not too heavy pause dur short it s er
0	no no pause dur short yeah

0	unclear
0	there s a little there s a little fire going there
0	hmm
0	we should get a fire in our kitchen
0	my list of things from when we moved in
0	unclear fire blanket pause dur short in all fairness i d trunc f trunc if there was actually a fire i d have completely forgotten about those
0	cos they re just in there pause dur short i forget about them
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i think if yeah pause dur short it s not you know
0	unclear passport i suppose
0	it d be trunc cr trunc the problem is when you don t know someone s nicking your identity
0	yes
0	well surely that way you d just get it actively temperature controlled pause dur short you could put in a
0	which would
0	it won t be good if it s too dry
0	er

0	vocal desc laugh and i didn t particularly pause dur short but it was really
0	i really can t take you anywhere can i
0	thirty or forty
0	and that was a wine with each course
0	and it s like properly pricey pause dur short vocal desc laugh like er they had different levels pause dur short so they had like fixed price menu which was however much for three courses pause dur short you know pause dur short trunc c trunc expensive
0	unclear
0	pff pause dur short i m trying to remember the prices now actually pause dur short it was something like er forty five pounds for three courses
0	that s not too bad

1	shot into
1	in the championship
1	yeah yeah

1	that might be worth watching they re good sevilla
1	mm i felt a little bit sorry for hull
1	vocal desc laugh
1	at the weekend it was pause dur short you know they draw nil nil
1	yes yes that s right
1	and what doomed them losing to birmingham
1	that s right
1	wasn t it er a week
1	that s right
1	or so before
1	that s right that s right that s right
1	mm mm
1	i mean some clubs you ve you do feel charitable towards to sympathetic towards to
1	yes yeah
1	some you don t and you think you know if they trunc ev trunc for example if man city play against chelsea i want them both to lose and it s as simple
1	yeah yeah
1	as that you know
1	it s
1	preferably with people being sent off
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and all the rest of it that s right
1	yes or well er without anyone getting harmed but
1	no not harmed
1	the ground being destroyed as well you know vocal desc laugh
1	no exactly yes vocal desc laugh that s right not seriously long lasting injuries obviously
1	no no no
1	that would be too much
1	when everybody s gone you know and there s sort of a ray coming down from above
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	sort of flatten the place
1	unclear
1	yes
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	mm yes i i my heart does not go out to er chelsea s or pause dur short especially their manager i can t stand mourinho
1	he s a swine isn t he
1	mm pause dur short no he s not my cup of tea
1	no there are some insufferable people aren t there he s just one of them pause dur short i was actually i was thinking about that kind of insufferability in in people and kevin pietersen is another example of that
1	yes
1	er which well
1	yeah
1	people divide on this one which side are you on this one
1	i m i m glad he s not being picked i i i think trunc th trunc there is a place for decency and team trunc sh trunc manship
1	right
1	or you know the collegiality
1	yes right
1	and and he s a destroyer of it erm
1	true
1	sometimes you have to put up with but erm i think in his case he s past his best
1	oh that s a different kettle
1	you know
1	kettle of fish pause dur short but er against that which i fully agree with you pause dur short is the rather pause dur short genteel pause dur short criteria applied to people like alastair cook and others
1	uhu
1	who
1	mm
1	trunc wh trunc what s the phrase they used about him well he comes from the right kind of family
1	he s a good chap isn t he
1	and er a good chap that s right yeah
1	farming stock you know
1	farming stock yeah
1	or or at least his people are
1	trunc yea trunc his trunc peop trunc exactly his people are
1	and i think he married into farming stock
1	that s right as well
1	he he likes being down on the farm now
1	and he s a hunt and fish and shooting kind as well is he well
1	he s a decent chap you know he s well well educated
1	right
1	one of us
1	yeah went to the right school obviously
1	he must have done
1	must have done dear boy
1	you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm
1	you think if that s on the other side
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i m not sure which side i m really on here vocal desc laugh
1	i know trunc le trunc trunc le trunc well it s not a perfect world is it
1	no no it isn t
1	you know
1	that s right no
1	it s not a perfect world
1	that s it s right
1	you know
1	i think
1	erm
1	my only point of you know sympathy for the england team is they ve got moeen ali in it you know and you know that s
1	uhu
1	trunc goo trunc that s vocal desc laugh it seems to be a good thing whatever he s like as a player i don t know
1	yeah
1	he
1	oh he s he er he s a good shows
1	okay
1	a lot of promise he s not the finished article yet but he s trunc onl trunc he s only
1	right
1	played a handful of tests
1	right
1	but er
1	trunc h trunc how he manages presumably with somewhat different values he s a practicing muslim
1	yes
1	in that kind of environment in that sort of dressing room with very secular bantery
1	and
1	entitled middle class
1	celebrating with alcohol and all this
1	with alcohol and that kind of stuff
1	yes yeah yeah well he went on record as saying that erm i i want to be a good trunc s trunc a good muslim and i want to be a good cricketer and i want to show that the two
1	you can do the can be
1	you know
1	combined yeah
1	can can be combined
1	that s right
1	and erm
1	that s right yeah yeah yeah
1	erm somebody said of muhammad ali once that he was a credit to his race the human race
1	vocal desc laugh very good
1	you know
1	yes absolutely
1	and i now you could say that about
1	that s right that s right
1	he he seems a thoroughly erm professional
1	absolutely yeah
1	and likeable one man from what
1	that s right
1	one sees
1	true true true true
1	of his public persona you know
1	and he s avoided or er yeah that s probably the right word being treated like monty panesar was
1	yeah
1	of being somewhat patronised
1	i i i don t think he s been patronised er panesar it now looks as if trunc panes trunc well i think panesar was patronised but he was a different kind of character it looks as if there were demons in panesar s background from what we
1	right
1	now know
1	oh is that right
1	but er
1	i didn t know
1	yeah he s pause dur short he was caught erm he well he had troubles with his marriage and i think that folded and then he was caught urinating on a trunc g trunc on a guy outside a nightclub you know and
1	monty that s amazing
1	yes yeah
1	but that s not the image that i think was being promoted by the press of being a rather erratic cuddly
1	yeah well
1	er
1	there was something
1	devil may care
1	something happened in his life
1	eccentric
1	and there were trunc d trunc i mean and there were trunc o trunc obviously issues with drink
1	okay
1	cos er i think he was drunk
1	oh
1	when he did the
1	okay okay okay
1	thing outside the nightclub of the bouncers i think it was
1	graduate of this anon type place university
1	who panesar
1	yeah
1	is he
1	yes he is
1	well i didn t teach him i taught nick knight briefly er and
1	now that s a name from the distant past
1	well yeah he he had a reasonable career as an opener for england but he
1	is that right
1	only played about trunc twent trunc i say only he only played twenty times pause dur short and
1	when he came off the pitch did he say anon nametype m type name taught me everything i know
1	vocal desc laugh not about cricket he didn t no
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh trunc ye trunc he he might have
1	and how long did he last as a cricketer vocal desc laugh
1	he might he might have muttered something about pause dur short trunc th trunc the jury s still out
1	the criminal justice system vocal desc laugh
1	you know and anon nametype m type name has taught me the
1	oh the jury s still out vocal desc laugh
1	anon nametype m type name s taught me that
1	taught vocal desc laugh
1	i m innocent till proven guilty
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that kind of stuff yeah but he s a commentator now on sky but again he s not
1	okay
1	in the first rank of commentators he s sort of like in the
1	right right right
1	the reserve team
1	the trunc reser trunc when the others can t vocal desc laugh come in
1	yeah or you know the the top people who do the test matches
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	and pause dur short and then he s doing the county game or the
1	yeah
1	or they they switch to the twenty
1	yes
1	twenty game
1	right okay
1	trunc n trunc that would be nick knight and there are others not just him
1	for sure
1	you know there are others in that category and
1	and of course for all we know sitting in our lectures there might well be that next generation they people wander around with waitrose
1	oh yeah
1	written on their on their bags don t they
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	you know pause dur short it may well be
1	well especially in a place like this
1	unclear
1	mm
1	that s right yeah elite and all the rest of it yeah
1	yes well well i mean pause dur short as long as they
1	unclear seb coe unclear
1	as long as they can supply me with tickets to
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	oh yes pause dur short that s right you ve got a wimbledon connection
1	i ve got er but er he wasn t an elite tennis player
1	mm
1	but erm
1	if he was a member of the queen s club is that what it s called
1	no erm there used to be a young chap i can t remember his name now who was in politics and i taught him and he became a kind of a press officer for the pause dur short men s tour
1	right
1	and they played at anon type place and there were a couple of years when trunc h trunc he rang me up and got me tickets for that but i don t think he does it any more i think he s
1	right
1	gone off in a different career pause dur short but anon nametype m type name is the name of the young chap er
1	mm
1	well he s not a young well he s a sort of
1	yeah yeah
1	mid thirties now erm he was a student here and is an honorary official at wimbledon
1	right
1	and for about the last seven or eight years he s been kind enough to get me tickets for various things and this year he s got me two tickets for the men s final
1	fantastic
1	they re half price tickets
1	that s just fantastic
1	for the men s final cos he can buy them
1	yes yes
1	you know and share them out
1	that s just extraordinary isn t it
1	so they re not yet in my possession but
1	mm
1	the cheques have been cashed so to speak so i ve no
1	vocal desc laugh right
1	no reason to suppose that er
1	good
1	that it it won t work
1	good good good pause dur short i mean it s the kind of thing unclear whereas hence unclear people pay over the odds for isn t it
1	well i mean er i er er i will be going but erm er you know trunc th trunc the face value is a hundred and sixty pounds well er i i trunc w trunc i reckon i could sell that for
1	sure sure
1	over
1	yeah sure
1	five hundred pounds
1	exactly
1	if i wished to
1	only certain people get the chance to buy it at face value presumably
1	yeah well i mean you trunc y trunc
1	or does it go on open sale
1	no there is a there s ballot
1	uhu uhu
1	and so people put in for the ballot
1	uhu
1	but trunc tha trunc that s in the sort of november the year before
1	yeah
1	that kind of thing
1	right
1	and then there are small unclear pools unclear like obviously honorary officials who are allowed
1	sure
1	to buy
1	sure
1	a small number of tickets
1	numbers that s right yes
1	er and then there are debenture ticket holders they they can buy a ticket or so many tickets per day they hire a load to sell them for anything that they can get
1	no that s a bit pause dur short it s a bit er
1	well it s written
1	off isn t it
1	into the rules if so if you re got i think the last debenture call was you know you had to have something like sixty thousand pounds pause dur short but trunc i trunc if you
1	sixty thousand
1	if you were a twenty year old and you had sixty thousand or your parents did it s worth buying because
1	because you could make that back
1	you would you would make money on it
1	yes that s right
1	you know
1	in the long term that s true
1	yeah
1	i mean it just seems very unfair that you should be able to sell them on for profit
1	well
1	given that you re trunc y trunc well
1	well because to do so in any other class of ticket is illegal
1	well that makes it doubly so doesn t it
1	i think it
1	it makes it
1	i think it i think it s written on the tickets that i get from wimbledon you cannot
1	not for exchange
1	no not for resale
1	that s right that s right
1	or something like that you know
1	it s very hard to know how you could ever police such a system
1	well i d say it i mean unless it s going to come to the the to the trunc t trunc i mean i think some rock concerts have done this unless you have to turn up with a ticket and your passport
1	well
1	you know
1	in countries er we ve had this discussion before like italy and spain where
1	yeah
1	you must carry your dni all the time your pause dur short you know identity card
1	yeah
1	then it s plausible it s it s a feasible security system
1	yeah
1	to require people to bring their
1	yeah
1	identity trunc car trunc well cos they have to have it anyway
1	and trunc m trunc for all i know that may happen in er
1	well but not in britain because you re not
1	no
1	trunc y trunc you not everybody s got a passport for a start
1	no
1	and the last thing you wanna do is take it to a rock concert for god s sake
1	well exactly
1	it s a ridiculous thing to do
1	and pause dur short er and in any event there are there are so many ways around it because trunc y trunc you hear i don t know i i happened to read a review of paul mccartney recently
1	mm
1	and and they were saying he s still doing it at the age of
1	yeah
1	seventy something
1	yeah
1	but i know for a fact as soon as that came online people would have snapped up the tickets
1	yes
1	and then the following day when you thought all the tickets were gone there s a ticket agency that s suddenly selling them
1	sure
1	but not at a hundred pounds a shot
1	no no okay
1	you know
1	right yeah
1	so you know that that might have been legitimate
1	sure
1	but tickets are being sold above their
1	sure
1	face value
1	sure
1	and some people say oh well that s just the market that s supply and demand get used to it
1	well
1	and others say and including some trunc o trunc one or two actually trunc st trunc
1	mm
1	rock stars saying
1	yes
1	no no i
1	right
1	want them sold to fans at this price i don t want them
1	okay
1	going anywhere else
1	sure if they can get that
1	you know
1	er you know agreed er by the pause dur short by the er administrators that s fair enough but the kind of thing the the agency had a mind there is is legit because it s i think it s called ticket stop or something like that
1	yeah
1	and i got into arsenal that way because what they do is somebody sells back their trunc ti trunc
1	yeah
1	er it actually it was spurs sells back their ticket to
1	yeah
1	the agency at a price where they get three quarters of their money back
1	yeah
1	and the agency sells it at either face value or face value plus five percent
1	mm
1	so you get the chance to get a ticket pause dur short nobody loses too much who s bought
1	yeah i understand
1	whatever and they get a bit of an administration fee and so on
1	i trunc th trunc i think that may be an exception well well trunc m trunc maybe it is an exception to the rule but
1	they do it for all kinds of things unclear though unclear
1	what i was thinking of was slightly murkier
1	yes it is murkier
1	in the sense
1	sure
1	that they were getting hold of so many tickets
1	okay no that s
1	you know
1	a different kettle of fish okay right
1	that you wonder how it how it s being done you know and and the other big bone of contention of course is that er even even when things are legitimately being trunc s trunc sold through ticketmaster pause dur short you have to pay a booking fee
1	yes sure
1	and then you have to pay a percentage because you haven t got the right card
1	right right
1	and then there s postage
1	okay
1	on top of it
1	sure
1	and it s it s a rip off
1	sure
1	and i know that various trunc of trunc this and com that and all the rest of it were looking at
1	true
1	various charges they they really should start looking at at that
1	well er
1	cos i know roaming charges for phones have
1	yes have been
1	come down and come down in
1	right okay
1	in recent years
1	eventually people even people like ryanair realise that it s bad for their business and they have
1	yeah and in today s
1	exactly so
1	independent is a report on their profits having soared
1	soared after they ve
1	and their seat occupancy
1	right
1	rate having
1	sure sure
1	increased
1	i just
1	you know
1	held my nose and signed up for ryanair to go to er
1	yeah
1	abroad
1	yeah
1	and it s much better than it used to be
1	it is
1	there is still one thing which is it drives you crazy which is the pause dur short insurance
1	yeah
1	if you don t want insurance you look for the i don t want insurance pause dur short box to tick
1	mm
1	and it doesn t seem to be there
1	uhu
1	you ve got to go through trunc th trunc the list of the countries which the insurance applies to till you get beyond denmark and it s vocal desc laugh one of those don t want insurance
1	oh
1	and it that is it trunc ju trunc
1	that that is a bit naughty isn t it
1	it s a bit naughty that s right
1	yes you re right
1	and they could say well
1	it should simply well er
1	yeah
1	there are there there is a pause dur short somebody or something looking into that now trunc wh trunc whether it what powers it has i don t know
1	that s it exactly that s true yes
1	but you re right it doesn t look unclear in there unclear cos so many people whiz through it and suddenly it
1	sure sure
1	doesn t come out as seventy pounds
1	sure
1	it s eighty five and you wonder why
1	yeah why why is that
1	you know and you ve suddenly paid
1	sure sure
1	for insurance that perhaps you don t need
1	they re not the only ones
1	or you ve already got from somewhere else
1	i mean ryanair was er notorious but
1	yeah
1	i ve recently had done other things where
1	mm
1	you discover it at the end that there s actually there s a
1	mm
1	extra administration charge
1	mm
1	as well which hasn t been pause dur short er er advertised until right at the last moment and of course they know perfectly well that by the time you ve got there
1	yes
1	and it s trunc y trunc quotes only ten pounds or whatever
1	yeah
1	you think oh god you know what am i gonna do i might as well buy it so you just go ahead and do it
1	but it they they certainly have pause dur short become more human in their policy towards the paying public whereas there was no doubt that previously they treated the paying public like cattle and i wouldn t use them pause dur short er i have used them once since er to go krakow
1	right
1	but that was the only way i could get there i think erm
1	yes exactly so if there s any alternative
1	yeah
1	er very pleased to use any alternative
1	vocal desc misc er trunc g trunc going to pisa for instance er i decided i would drive to luton and take easyjet rather than
1	fine
1	go from birmingham i think it was with erm ryanair
1	yes if there s a choice of those two then they re both
1	yeah
1	they re both doable and yes i would avoid
1	yeah
1	mind you luton airport is so horrible er
1	well it is and there s roadworks there as well which didn t help
1	that s true
1	you know cos
1	that s true
1	i was going down by car but but having said trunc th trunc i mean easyjet have got become a little bit more friendly as well
1	true
1	you know and you can
1	you can allocated seats and all the rest of it
1	you yes and you
1	that s right
1	and you can buy seats at quite i mean i think i bought seats at five pound each way i mean
1	yes
1	that s nothing
1	that
1	you know
1	that s right not compared to the price of the
1	erm and i and the thing was i didn t have to worry about fighting my way on the plane and since i was right down the front i got off it very quickly and with hand luggage i was out through er
1	exactly
1	passport control
1	exactly
1	in no time at all
1	exactly
1	because i was first in the queue
1	exactly that s right yes er i i ve people are quite willing to pay the er five pounds for that
1	yeah i don t mind it for that
1	that s right it s in their interest
1	well i think i told you i had a whole bunch of trunc s trunc three seats to my on trunc m trunc to myself there and back pause dur short just by luck
1	yes just by luck you can t
1	mm yeah
1	legislate
1	no
1	for that
1	no
1	but when it happens it s a great bonus
1	yeah i mean well especially on a flight like that
1	where the legroom is gonna be pretty crap so anything
1	yeah
1	you get is a is a bonus really
1	yeah yeah so er
1	that s right
1	where are you off to anyway where where have you booked to go
1	erm pause dur short er at the end of september i m gonna go and see friends in barcelona
1	oh barcelona
1	yeah that s right
1	that s such a lovely place
1	i know i don t i just discovered though that it s on the same days as our open days
1	oh
1	so i hope i can get a er a friendly friend to er swap with me
1	ah
1	i ll do the june ones are you up for the june ones
1	yeah well i i m doing the june ones but then i have said i m on holiday in september so we do we tend trunc t trunc we have three on one and three on the other and that s the
1	okay
1	six of us
1	alright
1	so
1	that s fair enough
1	but i ve always said that i am i am not rearranging my holidays around university open days thank you very much so i ll
1	yes right
1	do the june i don t mind you know
1	yeah er
1	you know
1	i i think if if there s enough of anybody in the trunc grou trunc enough of people in the group
1	mm
1	that they some do this and some do that
1	yeah
1	then they could both get holidays it s not too bad
1	yeah
1	it s when you have to do there are so few of you that you have to do
1	it get
1	so
1	it gets to be tricky if x turns round just before the september one and says oh i ve suddenly realised i ve and
1	yeah no
1	and and no one s got any trunc f trunc sympathy
1	that that s not on
1	you know
1	that s not on
1	er and then if you are around the pressure is on well i know
1	it of
1	you did june but would you
1	i know
1	come in and do it you know
1	can you possibly er
1	but i think i ll be in zimbabwe anyway so i m i think i m beyond their reach

1	anyhow us guys began to recognise one another that we were all in the same boat so we started to make our way through anon type place er to get to anon type place someone had told us where it was and er as we approached it there was a sergeant coming down the road obviously looking for young bewildered men
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and er in the in the british army er the senior ncos wear a red trunc s trunc sash mainly over their right shoulder but his guy had his sash over his left trunc so trunc shoulder and that dates back to a battle many years ago when a lot of the officers of the anon type place light infantry were killed in action because they always wore their sash on the left shoulder
1	oh i see
1	and because the ncos took over on that day it was decreed that those guys should then wear their sash on the same side as the officers
1	right
1	again just going off tangent very slightly
1	yeah
1	erm there was a big coloured picture of a senior nco from every infantry regiment in the british army
1	yeah
1	taken outside of buckingham palace they d gone to meet the king
1	right
1	and the picture wasn t very clear but all these chaps lined up had their sash over the right shoulder but there was one there and you couldn t see his face over his left shoulder so
1	yeah
1	you know he was a anon type place
1	oh right yeah
1	anyhow we walked up through anon type place street
1	yeah
1	and there was the barracks
1	keep going yeah
1	erm formidable go in pause dur short get your name separate you there was an intake of eighty young men that day and it was to be the last national service intake for the anon type place light infantry and we were divided into two sections platoons there was anon type place platoon and anon type place platoon and those two names come from former generals that did their early days
1	right
1	in the regiment and we were directed to barrack rooms big victorian red brick barrack rooms cold they were heated by one open fire at each end and you were given a small amount of coke which was meant to last you for the week but in reality you could burn it in a day
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	and we went in we were given some bedding and not proper uniform to start with but denims which was enough to carry on with pause dur short and er so that was the first day we were talked to by this very frightening sergeant that i saw in the street not only did he have a red sash he had a very red face and frightening face and to further pause dur short diminish his appearance in the eyes of unclear anybody he knew unclear the poor chap
1	yeah
1	had a cross eye
1	oh dear vocal desc laugh
1	so vocal desc laugh
1	not good for firing then
1	he he trunc l trunc well he er
1	vocal desc laugh
1	he was alright actually
1	yeah
1	perhaps he closed his bad eye
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	but er vocal desc cough but anyhow the next day we were taken for getting the uniform issued to us and er the quartermaster was a chap called major anon nametype m type name who was very proud to say smoking his pipe so he was quite casual i was here like you thirty six years ago and he d gone all the way up through and he had a wonderful eye and he could say look at people and say size that size that
1	mm
1	and all the way through and this thing was issued
1	oh right
1	and then it came to greatcoats and you were told to put on a greatcoat and er he said when i look at you don t look down because if you look forward your coat will droop in the front
1	oh right yeah
1	so of course he got to me and the first thing i did was look down
1	yeah
1	so he said to me don t look down there s bugger all there vocal desc laugh and that was his
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that was his expression but erm again towards that end of the first week the army being very crafty they decide you should have all your injections on a friday because some of them were very painful
1	yeah
1	and they wanted to give you the saturday and sunday in your own time to get over them
1	gosh
1	so one of them was er what they called a tab injection
1	yeah
1	you probably know this
1	erm well
1	it s a mixture of er typhus
1	everything
1	or trunc t trunc everything together
1	mm
1	and it s extremely painful
1	yeah
1	and i remember a big red mark coming up on my arm and it was a very sharp boundary to this red mark and ordinary
1	yeah
1	flesh if you touched the red oh
1	mm
1	but you d go trunc s trunc at half an inch the other way and it was normal
1	yeah yeah
1	anyhow we were all taken off to what was anon type place camp in those days
1	oh right
1	and er because that s where the medical officer was
1	right
1	and given all these injections in fact the medical officer was a retired colonel from the royal army medical corps
1	oh right
1	cos i don t think they had enough
1	right
1	proper chaps
1	yeah
1	and er he sitting there in his woolly cardigan
1	mm
1	and you know he s oh you know sort of thing
1	yeah
1	but er quite interesting anyhow also given to us that day was the smallpox
1	right
1	you know it was a sort of
1	yeah
1	scratchy thing
1	yeah
1	which brings you up in a
1	yeah
1	in a sore
1	yeah
1	and erm we had that my injection were alright but the smallpox thing didn t so
1	right
1	on my own i had to make me way instead of being taken by army lorry taken back to anon type place camp er
1	right
1	er you know i walked
1	yeah oh right
1	and erm the extraordinary thing trunc th trunc you know he did it again and then i had to make my own way back to the barracks
1	mm
1	in anon type place street
1	yeah
1	well er i went through anon type place park
1	oh right
1	and i didn t wanna get back too quickly
1	yeah
1	so i sat down in the pavilion there in the seats outside
1	yeah
1	so that was nineteen fifty nine never ever for a second dreaming
1	right
1	that i might come back there one day
1	no no
1	to run a railway
1	no
1	but anyhow trunc a trunc army life started and er reveille was at half past five in the morning
1	right
1	they d give you an hour to get sorted out and half past six you would go for breakfast get marched to the cookhouse in those days too the boots they issued you with had hobnails so as you marched you made a tremendous crashing noise through
1	yes
1	erm and to get you up from bed of course they blew reveille on bugle
1	yes
1	and i often used to think about the people who lived in ordinary houses in anon type place street
1	yeah
1	because their life must have been regimented really by by the army totally
1	yes absolutely
1	erm the assault course in those days was in anon type place all the way down through
1	oh right
1	and er as you go past our track at anon type place park
1	yes
1	there s a little building on the right which was the indoor rifle range
1	yes
1	go on again and you re there
1	there s a rifle
1	but of trunc cour trunc
1	range down there isn t there
1	there was a full bore rifle range
1	trunc ye trunc full trunc rif trunc well it s still there
1	oh it s trunc st trunc er
1	it s still we we frequently walk that way
1	mm i ve not been down there
1	we come yeah the it s
1	so
1	well it was still there last time i went so
1	yeah yeah
1	sorry to stop you
1	no that s okay but you know er talking about the crashing of hobnails i used to think about those poor people in anon type place street because if they decided that you would go down to anon type place
1	right
1	we d all go crashing down through anon type place street but nobody could have got any sleep there but i m sure they were quite used to it
1	er weren t they very slippery on the tarmac as well
1	no
1	they didn t slide
1	no no no they you er got no sympathy for that you just dug your heels in
1	oh right
1	in fact i dug my heels in so hard i bruised my heel
1	oh dear
1	and i made my way back to the it was sometime
1	mm
1	afterwards to see the that same retired doctor
1	right
1	at anon type place camp
1	right
1	and er he just said oh excused boots for two or three days
1	oh right
1	so you couldn t take part in drill practice
1	oh right
1	or anything like that pause dur short er so trunc g trunc going on from there pause dur short you were ten weeks at that stage
1	uhu
1	supposedly pause dur short in in anon type place street but er i had a bit of a problem because i d been working in an office for years and i had no upper body strength
1	yeah mm
1	and one of the things you had to do was to heave on a parallel bar and i just couldn t do it and i couldn t
1	no
1	climb a rope
1	no no
1	so they decided that i should go off to anon type place camp in the middle of all this
1	right
1	on a on a pt development course
1	oh lord yeah
1	and it was fun it was er a most odd lot of people there that you ever met
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i discount myself from that but i must say it was the most
1	vocal desc cough
1	wonderful
1	excuse me
1	course
1	yes
1	because at the end of four weeks
1	mm
1	i i could climb a rope like a bloody monkey
1	really
1	and i could trunc thr trunc throw myself i used
1	gosh
1	oh yes it was it was hard you started off the day with the running a mile
1	oh
1	and then er you would do what they called corrective pt
1	right
1	now in the erm gymnasium there were the wall bars
1	yeah
1	and you would strap your ankles under the bars
1	right
1	and heave up on that and
1	right
1	down with your hands and weightlifting it was pretty hard work and then later in the day you d run a marathon do a short marathon three miles or so
1	yeah yeah
1	and er then perhaps play a game of hockey or something so it was er
1	right
1	but on top of this the army decided that you had to be fed up
1	right
1	i i don t like milk so you got a pint of
1	no
1	milk a day which i always managed to get rid of
1	yeah
1	and do you remember virol pause dur short you see
1	er
1	the orange signs on railway stations now virol anaemic girls need it
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	virol er growing boys need it well my mother used to buy that during the war
1	right
1	and because there trunc w trunc of course there were no tins so it came in a sort of waxy carton
1	i don t trunc rememb trunc
1	with unclear screw top unclear
1	i don t remember
1	you re not old enough
1	well no no no i am i am i am because actually my father was stationed in anon type place
1	oh was he
1	in in nineteen in nineteen fifty nine
1	mm
1	in anon type place barracks
1	wow
1	in anon type place
1	what was he in
1	erm the royal engineers
1	well that s funny because a lot of us anon type place boys thought it strange that we were sent to the anon type place
1	right
1	but the anon type place light infantry and the anon nametype m type name of anon type place light infantry
1	yeah
1	were due to merge in october of nineteen fifty nine in anon type place
1	really
1	yes so
1	gosh
1	i left the regiment before then
1	yes
1	because they sent me off elsewhere
1	right well i
1	do you want me to keep going
1	pardon yeah oh hang on a minute trunc wh trunc what have we done erm you ve trunc g trunc you we ve got another five minutes
1	okay keep going
1	erm mm well just to say my father was the chaplain at anon type place barracks in anon type place
1	oh well i m blessed
1	and he didn t have a he didn t have a church i mean he had to take his services in the naafi
1	yeah
1	which was quite interesting
1	yes
1	and erm but what they did was the royal engineers bought er built him a church
1	oh how wonderful
1	they built him a church and and it was trunc won trunc it was wonderful
1	mm
1	er and it was wonderful it but it was in an old a nissen hut
1	yeah
1	you know the black erm corrugated er iron
1	yeah
1	type huts and erm and then erm he he when we left when daddy left anon type place we heard that the church had been burnt down
1	oh
1	which was terribly sad
1	yeah isn t it just
1	erm and i went back just before they erm left the barracks about erm oh dear was it five years ago and erm and and saw where the church had been and i took anon nametype m type name over there
1	oh very nice
1	it was it was great
1	yeah
1	but anyway anon nametype m type name carry on with your story cos this is your story not mine
1	yeah okay well
1	vocal desc laugh
1	everything is interesting yes trunc a trunc after i came back from this pt course and
1	mm
1	was pause dur short jumping around like a monkey
1	oh yeah
1	er they decided then that i should go in and don t go laughing into the intelligence corps
1	oh right
1	because the cyprus emergency was still on
1	right
1	and the intelligence corps never took national servicemen directly from
1	right
1	whatever school or whatever it was but they picked the ones they wanted from other regiments
1	right
1	supposed to be intelligent but that was wrong anyhow i got selected to go off so i left anon type place on the day of the passing out parade in nineteen fifty nine which i was very sad about
1	yeah
1	because on that day the regimental band had come down from anon type place
1	yeah
1	and they were practising you know first of all marching up and down on the square wonderful sight and the sound
1	yeah
1	of the band and the bugles was really wonderful so i was sorry to go
1	yeah
1	but anyhow i got the train to er anon type place got to anon type place and then was picked up by a lorry and taken to camp vocal desc cough so again it was real mixture of people
1	mm
1	because we re all wearing different regimental badges
1	mm
1	from all over the place and we started then what would turned out to be about six months of so training and i was earmarked to go to cyprus
1	mm
1	but then fortunately before i went the cyprus emergency was over
1	right
1	so i never got there so er the towards the end of nineteen fifty nine they were wondering what to do with all these people
1	uhu
1	that they trained up
1	yeah yeah
1	so they started a new strategic reserve in the army which was a series of brigades that were on short notice call in case there was emergency anywhere
1	oh right
1	so when i finished my training they said where do you want to go so i thought my only chance to travel is either hong kong or singapore i ll i ll go there
1	yeah
1	so i end up in anon type place
1	vocal desc laugh ah
1	so vocal desc laugh i was i trunc w trunc we yes er we we we the we were a very small unit there were only about nine or ten of us
1	mm
1	and er we drove down to anon type place and we were given vehicles we had two land rovers and a one tonner and i drove a land rover down to plymouth with a trailer on the back which quite interesting but of course no one ever called us so i was home every weekend
1	right
1	go home on the train and
1	yeah
1	that was quite nice but we did a couple of interesting exercises from there and then towards the end of nineteen sixty
1	uhu
1	they decided they didn t want us anymore so then they had to find another home for us
1	right
1	erm and then i er got sent to anon type place so
1	oh
1	i had about
1	that was a bit better
1	mm it was nice
1	yeah
1	er we the the the er it was headquarters anon type place command and er our our offices up there were on the estate of the anon type place
1	oh right
1	at anon type place at anon type place
1	oh right right
1	because from where we were just walk up the road you could see the anon type place
1	yeah yeah
1	and that was very nice so from there erm pause dur short two of us we used to go off and do surveys the main job of the unit really was to check the security of armouries because even in those days they were getting frightened
1	right
1	of the ira
1	right
1	they would do a unclear raise to pinch rifles unclear
1	right
1	so erm i mean the one notable trip that i did we we drove from anon type place to anon type place
1	right
1	went up through anon type place which was wonderful and then right across anon type place to the east coast
1	right
1	and all the way up north to anon type place and anon type place
1	right
1	so i did actually get to see anon type place when i was out there
1	oh did you
1	and that trunc th trunc that was nice
1	oh right oh right
1	er
1	so what are we doing here er just just another couple of minutes er
1	oh right so erm there we are anyhow pause dur short erm
1	well erm what did you think going back to anon type place
1	yes
1	what did you think about anon type place then because they were rebuilding then a lot after the war anon type place
1	yes
1	was so badly bombed wasn t it
1	yes a lot of it had actually been finished by then
1	yeah
1	but of course some of those buildings they put up then they ve pulled down again
1	right
1	but one of the places we used to frequent there was the naafi club
1	right
1	which we d go in there
1	yeah
1	and i met a a chief petty officer off an indian frigate it was an brand new whitby class frigate
1	right
1	which the indians had come over to pick up from the builders in this country
1	yeah
1	and they got as far as the english channel and it broke down
1	right
1	so it came in to er anon type place to be repaired
1	right yeah
1	and er got talking to this guy he was very nice and he said oh come on board for lunch
1	yeah
1	so erm i thought i don t know about navy you know
1	mm
1	you you hear about saluting the quarterdeck and all that sort of thing
1	yeah
1	and i wasn t familiar so i went in civvies
1	right
1	and was met by this guy and er had lunch with him and it was curry
1	right yeah
1	surprise surprise
1	they would always have curry
1	yeah
1	they did in the royal engineers every sunday
1	vocal desc laugh
1	every sunday
1	vocal desc laugh yeah well trunc ye trunc they have curry
1	yeah
1	every day but on sundays they have chicken curry
1	oh trunc rea trunc vocal desc laugh
1	so that was a treat and er the the the the sweet was an apple
1	oh right oh
1	so that was
1	ah interesting
1	that was interesting
1	yes
1	so i saw this this brand new
1	mm
1	frigate
1	yeah
1	which was being repaired and never of course heard from the guy again
1	no
1	but there we are
1	no isn t it interesting
1	yeah
1	these encounters and i i was looking back last night on groups of people i ve known through the years
1	mm
1	because i moved about quite a lot and i don t see them now or i don t hear from them and you think it s a shame really
1	yeah
1	but then you move on in life
1	yeah
1	you can t hang on to every experience
1	yeah
1	can you not really so we ve done it anon nametype m type name so erm
1	well done
1	so i ll just erm
1	i hope it s
1	to get the strimmer working erm then obviously i m not i m gonna be wanting to wear my real scruffy clothes
1	right pause dur short yeah
1	because you can get oil on you and all sorts of things
1	yes unclear right unclear
1	i ve already trunc real trunc i ve got a mark on those white trousers which i m thinking could be oil i mean i haven t used them in the garden but you sometimes get oil on you even from things like a car door
1	yeah it can happen
1	erm pause dur short but i ve put them through the washing machine and it didn t shift so erm
1	oh
1	things like oil are difficult
1	yes
1	erm so pause dur short cereals cutlery no unclear got both vocal desc laugh bread things to put on bread
1	right
1	the milk erm is still in the fridge er there is some juice as well if you want it but otherwise i wouldn t i ve held my coffee i haven t had coffee yet
1	okay alright i ll start off with some
1	erm
1	cereal of some sort
1	and oh yes what i didn t say was there s a little bowl with a few strawberries left in it in the fridge if you want to put those on your cereal they could do with using
1	oh oh well
1	i sort of pause dur short i ve been tending to do that i sort of start it in the strawberry season and then carry on vocal desc laugh erm if if something doesn t seem to have a lot in i ve got that maple and pecan one there s another packet in here so that would be fine pause dur long i could have been doing this knitting when we were talking last night i ve never taken so flipping long to knit a sleeve vocal desc laugh
1	to what sorry
1	to knit a sleeve
1	oh vocal desc laugh right
1	erm pause dur short i start cos i started it before i went away and then of course i didn t take it with me because i always worry if i m travelling if i take knitting with me either the needles might break in the suitcase or i might have something stolen and lose that wool or you know so erm but i have been back a week vocal desc laugh and i still haven t finished the damn thing
1	you still haven t finished the sleeve right
1	mm pause dur long
1	no once you ve got what you want i ll go in there and and make the coffee but
1	wait wait sorry go again
1	i said once you ve got what you want i ll go in there and make the coffee but there isn t really room for both of us at the same time
1	yeah right pause dur long this looks like a new milk is that it
1	yes erm because i ve been using that almond milk
1	oh right
1	which is actually quite nice on cereal i don t know how it cooks though so i would have needed to buy some normal milk anyway because i wanted to use some in cooking
1	mm
1	erm and i don t really want to present you with a failed experiment vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	so finish those strawberries i said
1	yeah pause dur short alright
1	no i ll start doing that putting a few strawberries on cereal in the strawberry season and then i sort of gradually realise that it s not vocal desc laugh really the strawberry season anymore and i m still doing it vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh yeah exactly
1	but er pause dur long well they can t be that expensive cos i would have noticed i mean there comes a point with a lot of fruit where it s still available but it s suddenly become ridiculously expensive
1	mm
1	at which point i normally stop buying it
1	yep
1	erm so i don t know where they get their strawberries from at this time of year
1	mm
1	i know actually that the fruit from vocal desc cough where i go fruit picking
1	mm
1	which is just beyond anon type place erm i know that seems like a long way to go but it s really good quality stuff and so on
1	mm
1	whereas anything more local i ve gone and it if you plough your way through nettles and thistles to get at the strawberries i just think
1	no no
1	and they ve got a lot of places just have strawberries and this place has got a whole range of things
1	mm mm
1	including you know peas and stuff as well erm and i particularly like raspberries they re my favourite fruit erm but their notice said pause dur short up to the end of august for both strawberries and raspberries
1	really
1	which surprised me
1	mm
1	so they obviously just have a whole range of varieties
1	mm mm
1	and plant them at trunc diff trunc at slightly different times and
1	yeah yeah
1	just manage it because it s in their interest
1	mm
1	to have it going as long as possible
1	if you can keep it the season going great
1	mm
1	great of course for them
1	true pause dur short no i i the only reason why i didn t try raspberries this year was i was just it was just there would have been too many things you know my mum grows them but they re a bit pathetic
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm but i ve actually been over pause dur short three times to their trunc frui trunc i normally just go once you know but i went once on my own and then i took my mother cos it s a farm shop with pause dur short er a caf a trunc mu trunc er
1	mm
1	in the caf i realised why this year that they ve expanded the caf since last year pause dur short erm so i took her for lunch one day erm pause dur short and i just went and did a very little quick pick whilst she was walking between the vocal desc laugh car and the caf more or less i mean
1	vocal desc laugh
1	slight exaggeration there but you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm
1	unclear
1	she she s very slow these days vocal desc laugh
1	unclear well unclear
1	erm and and then bought some some things from the shop cos they have stuff that they ve picked in the shop as well you know
1	mm mm mm
1	erm pause dur short and then i was oh i know where i went i went to erm pause dur short anon type place deserted medieval village does that mean anything to you
1	no
1	erm there are quite a lot of pause dur short deserted medieval villages around i think
1	uhu
1	but this one s in anon type place er it s english heritage pause dur short er and obviously a lot of of such places may have been deserted in medieval times but then they were built on later so this is
1	right
1	just in a in a field kinda thing so i mean it s mostly lumps in the grass
1	mm
1	erm but the church is still
1	you need a vivid imagination
1	yeah erm the church is still a building albeit roofless it was used for quite a long time as a parish church
1	mm mm
1	after people had gone from the village itself pause dur short erm but it was excavated for quite a long something like between nineteen fifty nine and nineteen ninety nine you know i mean a really long period of time
1	vocal desc laugh right
1	and presumably not continuously but but every year they d go and do a season erm so i presume that the grass that you re seeing there now has grown over since they excavated
1	yeah
1	erm and it s a nice day out so
1	and is the history a bit known you know was it
1	well
1	was it the plague or or did
1	no
1	or was it just economic unclear
1	it was just it it yes er
1	was it a
1	enclosure the initially the the you know the it was taken over by a new landlord who trunc en trunc enclosed the land
1	mm mm
1	for erm sheep farming and and
1	right
1	therefore they didn t need the tenant farmers so much
1	mm mm
1	and that sort of started the decline and then just the long slow decline i think
1	mm m
1	and it wasn t a sort of pause dur short but it was later than the plague
1	mm mm okay
1	erm but because it s a free site there isn t a pause dur short little kiosk with a little man in it you know
1	mm mm yeah
1	but when i went to er anon type place priory which is probably last year now pause dur short which is the nearest manned site in their in their shop they had guidebooks to anon type place and thought that would be a good idea because i ve been before but i mean obviously yes there are notices up on the site but you get more information from the guidebooks that they do so i thought right okay i ll do that i ll go and erm i ll buy the guidebook now and at some point i ll go over there and and just hadn t got round to it and hadn t got round to it and it was a beautiful day so i did that and and it s actually really near the fruit farm so it just made sense to go there on the way back
1	right
1	and oh yeah that was one i had this really weird experience with my car that i d come through anon type place it s that sort of area
1	mm mm
1	and pause dur short there was a bit of a mess because there s a bridge pause dur short that has got a traffic lights on it cos it s too narrow for two way traffic
1	okay yeah
1	and then just beyond that was some really serious roadworks with a one way traffic light and the traffic was coming through and blocking everything so that
1	yep yep yep
1	erm and i realised also when i finally got beyond the lorry that was in front of me and could see what was happening it was it wasn t a it wasn t a traffic light it was a convoy pause dur short which is always slower so you re waiting for this thing to come and lead you through you know
1	yep right yep yep yep
1	erm but i was stuck behind something big that i and so i couldn t see past this you always are in those situations
1	yeah right
1	and we were sitting for ages so i switched my engine off pause dur short finally we started moving i switched my engine on and started moving and there s this horrendous noise as of pause dur short engine knocking
1	mm mm
1	you know and i thought something was gonna fall you know i thought the engine was gonna fall on the floor through through the it was just awful pause dur short i only had to go a couple of hundred yards before the end of the roadworks was actually the entrance into the fruit farm
1	right
1	so i went in there and parked when i set off again nothing at all and the only thing i can think of is i had my windows open cos it was hot but actually it wasn t my engine at all it was somebody else s i was hearing
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	but it was so alarming
1	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur short maybe it was
1	and i m driving on thinking well i can t break down here because i m in the middle of all this one way whatsit and
1	right right yeah
1	it would hold everybody up for hours vocal desc laugh
1	yeah right
1	vocal desc laugh but er trunc d trunc do you want your coffee with your breakfast shall shall i make the coffee now or do you want it
1	yep yeah that d be fine pause dur long
1	and are you a milk in coffee person
1	no
1	no so you re like me black no sugar
1	absolutely
1	right jolly good i ll clear that
1	oh okay vocal desc cough pause dur long
1	well they suggested doing it while you re cooking or something cos it gives you something to do which is all very well but you do move around and you do bang things on the table when you unclear
1	so what what bread is this
1	er that is wheat unclear and rye that s not one i ve made that s morrison s
1	oh i see
1	erm pause dur short i m waiting until i get this stuff pause dur short before i do any pause dur short more bread making which as i said should be arriving soon so pause dur short unclear pause dur long you ve got a homemade raspberry from the place i stayed last week
1	uhu
1	and unhomemade blackcurrant and honey and that is quince jelly that my mum gave me that somebody that she knows makes if you see what i mean
1	what trunc w trunc
1	oh and the other trunc th trunc
1	which is quince jelly this
1	that one that s says quince jelly on the side
1	that one oh sorry
1	and that is my marmalade
1	oh unclear rye
1	which i can recommend
1	i m sure you can pause dur long i will take these straight off to the table
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	ah
1	yes i stopped bothering to make raspberry jam because it s very easy
1	yep
1	erm but i was pause dur short using raspberries from this fruit farm which were fairly pricey and though when i knew i was making jam i sort of they ve got quite big pause dur short trunc containe trunc punnets that you pack into and i found because it s quite a long way by the time i ve driven home if you fill the punnets fairly full the thing that s in the bottom has already started to got
1	oh i see
1	unclear it s really squashed you know
1	yeah yeah
1	so that was actually quite good for making jam
1	vocal desc laugh right yes yeah
1	and as i say
1	pre squashed unclear drinks unclear vocal desc laugh
1	pre squashed raspberries yes erm but pause dur short although it s very straightforward actually you can buy perfectly nice raspberry jam whereas the marmalade
1	mm
1	you cannot buy even in a farm shop marmalade as nice as that i don t think
1	right
1	i mean see what you think maybe you don t agree it depends what kind of marmalade you like but pause dur long so even though marmalade is very faffy i make some every year
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur long
1	mm that s nice marmalade
1	mm that s just delia
1	mm yeah
1	erm pause dur short but i ve never had the recipe not work erm pause dur short and it s a bit you know you you re boiling it well no you re simmering it for two hours so that the er pulp softens and everything
1	mm
1	well that s a bit difficult to gauge because one person s simmer is another person s boil if you see what i mean
1	yeah
1	for for when it s as long as two hours that could make quite a bit of difference
1	yeah
1	to how much water has actually evaporated and therefore to the whole consistency so i would have thought it would vary enormously from year to year but actually doesn t that much
1	it doesn t right pause dur long
1	there we go so now pause dur short check that that is the right sort of strength for you
1	okay
1	cos i ve done it at the right strength for me
1	they are nice mugs aren t they
1	and yeah and if it isn t i ll put a little bit more water in
1	mm that s fine
1	that s fine good you re about the only person i know who doesn t go yar when they drink my coffee vocal desc laugh
1	it s a good solid brew i mean definitely yes but that s fine with me
1	mm pause dur long and that is that quince thing is so weird because if you flip the top you realise pause dur short it obviously was something holding cinnamon or something it s trunc ob trunc it s not meant for jam at all
1	right right
1	vocal desc laugh it s trunc mean trunc meant for slices
1	right yeah yeah it s a pepper pot or whatever isn t it
1	and it s actually it s yes and it s too narrow to put a spoon into
1	ah
1	you can put a knife in but you couldn t put i erm vocal desc laugh you could not fit a spoon in vocal desc laugh very weird
1	and did did you say your mother made this
1	no no
1	no
1	somebody that she knows made it and gave it to her
1	somebody she knows yeah
1	i m always getting she s well anon nametype f type name s gone now the anon nametype f type name was the woman who lived next door to her
1	mm right
1	erm you know when we were kids the the anon nametype f type name and anon nametype m type name lived next door and he was pause dur short something like latvian and i m not actually very sure
1	ah
1	and she was italian
1	right
1	so they both spoke fairly broken english pause dur short erm i mean obviously they used english to communicate with each other and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	managed to have a perfectly good relationship for all those years but erm but she he died quite a long time ago and she d been continually living next to pause dur short my mum
1	yeah
1	and she after what anon nametype f type name s three years older than me and obviously she was born here cos they must have met here you know
1	mm
1	so she must have been in this country for about fifty seven years or something like that and she still sounds as if she just arrived off the boat from naples
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i mean just so difficult to follow
1	mm
1	really really heavy accent really peculiar grammar and and erm even i found it difficult so and erm you know my mum would sort of sit there smiling and nodding sometimes vocal desc laugh you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm but er she grew oregano in her garden
1	mm mm
1	erm as possibly italians will you know i don t know
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but obviously far more than she needed so she d give my mother an enormous polythene bagful of oregano well pause dur short however much you like herbs you don t really need huge great bags of them one normally buy them in little sachets from the unclear supermarket unclear vocal desc laugh
1	yeah right right
1	so my mother passes things like that onto me and pause dur short then as i say she s got these apple trees erm pause dur short which are cooking apples pause dur short so i get those
1	right
1	erm and tomatoes which i don t mind at all
1	vocal desc laugh
1	which i have tried to grow but because i tend to go away in june
1	yeah mm mm
1	that s then they trunc nee trunc i m away when they need watering erm
1	right
1	one year i took my tomato plants around and left them in my mother s greenhouse when i was away vocal desc laugh but then in what sense are they my tomatoes they re really hers
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm so i ve stopped bothering but again pause dur short actually home grown tomatoes particularly if you do not put them in the fridge if she just when she brings trunc the trunc she ll give me a little handful and i ll try and keep most of them out on the work surface and and use them fairly quickly
1	yeah yeah
1	they just have so much more flavour than anything from the supermarket
1	yes yeah very good pause dur long
1	but that s why really why i guess why i want to get my orchard up and running
1	yeah
1	because she s not gonna be around forever and i suspect you know she s got two blackcurrant bushes and i love blackcurrants and i ve been going and harvesting from her
1	mm
1	previously er and i did a bit this year but of course i did have a few of my own next year i m sure i ll have more but i suspect if one of hers dies or something she probably just won t bother to replace it
1	right
1	erm and then of course we don t know how long she s gonna go on for
1	no well well how old is she
1	eighty three
1	mm mm
1	erm and i think her mother was something like eighty seven pause dur short erm and my grandma anon nametype n type name was ninety two or ninety three that sort of age
1	uhu
1	but she was in a home you know she could really couldn t manage on her own
1	mm mm
1	erm she had she had shingles and was taken into hospital and pause dur short because of her age before they let her go back into her council house they sort of ran her through various tests in the hospital you know i think they put take them into a kitchen and see whether they can make themselves a cup of tea sort of thing
1	mm mm
1	and decided that she wasn t fit to live on her own and we were going oh my god because my mother s mother was really really adamant she was not going into anywhere and she had pause dur short stroke after stroke at intervals you know and every time she she lost a little bit of mobility and
1	yeah yeah
1	and she was mentally she was absolutely fine but but pause dur short she could just about move around her own house with a zimmer frame and luckily it was a bungalow pause dur short and she had meals on wheels
1	mm
1	for lunchtime five days a week
1	right right
1	er and a home help who came in i don t know how frequently and a very nice next door neighbour who was just as old as she was but used to
1	vocal desc laugh
1	go and knock on her door every day pause dur short and trunc w trunc on at least one occasion he he basically saved her life because she what she didn t he realised that i don t know whether he d actually knocked on the door but her bedroom curtains were still drawn and she was always up
1	mm
1	so he called an ambulance and she d actually had a stroke while she was getting undressed the night before and spent the whole night sitting in a chair in her underwear unable to move
1	right
1	and was sort of ended up being rushed to hospital wrapped in foil cos she had hypothermia
1	yeah right right yeah
1	a non central heated bungalow of course
1	vocal desc laugh
1	of course
1	erm and that was weird as well because it was when i was at school pause dur short and i used to be taken to school but a neighbour whose daughter went to the same school pause dur short and i pause dur short was standing by his car on his drive waiting for them to come out of the house
1	right
1	cos they were faffing about and i heard an ambulance go by along the main road and you can be it s quite a long distance away but it comes up pause dur short cos my parents house is higher than
1	mm
1	the unclear road and i remember thinking i hope that s not my grandma
1	mm
1	and it probably had been cos she had been taken in at about that time
1	that time oh really mm pause dur short yeah
1	but well she had her wish in the end pause dur short she did die in her own home
1	mm
1	but you know if she d lived in a country without all those social services she obviously wouldn t have been able to carry on
1	yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur short but no my dad s mum pause dur short we were as i say we were sort of going oh dear because we knew what my grandma anon nametype n type name had been like and thinking pause dur short she s not gonna like this
1	yeah
1	erm so my dad and his sisters sussed out a few places and took her to look at them and she like oh yeah this is really nice and she
1	oh oh yeah vocal desc laugh
1	settled in and she used to gossip about the pause dur short erm what do i mean i don t mean inmates i mean i actually
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i don t even mean i don t mean the patients i mean the staff
1	the staff right
1	you know and she found a a gentleman friend
1	mm
1	who used to have a very mild flirtation with over a cup of tea i that vocal desc laugh was really was all that happened
1	ah pause dur short right
1	erm and was perfectly happy so people just are so different
1	yeah yeah
1	but i i know my mother wouldn t pause dur short she s more docile than her mother but she wouldn t be happy
1	no no pause dur short vocal desc cough one of the people i visited on this trip where i was pause dur short er er da da da round trunc eng trunc round britain as it were
1	mm
1	was erm pause dur short er anon nametype f type name who is pause dur short ninety four
1	right
1	and pause dur short she s lived in the same house for about pause dur short forty years or so but it is a bungalow
1	mm
1	and she can erm pause dur short er she can just about look after herself pause dur short she s she s bright as a button but her her legs weren t always doing
1	mm
1	what she wants them to but she pause dur short she s got a pause dur short a a sort of trolley on wheels
1	yes
1	things and she pause dur short er pause dur short makes a point of going down to round to a village shop at least once a week
1	mm
1	which is a big well it s only i could sort of walk it in well pause dur short five minutes probably but
1	mm but it s a big trip for her vocal desc laugh
1	but for her like that s that s a big trip what i really like about her is that she is determined she is gonna do it and i mean she s not bloody minded when it s been snowing or something
1	mm
1	she she says vocal desc laugh no i won t go today but but she is determined that she is gonna keep on going and she s got lots of friends who say oh you know we ll run you down there in the car
1	mm
1	or we can get things for you no no no
1	no oh it s much i if you don t keep doing it pause dur short you see i i think my mother is has been saying lately erm pause dur short things that she s finding it she s actually finding that her legs aren t very happy just going from the car to the supermarket and i think it s cos she doesn t do enough walking
1	yep
1	whereas my auntie anon nametype f type name which was my dad s sister is much more like your anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	she s older than my mum and she had she definitely wouldn t go out in snow because she had a bad fall a few years ago pause dur short just going she lives in sheltered housing
1	mm mm
1	and she was just going from the community centre to back to her little bungalow
1	oh right yeah
1	erm and went down and broke her wrist and her ankle and it was her right wrist and she s right handed and
1	ah
1	and was in and it has got and when i say broke i mean smithereen kind of broke they had to really pin the ankle unclear up unclear and so on
1	yeah right
1	erm and therefore she still although she can now use her hand things like cutting up steak are a little bit tricky
1	yeah
1	she hasn t got the full strength back in it and so
1	right right
1	erm but she s got one of those like a zimmer but on wheels
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	so she can yeah i think it what you were talking about and she insists on going into into skipton from where she lives which is pause dur short she used to walk it pause dur short quite comfortably and i think she s still doing it with this trolley
1	mm
1	and then getting the bus back cos it s up it s slightly uphill from the unclear
1	okay right fair enough yeah good compromise
1	but again the bus that they had which was one with the that was designed for old people
1	mm
1	and had a really good driver who you know they bloody cancelled
1	yeah
1	so now the bus is coming round at a less convenient time for shopping and it s it doesn t have the the step at the right height
1	right
1	so luckily there s a really nice driver who gets off
1	who jumps out
1	and helps her on with her unclear trolley unclear
1	right yeah
1	but otherwise she wouldn t be able to get into the er shop how s and it s
1	yeah
1	that that bus was full of old people a lot of people just stopped going into town because they can t
1	yes yeah yeah yeah that that s that s pause dur short that s
1	but she s got a tame taxi driver
1	uhu
1	er whenever she s going a little bit further afield she just rings him up and says right vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm
1	yeah
1	you know and and she s got various allowances and so on because she and and i don t think she s got a lot in the way of savings or anything they ran a shop you know i wouldn t have thought they managed to put a lot away erm and she just thinks it makes sense to use that money on things like like paying for a taxi from time to time to make her life a bit more interesting
1	absolutely absolutely
1	and i just contrast that with my mum who just who just vocal desc sigh er has let her life get narrower and narrower and i know it kind of had to happen when my dad was ill pause dur short cos she couldn t leave him
1	mm
1	and even when she could leave him she felt guilty about doing so you know and er but pause dur short most pause dur short of the widows that i know pause dur short sorry vocal desc laugh
1	yeah yeah
1	have sort of blossomed after their husbands died
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	and my mother was the opposite
1	right right mm
1	i mean even someone like someone called anon nametype f type name that she worked with that they sort of shared a class as it were that anon nametype f type name did three days a week and my mum did two and a half and they so they overlapped by half a day pause dur short for quite a few years and and her husband i think it was a heart attack but he died pause dur short really young you you know
1	mm
1	forties perhaps trunc cer trunc
1	oh right yeah
1	certainly not more than fifties so a long time ago she s now found somebody else i mean she s spent a long time mourning
1	mm
1	you know and i think being quite lonely
1	yeah
1	er but er pause dur short she s now with somebody else so
1	ah
1	which is really nice
1	right great
1	not that i would have expected my mother to go and find somebody else but it would have been nice if she d taken advantage of things like the theatre
1	yes
1	has a whole lot of women of a certain age involved
1	vocal desc laugh
1	some of them are widows some of them are not but they just they like doing things
1	right
1	without their husbands from time to trunc ti trunc
1	right right
1	and so there is a kind of little social group there that she could do things with and they kept inviting her and and she just oh no i don t feel like it
1	oh i don t yeah yeah
1	erm and and now it s oh well i don t think i can leave anon nametype m type name well you know yes you can
1	yes you can yes pause dur short yeah
1	but there are times when she ll only come out for coffee not lunch because she doesn t want to leave him event desc sound of doorbell well i m sorry that s my doorbell could be a parcel pause dur long
1	hi
1	hello hi anon nametype m type name thank you vocal desc laugh
1	there you go thanks very much unclear goodbye unclear pause dur long
1	yes
1	is this flour
1	sorry
1	is this flour
1	no no no it s a it s a i ve got i ve ordered two different things online from amazon
1	right
1	and both of them are potentially small enough to go through the letterbox but it depends how they re packed and i didn t know how they were gonna be packed pause dur short erm one is this erm unclear zantham unclear gum that i need for for the gluten free
1	right
1	erm so pause dur short i i don t know if you d seen i left a little note on the door saying erm if i m not in and it won t go through the letterbox can you leave it in the storage bin round behind the dustbins
1	right
1	cos it s totally out of sight there
1	right
1	it s waterproof
1	right
1	and i don t want to have to go right into pause dur short there used to be a parcels office in anon type place
1	ah but now
1	and now there isn t
1	right
1	erm and it s just such a nuisance and it s a good job that i did that i was in actually because it wouldn t it should have been able to go through the letterbox but they d packed it square rather than flat if you see what i mean
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so it would you know barclaycard why do we get pause dur short look at that weight of paper
1	yeah
1	what a waste and that ditto but at least that is i mean why barclaycard think i want a barclaycard i ve no idea i ve never you know it s not my bank
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm at least this is from a company that i have ordered things from but it s the second thing i ve had from them in a week
1	yeah yes
1	erm and every time i it s the plant company so it s like i ordered a lot of those plants from them erm but every time you do an order with them you get a free gift that you don t want erm pause dur short last time it was er it s down it s by the shoe cupboard in the hall a little backpack well i ve got a backpack and if i want another one i want one that has all those compartments like
1	mm mm
1	the current one because i take it to work and i need to be able to put different things in different places and and it s actually quite difficult to find one with all those compartments
1	yeah uhu
1	so i m not just going to accept any random backpack that s just got one compartment
1	right
1	it s of no use whatsoever
1	right right right
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i think having said that my kitchen scissors were from them
1	uhu
1	one time i some kitchen scissors and a set of knives
1	ah
1	er which event desc sound of phone pause dur short is that my phone
1	was a peep
1	yeah pause dur short oh the answerphone ll pick up pause dur short that is the loudest i can put it on and it s really not
1	no
1	very loud i don t think
1	no
1	erm i mean pause dur short this
1	that was that was it ringing
1	and it s only there
1	yeah
1	yes
1	right
1	erm and with with this new phone there s a base unit and a handset so i can and i do i mean unclear it s not very useful in there because we re not in there at the moment but unclear obviously unclear i did that yesterday trunc inc trunc when i was in there before you arrived
1	mm yeah
1	thinking if your were trunc c trunc held up you would ring and i would need to be able to hear it
1	right right
1	erm pause dur short but there s no way before that it or if i just if i if i leave the handset with the base unit they re in the office pause dur short i can probably hear it in the living room with the door shut but i don t think i would hear it in any other room of the house
1	mm
1	erm i mean obviously that s why you have a detachable handset so you can put it in whatever room you re in but then you ve got to remember to do it
1	yes
1	erm
1	yeah yeah
1	that s not pause dur short and i find with that that sometimes it s a bit like a mobile phone that sometimes there s a bit of a sort of echo on it it s not as
1	oh
1	as brilliant as
1	uhu
1	erm pause dur short it s not as good as the old phone except that the old phone didn t detach you know cos it was a
1	mm mm
1	erm i can t remember what actually went wrong with the old phone something did pause dur long plus i mean in a way i wasn t too bothered about having a to replace it because it was actually a fax pause dur short machine
1	vocal desc laugh okay
1	i bought it when i first came back to this country cos i d had a fax machine in japan which was really quite good for keeping in touch with mum
1	mm mm
1	cos they had one at that point
1	uhu
1	erm pause dur short and then i got that job er with the anon type place in anon type place where i was actually involved with it all year round but that it was only running in the summer so i needed to be able to communicate and this must just it must just have been pause dur short before everybody was doing emails so i mean obviously emails existed
1	yes
1	but it wasn t as widespread
1	right
1	and a lot of offices were still using faxes
1	yeah
1	and they actually offered to buy me a fax machine erm and pause dur short i don t trunc th trunc i don t think they did i mean i think i paid for it in fact cos i it was it was my main phone
1	mm
1	you know pause dur short erm pause dur short but obviously that meant it took up quite a bit of space on the desk and periodically i would still get unsolicited faxes from people who offering to collect my debts for me and things like that because they assume anyone with a fax machine is a business
1	a business yes yeah yeah
1	vocal desc laugh erm and at the other house pause dur short because the trunc per trunc people that i bought the house from had been running a business he built kitchens
1	okay
1	and pause dur short that number was the company number they had a different line for personal things
1	ah
1	i when i first moved in and i just had a phone with no answerphone and no nothing i was getting faxes coming through in the middle of the night you know which obviously couldn t come through
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	but you ve picked the phone the phone would ring and i have no means of switching of doing anything with it because it i didn t have an answerphone yet
1	yeah yeah
1	and i pick it up and all i was getting was this bloody beeping noise
1	yeah yeah
1	and i ended up having to unplug the phone every night and it was so annoying
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm
1	yes yes
1	so it was actually quite useful to to get a fax machine so it could actually cope with the faxes that were still coming for somebody else vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but er i don t i think that s kind of tailed off now pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	and have you had any contact with the old house with people in unclear
1	no not at all no er i left the new address pause dur short erm and but i but with a note well i mean i sort of left a pause dur short something telling them a few things about how to use things in the house
1	yeah
1	because i wasn t doing a i wasn t there when they moved in
1	mm
1	erm they were just getting the key from the agent and i was at work so we weren t actually talking and i ve never actually met them because the agent showed them round the house
1	vocal desc laugh you ve never met them
1	vocal desc laugh no
1	oh right vocal desc laugh
1	erm pause dur short no they they cos the agent that i moved to they did viewings themselves on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays or something like that and so the only i showed a couple of people round who could only do sunday
1	mm mm
1	but anybody who could do those days the agents did it was much i it was so much less stress with the second agent
1	mm mm
1	erm and that s partly why you know that i just
1	yeah
1	so they didn t even tell me that someone had been viewing until pause dur short afterwards erm pause dur short so yeah i d never met these people
1	oh
1	erm so as i said i left them a sort of a piece of paper that was saying this key s for that one this key s for that one
1	yeah yeah
1	and erm you know you need to do x y and z with a thermostat that sort of you know little things like that
1	right right
1	that i would have said if we d have been able to do a handover pause dur short left my address but said as far as i know i ve given the new address to everybody who needs it so any mail that comes for me is probably junk
1	mm
1	but use your judgement about that pause dur short nothing has been forwarded at all so
1	nothing mm
1	i didn t bother to ask the post office to forward stuff because most of the mail i get is junk
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm and what s the point
1	yeah
1	in forwarding that
1	yeah
1	as i say i thought i told everyone as it turned out i d forgotten the doctor
1	uhu
1	as i realised when i went to the doctor s
1	yeah
1	but i have i mean banks and and utility bills
1	yeah yeah
1	and all of those well i don t get those in the post anyway but erm i i had told everybody so pause dur short erm pause dur short but i used to even after ten years very very occasionally i would get mailing for the people who lived in my old house it is ridiculous that people don t just get things off their databases
1	yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur short you know things that were obviously junk pause dur short and you just think this is mad
1	yeah
1	but i think i think it s wasteful enough to send stuff like this out in the first place but
1	yeah
1	erm to keep on sending it after ten years vocal desc laugh
1	right right
1	without just checking that people are still there vocal desc laugh pause dur short er i mean the house could have been pulled down in that time couldn t it anything could happen
1	vocal desc laugh sure yeah indeed pause dur short indeed
1	yeah so my my spy anon nametype f type name pause dur short who lives in the house behind
1	oh right right
1	unclear my old unclear house you know tells me that they ve pause dur short changed the kitchen you know the the you remember my kitchen had that bar down
1	yeah yeah
1	that counter in the middle
1	yeah
1	that they ve pulled that up and and made it all into one big room
1	okay
1	well i can understand that actually because i loved that whole layout and everything and it was great if you were cooking
1	mm
1	people could be sitting at the table and you could be sitting at the table and you could put the food on the counter
1	yep yep yep yep
1	and everything but the dining area was a bit small
1	yeah a bit yeah
1	erm so that s fine if you had two people there and you can manage with four but but the person who went round the far side couldn t get up and go to the loo in the middle of a meal very easily
1	mm well okay yeah
1	erm but if you had any more people than that there it wouldn t have been possible
1	yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur short and you know this is a young couple who possibly are entertaining and i ve no idea what their families are like and so on so
1	right
1	i can understand why they would decide to do that
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but i think she s been a from her kitchen she can see into their kitchen which is a bit naughty really she shouldn t be doing that but
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm she s seen workmen coming and going and sort of pause dur short what s gone on and i gather they want to turn the garden into a more of a vegetable garden
1	oh pause dur short well fair enough
1	yeah i think it s a i kept that square of lawn because i think it s quite nice to have a bit of lawn
1	oh i would agree i i think a bit of lawn trunc i trunc is a good idea but i pause dur short if they re really into growing as much of their own as they can then
1	well i presume that s one reason why they bought the house a lot of houses have have houses at that sort of price probably didn t have much in the way of garden
1	mm
1	and there was enough there to do something with it it s one of the reasons i bought it
1	yeah
1	erm but when i moved in there were three lawns that the front bit where the roses are
1	mm
1	was a lawn and i dug that up
1	oh okay
1	and the side bed was a lawn
1	oh okay
1	and pause dur short that was a real really difficult to to mow because it was slightly below the level of the concrete path and so when you got to the edge pause dur short you you couldn t really do the edge of the lawn like you know
1	understood pause dur short understood yeah yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur short and i didn t see any point in having just lawn there because you weren t ever trunc go trunc going to sit on it or anything
1	no
1	it was in shade all day
1	yeah yeah
1	so i just er dug that up as well and and found some shade loving bushes which were relatively little trouble vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	but er no i wouldn t have wanted to have none
1	no no i well as i say i i agree with you but i can see if they really wanted to maximise for growing your own then fair enough
1	mm yeah yes cos you couldn t really do that in the front cos with those terrace well i suppose you could if you had it reterraced some a bit more manageably
1	you probably could but yeah
1	yeah
1	tricky
1	but so it ll be interesting to see how they re getting on with the people who moved into not the other half of my house but next door and over the fence
1	uhu
1	were a young couple who d only been in about a year and they d done a lot
1	uhu
1	to the house really a lot you know i mean erm not just new kitchen all new windows and doors and then then they were doing all sorts of things with the garden because pause dur short where my front garden was terraced that one was just a slope
1	mm mm
1	which was quite dodgy to work on i would have thought
1	yeah
1	i don t know why anon nametype f type name had left it like that because she was trunc qu trunc was well into her sixties by the time she moved she came to this area and she was up here for pause dur short five or six years i would say before she died
1	mm
1	which is just before i moved here you know
1	mm yeah
1	erm and she was pottering about weeding she really kept up with the garden god did she keep up with the garden
1	yeah
1	she was never out of it you know vocal desc laugh
1	oh right vocal desc laugh right
1	erm and i would just have thought it was she she would have felt unsafe on a slope like that
1	mm
1	but obviously not erm but they d actually had it terraced
1	they have okay
1	well had it done it with help because they were young and fit you know
1	mm mm mm hm pause dur short and the dog is still next is it as far as you know
1	i trunc th trunc no i don t well their house had finally sold it was also for sale
1	oh it had pause dur short oh yeah yeah
1	it had been for sale longer than mine
1	yeah
1	erm so whether they d moved out or not i m not sure pause dur short erm pause dur short now you d have thought i d have that conversation with anon nametype f type name the last time i saw her but that is a while ago i need to call on her again
1	vocal desc laugh mm get the latest gossip
1	well partly pause dur short she was one of those people we d chat over the wall and sometimes it would go on a bit long and you d think i want to go back in the house now
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but she was very kind and she was a good neighbour to have
1	mm
1	she watched out
1	right
1	you know and if she d seen something going on that shouldn t be going on she d have called the police you know
1	yeah
1	erm and indeed the guy in the other half of her trunc hou trunc what is a couple i didn t i knew the bloke better
1	mm mm
1	and sort of one time when i was cutting my apple tree down i was making a bit of a meal of it cos i had rather an old saw and he called over do you want me to come and do it for you and i said no trunc thank trunc well do you want me to lend you a saw vocal desc laugh yes i well i wouldn t mind that actually
1	well vocal desc laugh yes you re right
1	this one s a bit ancient
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm which he did vocal desc laugh er and things like that you know
1	mm
1	and and and he there was one day when i d been you know i was going back to check the house pause dur short i d been in and i must have opened a window and and left it open and
1	uhu
1	then we re off of course for a few days and and he d rung the estate agent to tell them that there was a window open
1	oh right good
1	erm so you know they were really
1	that s nice
1	they were good people
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but anon nametype f type name s husband died of parkinson s pause dur short oh three or four years ago now
1	mm mm
1	erm and they d been married for fifty seven years
1	vocal desc laugh
1	er and don t have kids so
1	mm
1	you know i think she s a little bit lonely
1	yes yeah
1	so i do feel i should keep in touch and i ve i ve called round a couple of times and i brought her up here to see the house
1	oh that s nice yeah
1	er you know obviously she didn t have transport so i went and fetched her
1	yeah
1	but that s quite a while ago now and you know it s it s just time just goes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and and probably for her it s not just going you know she i i doubt if she has enough to do
1	dragging around the yes
1	yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short trying to don t know i see my my auntie anon nametype f type name not like that at all she s got a million things that she does and you ring her up and say how are you fixed next week can i come over for lunch one day and it s well i m doing so i ve got monday club on monday and i m doing so and so on tuesday and i might just be able to squeeze you in on thursday vocal desc laugh
1	and actually last time i was supposed to go over pause dur short ah it was bank holiday monday so it s not actually that long ago
1	right
1	i d rung her up the week before and said i suddenly realised that it was a bank holiday monday i d completely forgotten about it pause dur short do you happen to be free well if we did something in the morning yes cos it s trunc some trunc she does something on a monday afternoon right so i was gonna go out for coffee and then she rang me up on the sunday to say could we make it lunch rather than coffee because she was taking some antibiotics that have to be taken an hour before a meal and pause dur short it just fitted in better with the way she did things
1	right okay okay
1	which pause dur short i said yes and then after i d come off the phone i thought oh because that means it s the whole day rather than the morning
1	mm
1	kind of thing if you go in as far as anon type place from here and she was wanting to have lunch at twelve o clock which is way early for me pause dur short and in any case i m just having so many problems eating that i really didn t put particularly want to do it
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	er the coffee had been much a better suggestion and in the end i rang her up on the monday morning to say look pause dur short i ve had a bad night with my indigestion which i had erm and i just think it s not a good idea sorry and she said right well i ve ordered a taxi i m going to go anyway vocal desc laugh that s my auntie anon nametype f type name for you i i unclear for my lunch on my own because
1	vocal desc laugh nice to hell with it yes
1	yes vocal desc laugh erm so you and so i don t feel even though i don t see her that often and and well i mean she s got two sons anyway you know
1	yeah
1	erm but i don t feel guilty about that i go and see her because i like to talk to her
1	yes yes yes
1	she s you know pause dur short erm pause dur short but er pause dur short mm pause dur short so
1	so
1	have you finished or have you
1	i have definitely
1	you don t want another thing of coffee or anything
1	no i m fine i don t trunc th trunc nothing more
1	oh right erm
1	so the jobs i know about are pause dur short tall man in bathroom
1	vocal desc laugh
1	er pause dur short the unclear hut unclear floor and the strimmer
1	yes
1	and the compost area
1	yes i think that s probably enough don t you erm
1	a good opening bid as you may say
1	mm yes pause dur short something else that i d forgotten about until we were sitting in there last night
1	oh sorry and possibly go and buy or carrying some
1	well yes but that s kind of to do with the compost isn t it
1	some concrete yep yep
1	erm is i know this sounds really the the living room window sill has got a sort of nasty plastic veneer on it pause dur short which i think looks horrible and i m assuming that you can t because it s shiny that you can t just paint it white because it wouldn t take the paint
1	okay
1	so i started removing it and i got part of it off and then the rest of it is so bloody well glued that i can t get it off so i could actually do with some help with that but that s not exactly it s been sitting like that for a year literally so vocal desc laugh it s not unclear urgent unclear erm so if we ve got time we can
1	we can certainly unclear
1	that was on my list but
1	put that on the erm pause dur short er provisional list
1	so erm so i think it would make sense to look at that er bathroom thing first
1	i would say
1	and then
1	one two three four
1	yes i would say that
1	okay
1	erm so
1	so tell me what happened with your er your car
1	well i i left erm the supermarket and went to try and get some bits that i d er couldn t couldn t buy at anon type place
1	mm
1	chestnuts and things so i drove down to a little supermarket down in
1	can i make some tea
1	mm in the old village
1	yeah
1	and vocal desc laugh i parked the car and i saw an old student of mine anon nametype f type name who well she s just an amazing girl anyway she runs erm anon type place and she s in a big choir and she s been running it for about ten years and i i was first to go just before christmas and take anon nametype m type name to see it anyway anon nametype m type name was ill but she was telling me about it but she s now been invited to er or asked to to take her gospel choir to anon type place for a big charity show and she was really excited about it someone very famous has asked her but yeah so she was telling me all about that we sat in my car vocal desc laugh and and i obviously run the battery down somehow and of course when we left i went and got my shopping came back and my car wouldn t start
1	oh has that happened before
1	and it has happened once before yeah but it was when the battery needed replacing anyway i
1	maybe it well when was the last time you had it replaced
1	about a year ago so it s not not old no no
1	oh it shouldn t shouldn t really
1	anyway erm i phoned anon nametype m type name and left a desperate message i don t know if you re there but on the answerphone you know left a desperate message saying oh you know my car s not starting anyway i phoned anon nametype m type name and he came over bless his little heart in his car
1	yeah
1	and tried it and he didn t have any luck and then i happened to see a garage the door slightly open and they re trunc cl trunc they re closed for until january but anyway i went running over and he came over and jump started it for me they got the car going drove home parked outside and then got well got my bag and we went off to anon type place because that s where anon nametype m type name works so he was able to in anon type place he was able to put the machine on and check that it was the alternator battery erm and something else but anyway he said the battery was good so it had just run down low and erm wouldn t start
1	but have you used it the last few days
1	i have yeah i use it all the time but it had drained it obviously it was only a small battery i presume a small car but anyway yeah trunc f trunc but so we went hurtling down there with his his erm pass and he went in and got the machine and put it on and sorted it out for me and do you want to put some more water in that
1	no i m alright
1	are you sure
1	yeah sure
1	a bit short yeah so i i got that going he got it going for me and erm i you know drove around a bit and came back by which time anon nametype m type name was home
1	yeah
1	and erm i said to him well this is where cos i then i thought if he hears that answerphone message come back and hears it he ll go and look for me down in anon type place old village which is where i where i was initially but no fortunately he had only just come in vocal desc laugh and he said well you don t need me then and i said no it s alright vocal desc laugh anon nametype m type name come to my rescue bless his heart and he was really good he went in got his machine out and just dislodged the battery and er and checked it all and put the machine on and that s it
1	oh
1	yeah so i got it going and i just said to him you ve just saved me sixty pounds cos if it had been us we d have gone to get a new battery
1	yeah
1	and put it straight in but because he d checked it and said the battery s good just run down but you know what i had my phone charger plugged in not charging my phone but whether that sort of takes the battery hi are you off darling

1	well anon nametype f type name still lives there in anon type place and it s always the coldest spot in the country i think they re really really cold all the time there even on a good day it s cold but anon nametype m type name reckons that it s about ten degrees nearly always throughout the year ten degrees colder there than it is here
1	really
1	yeah cos he watches the temperatures
1	yeah
1	in anon type place to see what we re basking in while he s free of him but no it s always quite cold up there in comparison several degrees difference at least but they erm get by he erm i don t know how they survive one winter a couple of winters ago he he s got quite a big driveway unclear

1	yeah
1	and he broke his ribs and he was really ill for ages he couldn t work erm but his girls how they get about i don t know it s really they get really thick snow up there
1	it s supposed to be fine like this again tomorrow
1	sunny
1	yeah
1	sunny but cold
1	well i suppose i suppose anon nametype m type name got two erm er barometers in his er living room and er it was very high high pressure but they re starting to fall now so
1	mm yeah
1	i think we re gonna get some rain unclear
1	well out there it s always cold we we ve got a barometer out there
1	oh have you
1	yeah just to see what it is but that that s almost like a fridge so i keep my you know food food like potatoes and stuff and vegetables out there like having it in a fridge vocal desc laugh almost good enough to keep your wine in but not quite
1	yeah
1	alright has he gone i said i would buy him petrol help to buy him some next time erm
1	yeah i ve been trying to get er some information about er
1	pensions
1	topping up my pensions and it s crazy er i i got er this number from this form er this letter they sent me which is and then then they said no you need to phone the national number so i phoned the national number and they said no you need to phone the local number
1	oh
1	so i get the local number and then they say you need to phone er the hmrc her majesty s er
1	yeah whatever
1	records and customs unclear or something like that
1	yeah
1	and that s when i phoned them and then they said no you ve got to phone the advice centre which is the trunc s trunc
1	where you d been
1	where i d been and they they sent me said oh you ve got to go and phone this trunc nu trunc i said i phoned it already and i m just going round in circles
1	mm so what was the outcome
1	well nothing i couldn t get any information so
1	your best bet
1	she she said try your local pension centre and that must be in anon type place i should think
1	probably mm your best bet is to send a letter to them all the same letter to them all with with you know a a reference on it
1	yeah well it s useless doing this i mean it takes so long
1	mm and what do you do you think you can do it then did you ask them that
1	well yeah yeah if i haven t contributed for the last six years
1	mm
1	which i haven t then you can
1	you can buy it
1	yeah
1	buy back in
1	yeah and anon nametype m type name says it s worth it because
1	definitely
1	yeah
1	well yeah because it s long term isn t it
1	yeah
1	definitely i did i told you that when you were home that i bought in some for my teacher s pension i bought in four years that i d missed paying to to erm and from from point of view my college had to pay as well so it was a really worthwhile
1	are there any pies left
1	what
1	mince pies left
1	mm over there they re in the thing at the back
1	so er yeah i ve i ll i ll do that tomorrow but tomorrow i ve got to go to the er citizens advice bureau
1	you didn t go there today
1	yeah i did they open at quarter past nine i got there at half past nine and they said erm oh i m sorry we re full up today you ll have to come back tomorrow
1	that s when people queue outside
1	you you start queuing at half past eight
1	yeah you do if you wanna be seen you have to be in there in the queue at least by half past eight i think it s crazy
1	mm and i ve got to get up about seven o clock tomorrow
1	vocal desc laugh oh my god crazy
1	mm
1	yeah so are they open every day then
1	every week day yeah
1	yeah well i imagine at this time of year it s particularly busy is it oh they re queuing because as you go in you get a number do you or something
1	i ve got no idea
1	no
1	may be maybe they you have to come back and they give you an appointment for that day
1	well i i i think you get erm a consultation or something
1	mm
1	you queue up you go in and obviously they give you some sort of numbering system
1	mm
1	erm so you trunc g trunc you get seen in turn but it doesn t hold many in there erm and then you get a consultation and they ll find out what your problem is and then probably erm send you off for help you know that s more specialised help i imagine that s how it all works
1	so if i do that in the morning and then if and when i get that sorted and i need to go down to erm anon type place i suppose
1	yeah
1	the pension place
1	mm
1	anon type place
1	well well look it up on the internet and find out exactly where it is but i imagine it is because that s er i think that s where the kind of job centre is isn t it in anon type place
1	unbelievable the way they just pass you oh so you have to phone so and so
1	mm i know i know these these erm government offices are always the same aren t they they have erm i don t know different areas i suppose that deal with different things
1	mm
1	so where was your tax office then when you were here
1	i ve got no idea
1	mm no paperwork dating back you can actually ask well you ve got you ve had a prediction for your pension
1	mm
1	but you can ask for erm a printout of all the stamps you ve paid
1	i have
1	while you were here and you ve got that have you
1	mm
1	oh right okay
1	yeah i did that erm last year
1	mm so then could you then not that very office that that came from you ve got a headed notepaper
1	yeah but it s not in anon type place
1	no but that s what i mean send a letter
1	well i could do
1	or you might even be able to email if you get into the right erm you know the right area you know the right address and the right thing you could try emailing them
1	mm
1	and that way it goes direct
1	right and you can t unclear
1	yes often you can t unclear
1	mm
1	is that the letter not the letter connected to it no
1	no this is just a a letter they sent me about a trunc qu trunc query a query they had
1	mm
1	but erm there s no email address
1	no

1	yeah
1	anon nametype m type name was out for quite a while he went off to pay some bills and do some running around so he didn t get back and i was stuck over in the thing and with a boot full of shopping it should have been in the fridge but mind you the boot was freezing it was freezing out so but i d got all this food that i should be cooking and i wanted to come back and do the cooking but i spent ages chatting to anon nametype f type name who is lovely she s a lovely girl she really is she was one of the funniest students that i ve ever taught i used to go into the room to try and teach them theory and she just would i don t know cause an uproar with laughter was always one of the and i used to say you know i ll never get you through your exams stop talking stop laughing you know joking and stop making me laugh and she said i promise we ll all get through our exams and they did but they were just a bundle of fun a bundle of fun and interestingly she ran this thing on erm in december that i was going to see this gospel she she runs a erm a what they call a performance choir and then a workshop choir and they have like a hundred and fifty people join well in all and they joined the performance choir and they trained for six weeks and put on a show every twice a year she does it and erm she is just the most amazing she s got always has these incredible ideas of new new things to introduce in her show but anon nametype f type name when she was young when she was at college sixteen seventeen she used to sing in the anon type place do you know the did you know the anon type place
1	no
1	no in the do you remember anon type place
1	no
1	in the in the anon type place anyway it was on on there it was a really popular bar i mean she wasn t old enough to drink or anything but she used to go and sing there and she was really
1	mm
1	really popular people used to go oh come on anon nametype f type name please sing tonight play the guitar she was really a very talented girl very talented and her mother became very ill she had erm some form of trunc de trunc trunc de trunc dementia i m not sure what quite sort not alzheimer s it wasn t straightforward some form of dementia and she looked after her for gave up everything and looked after her for about eight or nine years devoted her whole life to her she really sort of did everything for her and she always looked immaculate this lady she had her hair done her nails done lovely clothes on you know no matter what was wrong she anon nametype f type name made her she said just cos she s not well why should she you know be neglect her just leave her
1	mm
1	she was really really good she looked after her but when her dad who didn t wanna know i think he was just in denial of it all she gave up her whole life really and and did everything everything for her mum and her dad he s eighty something now but her mum when she died it was about two years ago was younger than anon nametype m type name and she d been ill for about eight or nine years i think prior to that so tragic really cos she s get well had no life and she s got so many talents so many and it seems very sad but she s lovely a lovely girl what she does now is because she she fought the social services and won
1	oh
1	which is almost unheard of erm because someone from the social services i think looking to cut down on costs that was what it was about said that her mother should not come out of bed it wasn t safe for them to get her out of bed and erm lift her up
1	yeah
1	well the result of that is that eventually she would die from lack of you know moving around and you know the with the organs i suppose go anyway anon nametype f type name said and and then the carers were forbidden to take her out of bed so consequently anon nametype f type name said right if you erm if this happened and she went above anyway to her bosses and said i ll sue if my mother dies i will sue and you you know it will be really serious erm publicity for you
1	mm
1	you know you know i ll do it nationally it won t be just local anyway eventually they changed their mind and gave back the package for looking after her and erm but when she trunc even trunc you know she kept going and even after her mother died and they all thought she d give up then erm and she didn t she just fought them and she won and she got an apology and they said to her what do you want then she said i want it never to happen to anyone else
1	mm
1	and erm anyway she did win and and did very well out of it but she now erm is an advocate for people who you know have got problems with their trunc o trunc elderly parents or family in hospital she she ll turn up and help them fight for what they want for that parent or or relative and she s such a worker so you know
1	anon nametype m type name s got a woman he goes to visit who s in hospital she s ninety
1	really
1	yeah and she is a trunc m trunc do you remember anon nametype m type name
1	anon nametype m type name i don t
1	anon nametype m type name
1	no not really
1	erm do you know up anon type place
1	mm
1	and next door erm there was a years ago there was a coffee shop a very small coffee shop

1	really
1	or replaced
1	removed
1	removed or replaced
1	oh i was gonna say
1	because apparently the skin the skin was growing over it erm it was the the flesh was forming around it or something so they
1	yeah
1	yeah and anon nametype m type name was convinced she she wasn t gonna survive
1	mm
1	and he thought he d he went up to see her and he what he thought for the was for the last time but she s she s still there
1	mm where is she in anon type place
1	i don t know i don t know where it is
1	anon nametype m type name got a pacemaker
1	yeah i know i know
1	and they i i d from what i can gather they can t ever take them out
1	mm
1	because the heart or the muscles will grow around it
1	mm that s right
1	and so you know you d rip vocal desc laugh holes into the heart wouldn t you so er
1	yeah but she s still there
1	oh bless her heart ninety
1	mm
1	that s going some isn t it
1	mm
1	really great yeah well what about anon nametype m type name then
1	he committed suicide
1	no
1	yeah
1	why
1	er well his personal situation wasn t great you know he was living in a council house somewhere and er i think you know it s just making ends meet and he unclear from what anon nametype m type name tells me he wasn t doing anymore music but erm i think that the the thing that really got to him well there are two things er the first thing was that erm was his daughter s wedding and they had it in i don t know a really posh anon type place hotel
1	oh right
1	erm the anon type place the anon type place or anon type place or something something like that and er she took him to buy some clothes and he wanted this suit and she said no that s er it s too much money you know you know get this
1	mm
1	and he wanted to try and you know look the part and she was scrimp trying to scrimp and scrape and begrudge him this and that and but the greatest er insult was that erm he wasn t allowed to walk her up the aisle
1	oh what
1	or or at the if it i don t know if it s a church or a civil reception anyway he wasn t allowed to give his daughter away
1	mm
1	and er then another snub came at the reception there was basically er two er groups there was the group where the the love is you know from the the sitcom
1	mm
1	and friends and family er from the other two families and er anon nametype m type name was er not asked to sit at the head table
1	oh that s stupid unclear isn t it
1	yeah i know i know yeah yeah and it really got to him and he he apparently he wrote to the anon type place er complaining about it and it was on the front page
1	really
1	yeah was anon nametype m type name saying and he really
1	it s sad isn t it
1	made a stink about it well it is yeah so
1	well it was embarrassing for him obviously
1	i mean er it is in direct contrast to you know the the daughter you said had trunc sac trunc sacrificed a life to look after her mother
1	well yeah
1	and you ve got the the unclear complete opposite of you know she how she
1	gone to her head unclear
1	treated her father
1	yeah lost to the groups
1	and erm he really got uptight and about this and erm when i came over for my sixtieth
1	mm
1	erm the er i i saw him it was in the summer of course and er he we met him anon nametype m type name and i met him at anon type place and we went into the teahouse there
1	oh i vaguely remember you going off to yeah
1	and er i think that s the very last time we saw him and erm yeah and he at that time he was er said he d got a young belgian girlfriend and was very happy with that but that fell through and i think that might have precipitated
1	mm
1	the last thing and he hung himself
1	oh god that s dreadful
1	and erm anon nametype m type name was very cut up about it he d had had a very er love incredible love hate relationship with him i mean they d had each other s women and wives and
1	what anon nametype m type name and
1	yeah
1	oh my god
1	you know he was with anon nametype f type name for years and years and years and years
1	i don t remember
1	er oh anyway he was and erm he split up from her and then anon nametype m type name came in and said he came into to live in the house and actually took anon nametype m type name s place in the bed vocal desc laugh and then anon nametype m type name went to sleep in the on the couch or something
1	oh my god
1	and this was anon nametype m type name s house ah oh it s
1	what
1	i know but he d done the same to he d had anon nametype m type name s one of anon nametype m type name ex girlfriends or
1	oh dear
1	but it s a very complicated relationship
1	oh my god
1	and erm they ve both er been good friends and good enemies as well sometimes
1	mm
1	but when he did do that he he felt very bad about it
1	oh my goodness me
1	i know
1	dodgy dodgy life that isn t it but i suppose the worse thing is you can t ever get over being rejected by your daughter though can you really
1	no unclear
1	it must have gone to her head i mean
1	well i mean especially if you ve got nobody else
1	mm absolutely yeah
1	and it s erm well i suppose he had his parents although his father is dead now
1	mm
1	but his his mother s still there
1	mm but it s not it s you know that your child you want them to be you know
1	i know i know it s but it s not uncommon is it you often hear about family feuds and you know somebody s not speaking to somebody else for years
1	yeah you do i mean everybody has yeah everybody has family problems but usually in that situation if he wasn t gonna be accepted as as unclear her father unclear he wouldn t have been invited to the wedding you know i mean would he i mean it s like it s almost worse to go to the wedding and not have your
1	mm
1	positionbe accepted and not to go to the wedding you know
1	yeah
1	very sad you know if you don t go you don t know what you re missing and what you yeah it s kind of like not you haven t got to face it but to have trunc th trunc that many snubs in one go you know the wrong suit and erm
1	mm

1	crazy
1	are spreading out towards anon type place and erm anon type place area and that s
1	well we we went to anon type place yesterday
1	mm it s a lovely little village

1	mm yeah the falklands
1	well she had lots of money i hope this never gets printed anywhere where she would hear had lots of money afterwards she sued the trunc f trunc the falkland island government which of course is ours and you know they admitted liability cos the oxygen flask er erm cylinder wasn t filled
1	oh
1	to the you know enough it wasn t full it was obviously not being checked someone had not done their job erm but i think it never made her happy she just she bought houses and put rooms in the roof or put extensions on and loads spent loads of money and then moved on to the next one she never settled never settled erm until basically the money had gone and then she got back down to normal to to reality and you know had to work and but she had a lot of money when she was young but it just couldn t buy her happiness and it couldn t what she was trying to do always was holiday and trying to compensate for what she d lost really and it you know you can t and er yeah it was very very sad and anon nametype m type name now twenty six the same age as anon nametype m type name just moved in on the twenty third moved in to his first flat on his own well with his girlfriend you know left home but but he s been living with anon nametype f type name for a number of years

1	no not at all i think it had run its course you know i d been there long enough and things were changing erm erm and i wasn t the last one of because there were four of us that worked together for not for the full twenty five years but two of us that worked for twenty five years there and one of them was one of my first groups of students and then another one that i d been at college with she didn t work there that long but there were four of us that knew each other and had came through roughly the same sort of background training and and work experience and erm so we worked together for twenty five years but one erm my friend that i worked the longest with she erm went she took a year out and went to work in anon type place and came back and took early retirement so she was the first one out and another one that i d been at college with anon nametype f type name she left to go and live in anon type place erm and then that left myself and anon nametype f type name that was my ex student and erm i had the opportunity if i didn t take early retirement then i d have to have committed to another five years and i couldn t face five more more years so i thought right i ll get out now to get my early retirement money
1	mm
1	and then i can do less hours and still take home the same and that s what i did and i erm i took the opportunity was literally just on they were trunc cha trunc just about to change it to say twenty five year you know to fifty five so i i managed to get it and my birthday was in the july and they were gonna start it in the september and i so i went yes i ll have it panicked a bit but i didn t as i walked away i felt nothing it was really strange i mean i d spent well if you think i was fifty i d spent twenty five years more time at work than at home don t you when you re five days a week you re home two days so i i was i couldn t understand why i felt that when i went to anon type place erm and it was very much more a relaxed regime and erm and i didn t work many hours to begin with and i just got ended up getting dragged in more and more but i felt more when i left there erm because i left for a year and went to work at anon type place and that was the weirdest experience working in anon type place it was a strange and bizarre year and they my head of department erm got to know that i wasn t very settled it was i found it yeah i i met some of the staff at a competition and someone said to me how is it going how are you enjoying working at anon type place and i went don t ask and she said why isn t it good i said well it s weird it s not right it s you know different and she went back and told my boss from anon type place and she sent a message i want to poach you back come back
1	vocal desc laugh

1	were they really
1	so they could do their lessons yeah and flipcharts and things and they were buying their own stuff cos they couldn t guarantee they d have it for their lessons
1	wow
1	but erm the college what happened was the college erm when the new principal took over she announced that they were erm i think she said four million in debt or two million in debt two million in debt and there would be redundancies some redundancies so she took over in the january and february and she announced this erm and then a few months later she she said erm actually we re not four million er two million in debt we re in four and it s much more serious than i initially thought and she immediately erm had the finance officer marched off the building and investigated
1	really
1	yeah and the principal was called in and the finance officer and they were interrogated and the finance officer got sacked with no pension
1	woah
1	and the principal well he d gone with his money so but i know what happened they they had a massive new state of the art building of one of the erm satellite centres in anon type place and i watched it being built cos anon nametype f type name was at college there erm and it you know oh i m having this place just two little extensions you know whatever your budget you start with you can double it and that s closer on what it would be but theirs probably was more cost it went over a long time and erm like you know you get your buildings are in a unclear they ll get them sorted but once you ve done that you ve got all the furnishings and the
1	mm
1	equipment and the materials that you need to set it all up and i think that s and it turned out to be ten million ten million in debt which means it triggers an immediate ofsted

0	yeah
0	just the gym and then just chilling and it s like pause dur short okay
0	with anon type place that s not hanging over him anymore
0	so it s like all like it s kind of like it s not changing for me
0	mm
0	i m not even that but

0	was she on twenty three
0	mm
0	yeah
0	is you know where it should start unclear with unclear
0	yeah
0	er something is well i think the trunc thi trunc the thing er the thing is now that i know that at least something is changing
0	yeah pause dur short the privacy unclear would be unclear so much better
0	the privacy d be nice especially like if anon nametype m type name came to stay and stuff like
0	yeah
0	cos there s someone always there just like wandering around outside and you re just like oh
0	exactly so
0	you know pause dur short i am not i am a people person
0	yeah
0	so it ll be quite interesting to see but it s not like i can t invite people round and be like unclear
0	everybody round like you know
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah but it was a kind of not one that we d had before but because you know things have been getting better in terms of communication cos he s not brilliant
0	so you know he s getting better but he s like anon nametype f type name it s actually through the things that i do that i show you that i care like
0	yeah
0	and i just need that a bit more cos it s like i m like if you say i look nice or you know
0	yeah
0	and i was just like well no offence but you re you re trunc l trunc literally should stop communicating like the reason like we didn t go anywhere was because
0	like the reason i pulled back and i never really let him in was
0	vocal desc laugh
0	like unclear you know i mean unclear girls er girls need to be told
0	because like and i think er what s confusing for girls is that for most girls the act of sex itself
0	mm
0	exactly
0	so if you need that verbal affirmation
0	as friends whereas when you re in a relationship it s like oh well how are we doing because you know everybody s automatic assumption about the job has been ah but you ll move in with anon nametype m type name i m like hell no
0	vocal desc laugh no
0	no not yours but i mean like other people who don t know me
0	as well and have just said oh yeah i m with anon nametype m type name and er you know
0	obviously i get to see him more and blah blah blah but no no
0	not right now
0	nine months vocal desc laugh
0	that was a rollercoaster unclear of a ride unclear that one vocal desc laugh
0	and er you know see how unclear things work out unclear cos it could be that pause dur short you know he moves in starts becoming a lad and becomes a completely different person don t think that would happen
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	unclear
0	oh yeah i don t i unclear rush it
0	he pause dur short yeah i like my space he adores his space sort of thing
0	and unclear
0	yeah i know but
0	the more you try and push them the more they ll just retreat pause dur short so
0	the people higher up in the unclear unclear i m like well unclear that s great erm and that s all happened while i ve been ill and
0	yeah
0	like it was like on wednesday i met up with some of the another person in the science team who d also kind of given me a few quick pointers
0	mm
0	definitely london
0	i think
0	like i said like i ve pretty much said to myself obviously it depends what jobs come up
0	there s nobody in there in
0	yeah
0	you know i d just deal with the gripes you know but i don t have to
0	there s no point doing something like that if you yeah if it s not necessary
0	that s the thing like it s so big and everyone s like oh you ll meet loads of people but because it s so big i actually think a lot of people get lonely because they don t know how to make friends
0	mm
0	well she s been passed over for promotion a lot of times and
0	shit
0	so it means that people who started three years after her
0	are above her
0	are above her
0	oh did he vocal desc laugh
0	nice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	no i know what you mean
0	unclear it is unclear pretty cool though if i met philip i d be i d be absolutely i d be so happy
0	vocal desc laugh something offensive unclear you d be like i love unclear you
0	unclear i know unclear
0	so he s like the head of the department
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	it ll be something really offensive and then she ll just be like mm it s like
0	vocal desc laugh
0	like today he trunc w trunc it completely came out of my mouth and it was really bad he was like we were talking about tornados and anon nametype m type name turned round and said yeah but tornados for some reason seem to always like go through the trailer parks and just destroy them i was like maybe there s a reason why
0	and he burst out laughing and unclear this other woman unclear was like why because you think the trailer trunc tra trunc like trailer trash should be like blown away i was like well yes that was that was the joke
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	unclear
0	also
0	what s with the i want to do inappropriate things to you hello there are much better ways of saying that kind of thing but
0	so will there be a round two and three of the after party
0	oh oh oh oh oh
0	unclear
0	i ve told him i don t want anything unclear
0	i think there was so much pressure on your on you two to be together
0	in the middle of training like over email and all this kind of
0	and they re blaming you
0	fuck off unclear
0	to be fair it s took everybody by surprise and there are reasons for this this this this this
0	and then anon nametype f type name came up to me today and was like just to give you the context of that and i was like that s fair enough but after everything that was going on i was like i really do not appreciate that
0	yeah
0	you ve got something to lose
0	that s the thing
0	unclear vocal desc sigh
0	is the moment the pressure happens because there s that pressure to keep it going
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm pause dur short so pause dur short yeah we re screwed aren t we
0	i m having a puppy
0	you have a puppy i ll have a kitten

0	unless it goes really well erm but also this might be the opportunity that i can move to australia branch so it s like you know if i make connections there is that
0	unclear yeah
0	i still would like to do psychology it s just so confusing there s just so much i wanna do and not enough money to do it unclear with unclear

0	i think it was quite late at night by the time we got to portland cos anon nametype f type name took us to that pizza place that sold pizza by the slice and was really really good
0	yeah
0	i mean i assume she didn t go there
0	we met up with them in iceland and erm
0	we did
0	did we say trunc good trunc did we say goodbye to anon nametype f type name and anon nametype m type name at boston or did they get on the bus to portland too

0	yeah i feel like they were slightly adventurous flavours i don t think i wrote that down i don t think i was recording what flavour pizza we had the night we landed we were just really tired and
0	i don t think we even took pictures of it or anything we were just knackered so
0	but
0	quite hard to find isn t it right back in the depths of your phone
0	yeah we trunc wa trunc walked up and down really anon nametype f type name i guess had work
0	in portland cos like the the b and b was insanely good with erm the breakfast was just like a tray of desserts and some fresh fruit vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	like cinnamon rolls and things just fresh out of the oven
0	cantaloupe melon every day
0	i think we did the great lost bear on our last day

0	it was
0	and it was really strange so yeah did we land in san francisco in like the wee hours of the morning or
0	was like two am or something
0	and we fell out because vocal desc laugh because i was really annoying that that happened
0	it was so annoying
0	and then
0	in fact yeah we got to that sort of strange motor inn on lombard street
0	oh yeah
0	and instead of just trying to sleep
0	oh
0	no they didn t seem that bothered did they they were like
0	but it was kind of a bummer to be like oh one of our cars all bust vocal desc laugh just like on the first day

0	uhu and i think we were pretty worn out by that point
0	they re quite unusual the buses they re
0	like yeah i think that s right
0	something like sierra nevada or something
0	vocal desc laugh
0	we were gonna go cycling the next day

0	mm
0	and then we drove oh
0	yeah
0	and so that that meant that our dinner that night was in that kind of roadside place that i had my first fish unclear tacos unclear and they were really good
0	highway one
0	there was quite a lot of sprawl
0	uhu yeah
0	what you hear about highway one with all the amazing views and the
0	yeah it s great i mean it was only just really the start of it but that was definitely when i i mean it was relaxing to know that the car was kind of fine
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but then it was just great to be on the road as well
0	must have been yeah which was great that was a really nice campground
0	yeah the sun was setting but everything was easy to find
0	yeah
0	yeah

0	place like unclear setting up unclear unclear things and art and not really very profit driven and stuff but i guess it s a bit hippy
0	yeah cos anon nametype f type name had loaded us up with her really quite vintage camping stuff which was dented and burned and
0	vocal desc laugh trunc ye trunc
0	conspicuously missing
0	monta a de oro

0	and you could see it highlighted
0	and it was like oh so st one is badger and badger is up there but not before we d already pitched in the wrong place and had people come and tell us we couldn t pitch there cos it was their pitch
0	vocal desc laugh and
0	it was it was a knackering cos it s a trunc hi trunc it was a hike to camp the campground wasn t it so you couldn t drive there
0	uhu
0	and the sun was going down as we were like
0	finally pitching in the right place and i was like

0	erm
0	but amoeba was great
0	and guided by voices mostly

0	yeah
0	er so it was like a trunc per trunc vocal desc laugh almost like a personal tour but
0	yeah while we were waiting and i erm and i was looking at all the artwork it it really hit me really hard
0	trunc ye trunc vocal desc sigh but trunc anyw trunc

0	yeah
0	yeah

0	it could be slightly earlier or slightly later but
0	no
0	trunc sor trunc and it was free
0	yeah and slab city nearby but it s like you know what if had to live in this heat i d probably be just about ready to kill anyone
0	it s too hot
0	yeah it s pretty rough
0	so we went back to palm springs still really hot but
0	well they had mechanisms for coping with it like every every
0	cold mists of watery air
0	yeah
0	yeah and
0	it was like er we did the mystery hotel thing so it was like
0	we didn t know where we were gonna stay
0	it cos almost nothing to stay there and it was really good vocal desc laugh yeah
0	and our room was literally by the pool
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	i felt like that s part of the reason it was a bit cooler like especially our hotel cos it was in like
0	royal sun inn yeah
0	yeah
0	such a party town my impression of it was definitely like party town for the retired vocal desc laugh
0	i d love to go back it was vocal desc laugh

0	little centre didn t it with a couple of clothes stores and a
0	yeah like kernville actually had stuff sorted out but i think it was like the unclear old the unclear place though unclear
0	and you could tell that they were suffering a bit with the drought because they were still fairly low
0	more than twice as full
0	that was one of the nicest hotels i think wasn t it that was really nice
0	it was really clean and quaint
0	yeah

0	vocal desc laugh with each other
0	we did spend quite a long time there actually vocal desc laugh
0	we did
0	yeah and what else did we do that day
0	that was great
0	that had the view over the valley with the river down the bottom

0	that we were just like you know what let s not try and do too much we ve got a nice place to chill out by the river we can just sit back
0	and catch our breath a bit

0	which would have been cool but and i managed to smash my phone jumping trunc o trunc on a rock
0	oh yeah that was really annoying
0	luckily i managed to fix it like the morning after in the mall
0	yeah i suppose at least that was one of the upsides to going out of a national park was that you could get that sort of thing sorted at the mall
0	i guess so
0	i think i remember you getting your mum some stuff
0	and my brother er but then we got the hell out of there and drove right through yosemite

0	thank you
0	look after it with love
0	i don t think that s going to be an option
0	it s just basically just a plain unclear one but pause dur short this goes round the middle but
0	they have like a final show pause dur short you go and look round and everyone gets all dressed up in suits and
0	so the silver silver slingbacks pause dur short mm pause dur short i just love it i just never find trunc anyth trunc anywhere to wear it with pause dur short the trunc con trunc the concern is now i m actually bit too old to wear this dress do you know what i mean
0	the pattern on it is very young yeah pause dur short but i mean it s
0	it s a very young print
0	it s the sort of thing you don t want to get rid of because it s you know because of the memories attached to it
0	mm
0	yeah
0	so for your birthday we might even be able to have a tea party
0	that would be my favouritist thing ever
0	it would be pretty fun
0	i think she would wear exactly like that
0	yep pause dur short i love i love the mad hatter s tea party pause dur short i played the mad hatter once in a play pause dur short it was great
0	we might have to
0	not just a tea party unclear
0	i don t know pause dur short and then she cos she said it s up in did she say chester so the petrol it s going to take her four hours to get there em
0	and then and that wasn t even including the dinner
0	oh was it
0	mm
0	right
0	oh
0	with like loads of embroidery all over it all the way round the edges covered covered covered in embroidery
0	mm hm
0	all down her arms to here pause dur short and it didn t look grannyish at all it looked lovely
0	it sounds nice pause dur short so she had it made did she
0	like she s quite she s a bit chubby but she s not pause dur short you wouldn t look at her and go god she s big
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah i do
0	we ll just sit down and work out logistics really but we could do it together because pause dur short she s saying that we have to fly realistically we should fly into belfast city rather than belfast international cos it s so much easier to go to the hotel pause dur short where we can get changed and then
0	cos i m sure she ll be fine with that pause dur short she s got space cos we ll just kip on the floor pause dur short it ll probably mean getting the tube at some sort of ridiculous hour
0	mm pause dur short but it s stupid o clock from london or stupid o clock from cambridge pause dur short so
0	mm
0	and that one s going to be to big and that one s just easy to carry
0	mm
0	getting nervous
0	mm
0	mm
0	em there s an exhibition at the design museum louboutin
0	mm
0	a retrospective exhibition
0	em and pictures and all sorts of stuff
0	oh wow pause dur short that sounds really fun
0	mm
0	mm
0	trunc h trunc well yeah pause dur short well he was kinda skirting around it so he doesn t obviously doesn t really want to go to the
0	which is fine
0	yeah
0	so what you do would you go down for the day do you think
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	mm
0	i think i think i said keep free
0	mm
0	but then he hasn t written it on the calendar pause dur short he hasn t written like keep free anon nametype m type name says keep free pause dur short so now he has no idea why he s keeping it free
0	mm
0	innit
0	but then it s all supposed to be that way isn t it like typically you don t stay this close with your ex boyfriend or girlfriends pause dur short so you don t say
0	yeah but then if you re seeing somebody else like you you don t know what you might be doing in april like you might be seeing somebody he might be more serious with anon nametype f type name like pause dur short you might have a a you know a group of people out that night say if we went on a girlie thing and he would definitely come and you and he would definitely be invited and you definitely would see each other but pause dur short like to actually just spend time just one on one pause dur short cos i ve got nothing to compare it to so to me it seems a bit pause dur short a little but strange but maybe it s not maybe it s completely normal just like it would be normal if you were all like best mates and you had never actually been in a relationship together
0	and he said em pause dur short and you know trunc na trunc you know i haven t been invited to anything so pause dur short and then he tried to have a dig at me as it was my fault
0	mm pause dur short he is a bit of a strange one isn t he
0	but you went it to this with your eyes open didn t you like pause dur short i remember you saying like you wanted to do this because you feel like it s going to help you move on pause dur short like it is going to be make or break like it s
0	ah
0	a little jolly pause dur short so what are you going to do on monday you re gonna go to hms belfast
0	yeah i don t know pause dur short i m really pissed off
0	i m going to make go the egg hunt pause dur short i ll print us off i ve printed off the maps at work they re in the car
0	mm
0	i said just have a look and we ll see what you want to do and we ll do we ll do it pause dur short so
0	yeah i think it s going to be a bit of a whistle stop tour
0	mm
0	mm
0	and then go and do the egg hunters you know a couple of hours
0	then do it pause dur short and then the next time you go to london do something else cos otherwise it s not pause dur short sort of pointless really
0	that s what i thought
0	oh yeah
0	and he s supposed to be like on the run now pause dur short em what is his name pass pause dur short and he had tiny grains of sand and each one of them was hand painted in the turbine hall pause dur short when you see the turbine hall you ll see how big it is and it each grain of sand was painted by chinese workers pause dur short and but they re painted like with lead and so health and safety came and took them all away because they said oh it s you know because people were going in and walking on them pause dur short so it s like walking on like westerners walking on the work of what people do in the east pause dur short so how much time and effort goes into work that they produce and pause dur short yeah it was quite it was quite a statement and but they took it all away and they said you couldn t go in
0	yeah pause dur short and you
0	yeah and you could go walk on it and then they said you couldn t walk on it and then they just took it all away pause dur short it s really sad
0	you could see how he d got there pause dur short mm
0	mm
0	what s cte
0	you know eh the french bistro thing there s one in cambridge
0	cte no i don t know
0	yeah c o t e with a little hat on the e
0	cos it used to be an american diner and you used to sit in like old nineteen fifties cars when we first moved to cambridge about four or five years ago pause dur short it s a proper american diner and i really trunc lik trunc i though it but cheesy as hell
0	but it was quite fun and obviously like playing elvis records all the time but i think it was an independent and it just closed down and then yeah
0	mm pause dur short there s two
0	yeah
0	but then it seems a shame to go to london and eat in the hotel

0	carbs on carbs with
0	yeah
0	and they re like the housekeepers need that stodge to keep them going cos they do a really physical job no they don t pause dur short nobody needs that
0	bollocks pause dur short no
0	mm pause dur short no pause dur short no no pause dur short there s absolutely no need for it pause dur short and you really should be you know supplying alternatives
0	but they just don t
0	all that shit
0	the gossip board pause dur short that s where i complained
0	oh you said went to the holiday inn yeah
0	it s it s trunc af trunc it s everything it s africa
0	it s everything it s africa pause dur short eh is it everything or is it africa
0	oxfam cafod water aid
0	save the children nspcc
0	cancer research
0	rnli
0	it helps loads of trunc peo trunc loads of different things
0	mm well that s good
0	all over the world
0	mm
0	yeah pause dur short but this other trunc char trunc because it does so much stuff pause dur short it helps fight aids in africa pause dur short it s malaria jabs it s children in india they re getting married off at eight years old and raped
0	no pause dur short frig pause dur short it s it s like it s really like amnesty international but and i think it s called community community oh
0	world is it like the world aid organisation or world or something mate you probably should know this
0	the thing is they ve probably have you this and you ve probably gone yeah it s interesting
0	no they haven t actually
0	i don t know if they ve told the management team but they certainly haven t told us yet
0	because that s well that s what you need to know isn t it otherwise there s no point
0	mm
0	yes to death pause dur short and the worst part is we have to send someone from the department and obviously no one volunteered to go but i can t do charity stuff pause dur short like i really can t
0	have i told you that i think africa is just like i can t even don t even know what s going on there
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	but we let it run wild out there because it s just not financially viable for us to do anything about it pause dur short it is disgusting and it is really far away but the worry is obviously what with television being everywhere in our lives is we are desensitized to everything
0	mm
0	trunc th trunc trunc i trunc it s perpetual because they shouldn t be living there
0	mm pause dur short mm
0	and really i can t i can t help but think right that if maybe if maybe no one was throwing money at it
0	trunc w trunc which is where the hitler comes in they would all be dead
0	mm
0	i just wish that maybe thousands of years ago hundreds of years ago when people started throwing money at the problem they didn t throw money at it so it never developed pause dur short do you know what i mean like i
0	i can t understand how it got to this now
0	i don t know pause dur short i mean my history is pretty bad as well pause dur short i don t know why pause dur short obviously we all come from africa pause dur short trunc even trunc like
0	through the last thousands of years as man s evolved we ve all come from africa pause dur short so trunc every trunc we are from them
0	so why it happened that you know obviously in the west we evolved more quickly we maybe it was because our terrain was much more habitable and we were able to do that pause dur short as as we evolved we then went to these countries and then enslaved them and we took religion and we took our culture and enforced it on these countries pause dur short so like for example when you go to new zealand and you learn about the maori culture and you learn about how they d had to come over from you know polynesian islands and they and and you know trunc in trunc invaded new zealand and the maoris had made it their own land pause dur short and when the whites came like the missionaries came they came and taught them religion pause dur short so they taught them that god had created the earth in seven days and on the seventh day he rested and the seventh day was a sacred day pause dur short so they laid down their weapons on the seventh day and they rested and the white man came and they brutally murdered them all pause dur short because they knew that they d lay down their weapons
0	fuck
0	the women are going to be raped the children are going to get killed and the men are gonna be enslaved pause dur short so it s all very well to say that we re the evolved western world when in actual fact we re less humane than anybody else
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	no
0	but no but no i don t think anybody is because they re just being left to their own devices pause dur short there s no one really there there s no one really there to help them
0	so when the woman says no don t do that
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	and obviously you ve got people in haiti you know and they re still in port au prince they re still living in shanty towns
0	well no that s and i think that s why people have such a have such difficulty in in relating to it because it is so far away pause dur short it s so far removed from what we understand but that s you know it s not a reason not to do something about it
0	i was the wrong person to send to the charity meeting pause dur short it was a fucking piss take
0	that is just really moving though isn t it i mean that i mean that that s why they do it
0	mm
0	the idea that someone is dying every three seconds unnecessarily
0	yeah like you saying it and i know you re not lying but it just sounds like a lie
0	and they all those advert the all the celebrities clicking every three seconds
0	that was it pause dur short that s another person dead pause dur short and it s really powerful but then as soon as that s gone everyone s forgotten about it because that s what you do you sort of go about your daily lives don t you
0	yeah
0	i m talking just take your interest out of what you had
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	they ll be a nuclear war and it ll be the fucking pharmaceutical companies who will survive pause dur short they re fucking devils pause dur short cos it s just
0	cos i thought that as well pause dur short so i said okay so you can t you can t make them wear condoms
0	so why don t they just give all the women the pill
0	you trunc tr trunc well i suppose you d try pause dur short i mean obviously you ve got
0	you do if you lived in a country where you re going to be raped

0	it s just so much more densely populated
0	mm

0	so that helped a little bit but
0	yeah
0	yeah so did i though
0	unclear mm unclear oh
0	so that more than covers her fees and she s got like a bit extra in the bank which is really good
0	just because she paid the higher fee rates and i think her your family income has to be so much and whatever it s worth looking into though
0	yeah just so expensive now you know
0	oh i know don t even talk about it pause dur short i know when i went to anon type place the fees were only like

0	mm
0	yeah
0	they said that they don t even read your application so you spend like so long on your personal statement and everything like that
0	i know well they justify it by saying that like they don t want to erm you know advantage students that come from like wealthier backgrounds but i don t understand unclear the trunc y trunc unclear
0	more privileged backgrounds will be able to get people to answer the questions vocal desc laugh for them you know
0	so cos i have quite a lot of experience i think but
0	yeah it shows how you like you really want it and stuff and what you can offer to the course doesn t it
0	oh i went to anon type place
0	erm yeah with erm me and anon nametype f type name got the train down because

0	oh er like just over a year so not that long yeah
0	so not long so yeah i feel like obviously i was with someone for seven years but i it annoys me when people are together for like six months and then jump into everything and then they wonder why it doesn t work out
0	but i mean i i trunc c trunc i i don t think there s like a one set time for everyone but unclear
0	yeah well it works out sometimes

0	so yeah
0	oh it s polite though to get something isn t it

0	mm
0	mum s fine like i ll get her skincare or something but dad i just he doesn t use anything like we got him this really expensive like eighty pound leather like bag for work and it d be really nice you know to take his work in and stuff
0	well i think yeah men are just a lot more practical aren t they
0	oh was it
0	did you send them it
0	unclear i wouldn t be like just in case like i was planning on spending twenty quid on unclear do you know what i mean
0	ten years so i think i
0	yeah
0	i was like oh thanks and then i think i sort of like just put it erm on like the side of the carpet
0	would you not know that she wrapped it for you
0	well i don t they were obviously more suited to a younger
0	it was awful
0	vocal desc laugh
0	my mum used to hate my nan s gifts it was so funny she used to give them to charity
0	she d just be like have you got the receipt vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	ah unclear
0	oh that s nice mm yeah
0	and then anyway a trunc f trunc a couple of months later i think they re building their own house or something so they were moving out of their other house
0	well yeah i think like they knew it was her like
0	you wouldn t do that though would you
0	why doesn t yeah she should just ask him and get er him to ask or
0	something i used to do all the shopping for anon nametype m type name s family
0	and i enjoyed it but like he just he just never did it so i was like fine i ll do it cos it s a joint thing anyway so i just did it anyway
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	i know i sent we sent them a christmas card to anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name so
0	yeah
0	ah
0	yeah yeah
0	i know that s why i insist on going away now because it was quite cold actually and we spent all that time
0	ah
0	mm
0	ah lovely
0	there was a snowstorm so like all the cars were covered up completely
0	yeah yeah anon nametype f type name
0	all the subways were covered in ice
0	yeah yeah yeah
0	yeah
0	for like four nights this year but obviously travel with like the whole isis thing isn t unclear great unclear
0	well yeah
0	yeah
0	they have like security scanners and
0	yeah
0	just before trunc chris trunc
0	does she not get really bored though
0	oh right
0	yeah
0	a bit creepy
0	yeah
0	you re such a little scaredy cat
0	i hate horror movies literally watched house of wax when i was like twelve
0	i just don t get how people can do that to other people it s horrible
0	mm
0	like you know like saw can t deal with that
0	but if it s just like i don t know pause dur short like the exorcist i found hilarious
0	yeah
0	oh right
0	thingy bridge
0	it s not like vocal desc sigh oh anon type place bridge
0	no it s before you get to anon type place
0	oh i don t know i m not sure pause dur short is do they have a nice house
0	do they just have the anon type place then or do they have any other
0	but that s doing well obviously as you know
0	i mean i don t know if we went in for dinner they d probably give us a discount i m sure
0	think it ll have to be when i move out because obviously the renting situation
0	so that s a shame
0	so did they say a definite no then
0	so i assume erm you know for the amount we re paying and like we re obviously really close like my mum buys them christmas presents
0	like they re really close like they they meet up and stuff because
0	yeah be a bit more laid back
0	i ll just get one myself
0	she s a lovely dog
0	i wasn t gonna pay but i i think pause dur short i dunno i d prefer to be close to the library
0	yeah it looks really
0	is it quite new the grad college
0	you know it s a couple of thousand pounds more in debt than i already am so it won t make much difference
0	to be honest i probably won t pay it back anyway
0	right
0	unclear if you see what i mean unclear
0	but you have to do unclear schemes and they re so competitive for like a two week placement you have to do the assessment centre and all that stuff
0	mm
0	yeah
0	then we graduate in september so i guess like over the summer i can start sort of applying for things
0	well if i did get one
0	like i d probably go for that instead of doing my masters
0	but yeah as soon as i started i got two interviews in like the same week
0	mm
0	it s just typical isn t it like you
0	did you not go no
0	i think they needed someone there and then really
0	where were where were they at then
0	yeah
0	oh right yeah would you move there then
0	yeah yeah
0	cos it s so much cheaper unclear commute to london vocal desc laugh
0	yeah so it s looking a bit more promising really
0	yeah but the doctorate is for your clinical or educational training
0	the train erm back will probably be delayed by a bit as well i think
0	i think it s just direct
0	trunc w trunc will we find out like when we get back on or unclear
0	is your mum okay to
0	that s fine i just didn t want it too late if it s delayed by lots it should be fine
0	yeah
0	er no he s got er oh no he s just handed in his dissertation for his er like fourth masters or whatever he s on
0	and then i think he s doing a trunc p trunc his phd i think it s occupational health and safety
0	so yeah
0	oh did he
0	yeah did you say hi
0	mm
0	i m really bad
0	yeah pause dur short i genuinely don t know what s wrong with my motivation i mean pause dur short i think my general motivation hit rock bottom a few months ago pause dur short and then i dunno i just i can t pause dur short get like i would like to start running again i just cannot make myself
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah
0	yeah but pause dur short just i dunno it just seems like a lot of money that isn t a necessity
0	erm
0	vocal desc laugh now i m the breadwinner vocal desc laugh
0	in front of the telly pause dur short i d be more likely to do it if you go with me
0	yeah
0	anon nametype f type name yeah i d go with anon nametype f type name or like i d text her in the day and be like you know do you wanna go for a run maybe go for a run when i get in or there d be nobody in when you get in so it would be like well pause dur short there s not really anything to do there s no one to talk to so
0	no
0	as i m running i m like you should do this more often it would get easier and you would start to enjoy it again
0	no er pause dur short i think it is just so off putting isn t the first time
0	vocal desc yawn
0	wasn t off putting it was a nice day pause dur short yeah sort of hard work but that s alright pause dur long yeah vocal desc yawn i m trying to get well i ve asked me dad if he wants to go and play racquetball too
0	yeah pause dur short that s
0	yeah
0	build it into your routine
0	yeah
0	enjoy it it won t last long
0	pulled pork on a pizza
0	everything pulled pork everything
0	give it time
0	flavoured crisps
0	yeah oh god i haven t had lilt for ages do they still make that
0	i i think so but the isn t that the the the thinking behind that is because pause dur short certain certain colours like before we ve even opened a product or eaten something
0	yellows and greens
0	yellows and greens isn t it that kind of trunc coo trunc crisp and refreshing
0	yeah
0	whereas like pause dur short you know we ve got
0	it s like they ve made the
0	why is red hot
0	like trunc na trunc
0	off vocal desc laugh
0	natural sugar or something
0	about it and their thing was yeah this is the you know they were saying at first this can t be much better for you than normal sugar and then they did loads of research into it and they found out that pause dur short the natural sweeteners
0	uhu
0	yeah
0	it was
0	yeah that s what it was
0	i ve never seen anything
0	some people trunc d trunc oh anyway
0	so i i always think like i just think if you put on a bag of crisps pause dur short obviously there s like spectrums of flavour
0	whatever they make the chicken flavouring out of
0	or beef
0	or
0	put a kind of meaty kind of taste on something
0	oh prawn cocktail like ah yes it tastes like prawn
0	mm they do taste weird
0	haven t had them for a while
0	i mean i dunno the i think salt and vinegar s fair but you know the way it s like green like why do trunc y trunc you just know it s salt and vinegar s green isn t it blue no it s like a light blue isn t it
0	no it s green in walkers but everywhere else it s blue
0	although saying that the aldi version are now green pause dur short cos it used to be walkers were opposite but i think now they ve all come in line with walkers and salt and vinegar is green and cheese and onion is blue
0	what s barbeque
0	black
0	black like trunc char trunc
0	why is that purple
0	dunno it tastes like purple
0	vocal desc laugh
0	why vocal desc laugh when
0	when we were in erm the curry house the other week in anon type place there was a thing and it was erm it was green it was like this dip no one knew what it was so everyone was dipping into it but everyone agreed that it didn t taste like green which is quite worrying really i think we d all sort of had this break this sort of synaesthesia moment and we were like
0	it doesn t but everyone everyone just agreed it should taste red it should be red
0	it was dead strange but everyone was just like passing it around like
0	yeah
0	what trunc co trunc like colour do you think that is
0	what colour would that be
0	yeah
0	like to taste they like do a blindfold taste and say like what colour food do you think that is
0	who
0	oh okay i thought you said like something you d read
0	vocal desc laugh a curry house
0	i can
0	mm pause dur short i think previously i was sort of looking forward to all these gigs but now i m like oh money
0	yeah it s all paid for i mean i don t have to like spend loads of money when i m there so
0	will anon nametype f type name be there
0	have they moved
0	birthday
0	slash engagement
0	slash engagement
0	yeah i know i put them in the office but i don t ever go in there
0	no they won t
0	he came he came when i called it
0	mm
0	go on
0	what do you call a freelancer without a girlfriend
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	well
0	mm
0	yeah
0	uhu
0	and do not contact the university before the sixteenth pause dur short so i think if they don t get pause dur short emails out pause dur short everyone s just gonna ring up on thursday aren t they well i won t but people will do surely pause dur short just like i want to trunc kn trunc i m just wondering blah blah blah blah blah
0	yeah but then there s things like erm pause dur short the they only request a reference if you get an interview and the references have to be in by the twenty fifth of trunc oc trunc twenty fourth of october so that s next friday pause dur short so they ve got to give people at least a week to write a reference it s a bit harsh if they don t
0	so do you think your tutor would you she get in touch with you if she d been contacted
0	so so what they will contact you and say pause dur short you ve got an interview get a reference
0	provide references yeah contact your references and get them to
0	tutor erm i haven t told her about that one i ve got pause dur short to
0	and she d write a good one
0	so you re not worried about getting hold of a reference
0	or anything i mean i m for seventeen places what would you say about sixty people pause dur short maybe
0	i know but like
0	yeah to not even be shortlisted
0	and then and then when it doesn t happen you sort of you sort of post rationalise things and and and sort of say oh well you know fair enough maybe i could have done this and maybe i could have done that but you d end up driving yourself insane
0	that s why i think it was on the front of the independent today there was erm pause dur short there was like some very big grand headline that was britain gets back to work
0	and it was like employment levels at pre
0	pre recession highs but that s such a misleading
0	yeah

0	zero hour contracts
0	a no nonsense contract
0	yesterday
0	those were yesterday were
0	how did they go
0	were you not expected to partake
0	can t afford to pay
0	didn t get a one percent pay rise along with the rest of the country erm and haven t had a pay rise for years but they the government just came out yesterday and said oh yeah we can give you the one percent pay rise if you want but we ll have to make job cuts pause dur short so it s like vocal desc laugh
0	yeah exactly it s like well this is blackmail really isn t it

0	it s still a lot of money pause dur short to spend on a
0	halloween trunc costu trunc er new year costume
0	can you think of any pause dur short jobs i can do
0	any money was
0	just just to go
0	cos it wasn t tidying it was cleaning and like you know things like a dish tray that hadn t been cleaned since like
0	but then trunc sh trunc the thing is is like she was ridiculously generous the rest of the time so i guess

0	no one listens
0	when he said about this woman s grassed them up cos i was like i bet you sit on these all the time
0	and think that would be really funny if i said that
0	and he just keeps them to himself
0	vocal desc laugh
0	he s secretly the funniest man in the world
0	vocal desc laugh pause dur short you don t have to watch this programme and you still know what you can still get the storyline
0	mm trunc sh trunc cos she s the best at everything
0	why
0	oh cos it s just boring
0	and why s that
0	just don t trunc fi trunc i don t find it funny pause dur short i don t find it interesting i don t find it clever pause dur short and then i just think well she wrote it so
0	no she didn t
0	did she not produce this
0	like anon nametype f type name
0	me
0	yeah
0	woeful it s
0	does she still look like
0	unsurprisingly she s put on a bit of weight but i think she was quite skinny when she was young wasn t she so
0	what s that
0	donate
0	vocal desc laugh yeah but
0	yeah i suppose it is isn t it
0	there s probably there s there is there is like er they ve very
0	trunc reg trunc regulations
0	oh
0	it s very difficult to screw people over on it or something like that
0	yeah
0	this looks unclear mortifying unclear
0	oh pause dur short wonderfully vile and exciting all at the same
0	time
0	i know
0	to
0	have you trunc pl trunc have you played grand theft auto before vocal desc laugh no there s none er there s not there s no rape in grand theft auto
0	it is actually
0	call of duty is but call
0	call of duty originally i think i trunc don trunc i kind of remember playing like one of the first or second ones and yeah it was violent it was you know but it was no different to any other game at the time
0	yeah
0	it looks real i think
0	yeah it just
0	and it trunc loo trunc it didn t look real so it was kind of okay it was palatable
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	mm
0	computer games are more immersive than film in film it s easier to kind of sit and say i m i m this is a a product whereas when we re doing the
0	but i think when you re doing it when you re engaging with it more that s worse because like you kind of
0	they blur
0	yeah
0	mm
0	oh that s a shame
0	fifteen years ago people change
0	is that
0	i was watching this and i was i was thinking how rusty like pause dur short the the the acting was in it and obviously it s a low budget comedy like it s you know it s nothing to go run past a series or two pause dur short but what amazed me was that i was thinking about like her acting wasn t very good in it pause dur short and neither was the trunc g trunc it well most people s acting wasn t good in it
0	but i was thinking like how pause dur short those characters like clarissa and and sabrina pause dur short you know she they were like her weren t they they were synonymous with her
0	so and i guess when you re a kid you don t really you re not very discerning about pause dur long see this is funny
0	i just don t think you like this kind of tv
0	but
0	that s trunc fini trunc
0	that s finished

0	who are you and what have done with that just those kind of jokes all day
0	i don t have to watch it
0	no it s not you just need to watch the first like minute to like jog your memory of what happens in that episode and then it s like oh yeah that was really good
0	yeah pause dur long what programmes did you used to like

1	mm mm
1	it s just that i we could go to my man if you would like i mean

1	and erm i don t know that she wants one with eighty five on but you know
1	oh is she going to be eighty five this year
1	i think so yes
1	mm no i m i m a bit in two minds about whether
1	but erm
1	you should put years on cards
1	yeah well i mean apart from key key
1	what like a hundred or something
1	no you know when it s like
1	twenty one
1	sixty or fifty or twenty one
1	yes yes
1	that kind of thing
1	yes but some people
1	we can
1	are more sensitive than others about it
1	we could ask i just sent an ordinary card to anon nametype f type name i should have sent one with an enormous sixty on a big sixty
1	right
1	to be naughty
1	yeah pause dur short i can t believe the ages we all are
1	yes so erm we could go to my man see you could have a see if he s got any diaries and i don t know whether he has
1	mm
1	erm he ll probably have the one like mine but whether he s got any i think he
1	oh yes
1	i think he has that sort of shape and we could go and see
1	mm
1	what he s got and see if there s an auntie anon nametype f type name s card
1	i could erm
1	and ask him if he s got any line on key trunc fo trunc trunc k trunc key fobs calendar
1	tabs
1	tabs
1	tabs fobs
1	tabs or fobs
1	yes
1	one might be american i don t know
1	i ve never really heard either
1	yeah
1	i would just think of them as little calendars
1	yes but erm the lady in wilko knew what we were talking about
1	yes and i checked on the website
1	yeah yeah
1	and they weren t in
1	no because i was too early going in cos they hadn t even got their dairies erm cos the lady in there said we haven t got ours yet but if you go to clintons cards or you know one of these sorts of shops
1	yeah
1	she said if you go to one of those they ll have they ll have unclear autumn unclear diaries but that that i know they ve got their diaries in but you know wilko s was telling me to go to the other shop
1	oh wilko s yeah
1	she says because we haven t got ours yet you know so i know they ve got them i thought i don t think they ll want you to divert your
1	yes yes
1	rather than saying they re in next week get one in there
1	yeah the lady in the anon type place shop was actually very helpful wasn t she
1	oh yes yeah yes they usually are cos i wasn t trunc su trunc i wasn t sure she d know what i was talking about but she unclear thinking what vocal desc laugh because if they re of an age group where they may have made a calendar at school and stuck a thing on it they ll know what you mean
1	mm
1	but a lot of more recent children may not have done that
1	no pause dur short
1	as a craft activity
1	i mean it still seems to be you can buy them in bulk unclear
1	you can buy them yes but you know
1	yeah
1	how many schools actually have people who do
1	mm
1	or like anon nametype n type name where we made the paper we did the did you do that did you do it with anon nametype n type name did you do erm where he got you get like a big well it s like having a big meeting and you get some sort of tray and it s got water in it and they couldn t have been ordinary inks they must have been sort of like an oil on water
1	yes yes
1	ink and the trunc pap trunc the paper goes on
1	mm
1	put it sort of swirl it about and you put the paper on and i don t think you run the paper through it because it would be smeary put the paper on
1	mm
1	it s probably just decent cartridge paper as we used to have in those days and it s got the it has all this sort of dotty swirly patterns on in the did you do that and then we used that to cover a board you know mitre and cover
1	oh yes i know about mitring and covering
1	and put the ribbon on and put the little thing for the trunc ca trunc and the calendar and i think we put a and you could put your own picture on
1	yes
1	and the background was this sort of you know you could
1	yeah
1	i think you know there was like a pinkie one and a bluey one a green one and you could and er i didn t do that you know i i made the calendar with the paper but i didn t do the oil on water business but i saw it in i used to have this i guess i got it for a christmas present
1	yeah
1	one of these books of you know
1	unclear
1	oh erm
1	choccy in the trousers
1	erm chocolate trouser uh books of like things to do and it always looked really exciting but i didn t think it was ever gonna happen
1	yeah
1	erm and last year we went to the anon type place fair which
1	yes
1	indeed it s on today
1	yes
1	christmas fair there
1	yes
1	and they had somebody who was selling kind of kits of that
1	oh right
1	it was quite impressive
1	yeah
1	and you could do it on paper you could do it on anything and i can t think quite how it all worked now but it was obviously some sort of you made patterns out of inks because you could even do it on fabric you know it was it was safe
1	yeah but trunc i trunc it
1	and dry as soon as it came out
1	yeah well it s something where you do it kind it s like on water or unless you do it on oil unless it s oil unless it s a tray of oil with ink on inks on it it s something where where the the erm coloured stuff is on the surface of the
1	yeah yeah i understand the principle
1	but i don t know whether it s oil with water water ink or water with oil ink
1	mm mm
1	you know which way around it is cos anon nametype n type name was good on the old
1	yes
1	arty crafties
1	yeah it was sad his daughter isn t it that she had such an awful time do you remember i got that letter she had such an awful time at anon type place
1	his daughter
1	anon nametype f type name
1	anon nametype f type name
1	he had one daughter
1	yes i had her hockey boots in fact we had her trunc ho trunc hockey boots
1	oh right
1	remember the black hockey boots
1	yes i do
1	that laced up that took you hours to get into
1	unclear
1	because there was not they were proper hockey boots they looked like
1	i think everyone had to have them
1	i know but they d i mean they were sort of things you had to have for school but
1	mm
1	because they looked like erm what used to be sort of those american plimsoll things that came up to your
1	yes
1	you know what i mean they looked like those with knobbly
1	mm i think they re called baseball shoes
1	baseball boots
1	no i don t know
1	they re like they used to be like erm
1	yes i know i have some
1	yes and they but they had a knobbly underfoot
1	mm
1	but it used to take me hours to get them on
1	yes then there was hockey unclear
1	and then you had to run to the top of the field and back so by the time i d done that
1	yes
1	trunc every trunc everybody had been put in a team vocal desc laugh
1	and it always seemed to be cold and horrible when we played hockey
1	yes
1	but some people it seems enjoy the sport
1	some people unclear
1	anyway i was telling you about anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name
1	anon nametype f type name yes anon nametype m type name s daughter
1	daughter
1	who married a german man
1	erm i wrote a letter to her after i found that anon nametype n type name had died
1	oh right yes
1	and i must have given her my email perhaps
1	yes
1	well i guess i must have
1	mm
1	and she emailed back saying how nice to have the letter
1	yes
1	and she was er pleased to hear i had a good er we both had a good experience with anon nametype n type name
1	yes anon nametype n type name yeah
1	because erm she was put in anon nametype n type name s class her father s class which is unusual
1	mm no
1	because normally at anon type place they don t
1	no
1	and she said she had the most horrid time being taught by him
1	yeah
1	she really hated it and it was really
1	yes
1	coloured her view of being at anon type place
1	yes but she was a bit older than me
1	was she oh unclear well unclear she must ve been
1	she passed on the hockey boots so she would ve left she would ve already have left wherever whatever school she was at presumably unless her feet grew rapidly erm pause dur short to have passed on her hockey boots
1	mm yeah i don t i don t i don t think i ve ever met her
1	so she could be like five years older than me
1	mm
1	unclear but unclear she wasn t i don t know what school she went to maybe anon type place unclear i dunno unclear unclear
1	probably anon type place i would guess
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	well it s a bit much isn t it cos you ve er erm if you ve got your father all day and at home as well
1	for two whole years
1	because was she was an only child as well wasn t she
1	mm mm
1	so she unclear yeah she unclear it was just her yeah
1	but i was i mean it it has happened because
1	well it s just the way it worked out cos she d be in the as
1	i think they tried to manage it so we didn t get in our parent s class or it may have just been
1	well er you can t help it if if in like in those days anon nametype n type name it was either anon nametype n type name or father
1	or anon nametype n type name
1	or anon nametype n type name
1	or anon nametype n type name
1	dunno whether anon nametype n type name didn t do trunc s trunc top set usually
1	mm
1	he did well he trunc d trunc he didn t do four a
1	mm
1	three a four a he might ve done
1	mm
1	i don t trunc th trunc he didn t do the as pause dur short he might ve done the the bs
1	anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name was in pause dur short anon nametype m type name and erm vocal desc gasp the youngest anon nametype n type name what s the youngest anon nametype n type name s name
1	anon nametype m type name
1	anon nametype m type name
1	yeah
1	anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name were in the same class and they were in anon nametype n type name s so
1	anon nametype m type name was in anon nametype n type name s class yeah what was that when it was a
1	three a four a
1	four trunc h trunc when did he have father
1	that was anon nametype m type name
1	oh that was anon nametype m type name sorry yeah
1	the the er the other boy
1	yeah but i mean it is difficult from that point of view because if you only have say three trunc s trunc masters
1	mm
1	who are going to do that
1	mm
1	then the trunc likeli trunc if you ve got a few children the likelihood of you getting your parent
1	mm
1	is quite high
1	yeah unclear well they unclear it s worked out quite well i mean they they know you re coming don t they they ve got a few years to plan it
1	mm up to a point unclear
1	because dad didn t always trunc d trunc do i mean he did other things didn t he
1	oh he he occasionally he did he he did erm the remove one year vocal desc laugh
1	and he has he needed to have the c and d classes
1	mm
1	didn t he unclear used to have unclear cs anyway
1	well that s it that s what i say the remove
1	mm
1	which was
1	mm
1	sort of vocal desc laugh dropping off the scale vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	mm
1	it was a nice letter tonice erm email from anon nametype m type name
1	yes saying saying about father yeah
1	saying how much saying how much he er he was a lost eleven year old and how he helped and
1	yes
1	without anon type place and without dad he wouldn t ve got to
1	no
1	anon type place and without anon type place he wouldn t ve got to university
1	well when we heard that programme i told anon nametype m type name
1	mm and he is just so like anon nametype m type name
1	yeah
1	i mean i don t know whether i mean that that sort of look
1	mm
1	erm i mean the all the anon nametype n type name children have er look quite similar
1	yes
1	but you know because he s got the dark hair
1	mm
1	and some of the sort of some of the clothes you were showing that belonged to anon nametype m type name
1	yeah
1	but i don t suppose i ll ever get to see the anon nametype n type name it s hard enough even keeping
1	no
1	up with with anon nametype f type name
1	well anon nametype m type name might have liked to have done something in the music industry you know sound sound engineer
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	type thing
1	well he could have applied to the bbc but
1	but er you know it it wasn t
1	well he kind of wanted to stay in anon type place although unclear
1	no i mean earlier earlier when he was at university he could have gone into sound
1	yes well we all could have gone into many different things
1	computers and things he did electronics but you see sound engineer wasn t kind of a
1	mm
1	kind of an acceptable career path in some ways
1	mm
1	in our in in those days because they they didn t i mean now i mean like like is it anon nametype m type name s sons have have done something or something like that
1	one of them is isn t he yeah
1	yeah but they were both a bit sort of something in that direction because that one was only working in an estate agents as a
1	oh yes that was
1	temporary job
1	no no it was his while he was a term time job at university
1	yeah and that s what i mean it was a just a
1	it meant he had a car because
1	yeah
1	either he was given the car to do the job or he had the car because
1	but there were actually courses on
1	mm
1	sound engineering and things where
1	yeah i think it would do i think
1	you can now but
1	there s something trunc a trunc at erm whatever anglia ruskin is called these days
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	you know the old poly
1	yeah
1	there s erm i think they have the best course of the type in something to do with audio or something to do because erm er oh a friend of somebody came up anyway
1	yes well this is it it s a more recent kind of thing especially with all the digital and stuff
1	mm
1	and anon nametype m type name would have quite liked that
1	and there s lots of things now that trunc w trunc weren t sort of jobs
1	yes
1	because i always thought it was interesting the erm the upstairs downstairs the downstairs bit of the upstairs downstairs of you know like things like stately homes and actually finding out how ordinary people lived cos history was all about the the posher people it seems
1	well anon nametype n type name did but i used to like the social history and anon nametype n type name did social history
1	but there was so little it wasn t i mean perhaps it was done at school some of them
1	yeah
1	but it wasn t it wasn t thought worthy of university
1	oh no no
1	university didn t want to be thinking about things like that
1	oh no
1	and the national trust whatever it was doing was not it it s only in the last ten years
1	might have done kings and queens
1	that it s opened up you know the
1	yeah
1	other areas like the dairy and the you know it s it s the
1	that s right we only do the kings and queens and the royal
1	and the and er where do where is it anon type place or anon type place no i don t go to anon type place very much it must be anon type place and they ve only
1	we went somewhere where somebody was doing butter or cheese or
1	oh yes that was erm
1	something somewhere
1	that anon type place they they
1	yes
1	they do more with the erm the other people because until recently they they didn t do anything about the polish folk who were down there
1	no
1	cos they were living in anon type place doing the erm oh doing radio you know a bit of a minor erm
1	anon type place
1	anon type place
1	yes yeah pause dur short
1	and that was i mean there were other things too and they just weren t weren t jobs
1	yes
1	and stuff with biology was very limited and when i was at school i wanted to do design stuff in art choosing erm er things from the biology slides you know
1	yes
1	when you put make a slide and you stain it
1	yes
1	and use the shapes and the colours from those
1	yes
1	and that was thought to be a a non thing to do
1	well that might have been and gone because that was big in the early sixties
1	well nobody thought it was a worthy thing to spend time doing in art
1	well this is it you see the likes of erm pause dur short early pink floyd used to do slides and things on their back projections of things
1	mm mm mm
1	which was an innovation
1	yes
1	and at college we used to do well it s like my pottery and things seed pods and cross sections and all of that which was late sixties erm but it kind of had been and gone by the time you got to do yours probably
1	well maybe
1	and wasn t considered
1	it wasn t considered a thing to do
1	a thing it wasn t a thing it wasn t in vogue either really
1	no
1	and you see with anon nametype m type name he did his electronic and electrical and he only had a you know half a term on these things called computers and they had this enormous thing you could add two and two on kind of stuff you know didn t do much you could write a little program for it
1	mm that s what i used at university
1	but erm that was you know in when did anon nametype m type name come out of university seventy two three and then of course he did his he went to do his electronical things and then computers came in so that s why he sort of took up an interest in that cos that was the new thing
1	mm
1	cos it wasn t something you did at university
1	university in nineteen eighty two or nineteen eighty three i was doing ecology and statistics and ecology and you had to use a mainframe linked to a mainframe that was in the states or something
1	yes
1	you know was and you know you put you punched it all in and whatever you had to do
1	yes
1	and then you got like forty two out you know
1	yes was was it because as i say anon nametype m type name you know anon nametype m type name had to learn all that on his own really until he got into a company that sent him on courses
1	and so yeah eighty two and then by the time eighty five the end of eighty five no the yeah the autumn eighty five
1	mm
1	we were getting erm pcs
1	mm
1	which you know are still recognisable in some ways although people people wouldn t know what to do with them if if they ve only used a
1	mm
1	windows eight environment or whatever
1	well that s what anon nametype m type name found with the younger engineers erm pause dur short they didn t know any history of erm some sort of things like i can t really think of anything sensible here but er not the examples but there would be something or other and they d come across the problem they d come across a problem and say we ve got this problem and anon nametype m type name would say well you ve got to do da da da da to get around that and they d say well why is that sort of thinking
1	mm
1	because he said because this thing is derived from you know something back
1	mm
1	you know previously
1	yeah
1	so that s how you know it s developed from that so you know on the logic of erm you know that s how that was kind of evolved so it s working that you know cos anon nametype m type name would say oh well you know anon nametype m type name did nt four or whatever which these young people didn t know
1	mm
1	and things or they d come across something that had something that was a bit old in it and they wouldn t know what to do and anon nametype m type name would say blah blah blah and they d say uh and he d say well because that s the next one after nt four and they developed that from that
1	mm
1	i mean they didn t all work like that but you know he knew the ones that which they hadn t got any idea of what pause dur short
1	no
1	you know they trunc ken trunc they knew kind of erm like we say windows eight and they or whatever and they d know the the sort of more recent numbers but they wouldn t know
1	mm
1	things further back cos he d been sort of on the more or less the whole lot of it
1	and i rather suspect that erm anon nametype n type name might be in the same in the same boat
1	yeah trunc al trunc although he s a lecturer rather than a
1	well he s an academic at anon type place but he he s
1	i don t know what his actual qualifications are in that sense
1	no but he s he s in the computing area isn t he
1	mm i mean he won t he may not know the ins and outs of it but somebody has to for him to have set up the stuff in the museum
1	yes so
1	and that s why anon nametype m type name would have liked to have helped him with
1	oh yes
1	with the sun stuff he could have helped him with the sun stuff
1	that would have been oh he probably could have helped with all sorts of things actually
1	well all of it but he trunc recon trunc he recognised the sun stuff cos he worked on it and he s probably got the spare parts as i say and he s got the sun manual
1	yeah it would be brilliant if erm pause dur short well if if
1	the anon nametype n type name memorial wing yes
1	did i tell you i had that email from anon nametype m type name
1	yes saying yes
1	and he still looks happy and keen
1	yeah
1	and in the email i sent i did emphasise about erm you know that anon nametype m type name would have liked his stuff to have gone there
1	yes
1	and you know that cos in case he just forgot who we were cos it s been a while since we ve been in touch
1	well as i say and it also would be worth mentioning that having trunc s trunc i think you mentioned that we d seen it on a programme
1	oh yeah er well i i think i mentioned him originally
1	originally because had anon nametype m type name have had you know the wherewithal to be able to get there
1	mm cos it s not like a million miles away but it is a bit awkward isn t it
1	it s not a million miles but it s an awkward thing to sort of commute to
1	cos that journey s a bit not very nice is it
1	no it s little roads and things but if it say if it was if it was just like anon type place or anon type place anon type place you know sort of closer round then he would have been able to sort of go probably
1	unclear
1	yeah you know just somewhere on the outskirts but it s just that little bit too far
1	mm
1	but erm this is it you say to him as an ex sun sun engineer and as an ex sun one of the trunc co trunc companies he worked for he was an ex sun engineer erm he he trunc w trunc would have er been quite interested in helping
1	yeah well that sadly is not gonna happen
1	no no
1	but unclear
1	cos he did all the trunc s trunc he did a the suns at anon type place university you see because anon type place has probably got i don t know whether he ever worked at anon type place but he he certainly did suns at anon type place in fact some of them may still have anon nametype n type name well they won t now they ve chucked them out but you know what i mean they used to have his name in them vocal desc laugh cos he did some for the now what was it it was the was it the linguistics department
1	yeah
1	no not the linguistics pause dur short something to do with language and speech and it might be linguistics pause dur short which seems to be in the bowels of the earth at anon type place university and there was this sort of little man who was like a little mole and he was one of these sort of characters unkempt with a sort of nylon shirt
1	mm
1	in this rather close erm warm room vocal desc laugh which was not the best thing i think it was a bit fragrant down there and this boffin person this he was he was something to do with language and erm pause dur short not from the point of erm literature and things but it was in the components of language and how languages are you know
1	that sounds like linguistics
1	linguistics that s it it was trunc a trunc it was something to do with linguistics and this little fellow had suns down in his den because anon nametype m type name used to go down and he was a a funny man cos he didn t he was one of these little fellows who got on and he didn t trunc s trunc anon nametype m type name had a great had to sort of talk talk to him cos he wasn t used to talking to people cos i think he was about the only person who worked down there so he had to kind of erm get him the get him socialised vocal desc laugh him first cos he he didn t
1	yeah
1	sort of communicate all he did was do his wires and anon nametype m type name was trying to sort out and make sure he d got done the thing he wanted him to do you know but he was a funny little man and i can t remember what his name was but he said he was a very difficult character
1	and he was the guy who did linguistics
1	yeah but he he did he was kind of researching
1	oh
1	the sort of technicalities of it and writing it down and you know
1	yes
1	programming bits and comparing different things and doing all that sort of stuff i don t know it was a particular part of something was this project and nobody else seemed to work with him now whether it was because he was a bit erm in a hot room or whether nobody else was interested and i think anon nametype m type name was the one who usually got sent there cos vocal desc laugh not many people wanted to go
1	yes
0	erm yeah no i think with like i m thinking forty pounds
0	yeah i already spoke to him erm i sent him an email last week i didn t go to my training session on thursday
0	no
0	work out yeah yeah
0	i haven t lost any weight i ve actually gained it
0	oh thank you i think i just like toned more like i know that i m always going to have a big bum i ve always had a big bum and i can accept that
0	yeah but i don t yeah i mean i don t put it on really here as much as i like i obviously i had like a slightly i had a i have a food baby occasionally but like i normally have an okay stomach so i m not too worried about it but that s the one thing i like about kim kardashian she s brought it big bums
0	yeah she s brought in the small waist and the big bum that s the one thing i like about her everything else i loathe but
0	yeah
0	thirteenth of september
0	shit
0	i i was like
0	thirteenth of september
0	mm
0	and erm i think if i enjoy it and i do okay
0	amazing
0	i ll do it again but yeah it was like i think cos sunday was a really really nice day and i set out running with a friend of mine and we weren t like pushing it like i wasn t like i probably could have tried a little bit harder but i just wanted to do the distance to be honest
0	okay
0	yeah
0	but erm i was expecting to do a bit more than i did
0	you shouldn t you shouldn t push yourself
0	mm
0	yeah exactly you want to build it up so that you can train like more times a week and not kill yourself
0	yeah yeah
0	or be in pain so
0	yeah
0	erm so yeah so i ll just leave it for now and erm
0	yeah it s just so hard and like it it took a lot i ve been thinking it for a while and then i was just sitting at work and i was like you know what i m really poor at the moment like
0	and i don t go out and drink all the time like i don t blow my money on other things it s just i have more important things to pay for and and then also this month i m going to barcelona and then i m going to paris so both i m doing quite cheaply but still
0	yeah
0	never going to do it and i like i think unless you re really into it and you have the time to dedicate
0	yeah no that s no that s what i think but like it s really good when you re there but he doesn t really do anything outside of that hour
0	yeah
0	like my money was worth it with him
0	twice a week
0	okay
0	it is thirty five if you just do it once a week
0	okay
0	mm and so with him so it s not like i m learning weightlifting but i m
0	fitness like lifestyle yeah
0	exactly erm so once i get to the point where i want to get er
0	but even that week of not doing it you go backwards i m like er
0	and i ve lost like it s so frustrating
0	aerobic yeah like that doesn t seem to disappear as quickly like i can have a week off running
0	exactly yeah
0	then you end up with yeah and yeah you re going to end up like giving something complete like stopping everything
0	mm think of all the shoes i could buy
0	yeah
0	yeah so that erm that s you can treat yourself nicely with that amount
0	mm yeah yeah
0	also cos you live in anon type place it s like me you don t drink because you have to drive
0	like to make myself feel better i would rather sit and eat some
0	we went to this erm we went to anon type place it s like by the seaside somewhere in suffolk somewhere
0	oh no no i think that s actually a good mixture
0	yeah it s weird like i i luckily like for me it s completely platonic like i genuinely have no feelings for him i can understand why girls would fancy him but i just i ve known him for so long i know what he s like but it s it s gone through the oh i kind of fancy him to it s so platonic we re like he s just my friend now but

1	i know yeah and she gave us all those er gave us a load of trees to plant
1	that s right yeah
1	probably thought oh i need to get rid of these trees who could i give them to
1	she was a nice lady though
1	yeah she was
1	did we have to pay for that
1	yes we paid a lot of money several hundred
1	yeah just to have the goat the milk measured
1	yeah but it was kind of important to us to be recognised really
1	oh we did get recognised didn t we
1	that s what you do isn t it you have to pay unfortunately for this that and the other
1	yeah
1	otherwise you don t get anywhere
1	i remember the anon type place the anon type place had to stay the night didn t i
1	yeah
1	had to sleep in a pen in a goat s pen
1	yeah then we came to see you no you had to come and fetch us the next day did you

1	i came and fetched you
1	came and fetched us first thing in the morning
1	yeah pause dur long crikey
1	that was good then
1	that was good and that s where we lost anon nametype f type name wasn t it
1	only briefly didn t we
1	yeah i know but she she wandered off didn t she
1	yeah
1	and that was it she was just looking at the rabbits the other side of the rabbit cage
1	yeah
1	and we thought where s she gone
1	disappeared oh there you are anon nametype f type name
1	oh dear pause dur short but it s just a fleeting moment isn t it
1	mm
1	where you yeah god that oh dear yeah
1	panicky for a little while wasn t it
1	it was panicky for about two minutes but there you are that was twelve pound a pen and i had to buy a pen for me to sleep in
1	yeah so we ve spent a lot of money over we wouldn t dream of spending that now
1	no i mean you re you re talking thirty thirty five years ago
1	yeah it was a lot of money wasn t it
1	it was yeah the only thing we didn t have to pay for was the parking
1	yeah we got all got in free but i suppose that paid for half of it
1	we got in free yeah so that was it yeah yeah
1	mm
1	and now it s about twelve quid to park and twelve quid to get in each person well twelve quid to park and twelve quid each person to get in i i
1	it s more than that
1	yeah i think it s twenty five
1	it s double that i think
1	i think it s twenty five now
1	yeah it is
1	that s a wonder anyone go
1	yeah
1	still if you if you think how much we paid then it s all relevant isn t it
1	i guess so yeah
1	it must be
1	but not many people do go now really
1	well i don t know they had a hundred thousand last year
1	unclear
1	on on the thursday and about eighty thousand on the wednesday
1	yeah erm
1	and if they if it didn t pay they wouldn t have it would they
1	no they wouldn t they wouldn t get anyone going would they
1	no god i always remember when when we used to go to school because the school was on the a as well they used to give us two days off
1	yeah well they did up up here in the beginning
1	yeah
1	we had two days everyone had two days off
1	and then they just had thursday off and now they get none
1	and now they don t mm i think they had did they have thursday off last last year i believe
1	i think they re allowed thursday off i think
1	i think they did in the end because they realised that it was stopping a lot of families going
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	otherwise they ve got to get permission to get leave school now to take them out of school
1	not sure unclear a lot of families have belong to farmers around here don t they
1	yeah of course they do the anon nametype n type name always used to go
1	yeah
1	god
1	that was a big get together for them they don t see anyone otherwise
1	well all the farmers have
1	bit remote job really isn t it
1	that used to make me laugh all the farmers used to get together there
1	yeah
1	and they used to go in the beer tent and
1	yeah
1	they used to have a wonderful time
1	probably don t see each other from year to year
1	no but i think now you see that s less less er popular because there s so much legislation about movement of cattle now isn t there cattle and cows
1	yeah trunc pe trunc they re still doing it though
1	yeah but the legislation has gone up a lot because of the foot and mouth that broke out in the country about four or five years ago
1	oh yeah that destroyed a lot of things didn t it
1	that destroyed a lot of stuff
1	a lot of shows were cancelled weren t they
1	they were all cancelled yeah and now because of that they have to they have to be well we had to have movement books anyway didn t we
1	yes
1	just unclear where trunc pe trunc where we took them from
1	anyone who keeps livestock will have to have movement books
1	yeah but that s that s more dense now if you like that s more sort of er strict it s a lot stricter now pause dur short they ve all got to be ear tagged
1	yeah
1	everything has to be ear tagged pause dur short well we didn t have to ear tag them did we we they wanted they said we could have it have that
1	it was just coming in wasn t it
1	it was then coming in then yeah
1	mm i think if we d kept going much more
1	yeah we d have to be ear tagged
1	yeah we d all be tagged
1	well you wouldn t have had to be ear tagged or me but the goats would
1	yeah okay
1	anyway i think we better get on hadn t we
1	yep okay
1	otherwise the day will be gone
1	yep we ll get on
0	yes
0	you ve gotta know how much time and effort they spend giving people treatment pause dur short who kind of yeah are too drunk to know what s going on
0	it wasn t didn t sound drunk
0	a lot of security guys went after him pause dur short which i mean it just sort of i suppose it s sort of a contrast you know really really trying to help people for free

0	yeah pause dur short no pause dur short absolutely pause dur short nah i wouldn t fancy that job
0	i m not sure what pause dur short that was an odd injury

0	he did pause dur short he did but it s still
0	mm pause dur short oh no i mean he did kind of learn to do that but it still made him feel rotten i think
0	is that
0	oh
0	mm
0	actually that s pretty good because we had some break until after pause dur short oh god way after bank holiday pause dur short damn it pause dur short that s only half way through pause dur short oh
0	i don t fucking believe it
0	yeah so throw yourself into your swimming and your weights pause dur short yeah

0	cos when i went it was twelve hundred a year
0	yeah

1	mm
1	unclear she come home unclear separate unclear
1	vocal desc cough pause dur short anon nametype m type name told me er last email he said they sold their house in er where they are in in
1	where unclear in china
1	within the hour
1	unclear
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	unclear ah was it a nice house then he s got there unclear they bought it over there
1	not particularly yeah
1	oh
1	unclear amazing so seems to be undervalued if they sold it so quickly
1	within an hour mm unclear thing that s no good good don t want that pause dur long
1	mm
1	this is unclear i told you this estate agent left the doors unlocked pause dur short and open
1	oh
1	they offered her three hundred pounds erm pause dur short compensation pause dur short although i think to be honest the amount they charge pause dur long
1	what was the compensation for because nothing actually was stolen was it and nobody broke in unclear well unclear
1	well breaking their code of conduct they were told they ve got to keep it secure
1	oh
1	taking something from her premises a key
1	oh really
1	yeah they took the key away pause dur short the key was on a er on a dresser on the top of a clock
1	mm
1	and he d got the same key got the key for the back door but he picked up another one went out left the door right open and left the house with a key when she got back she couldn t go out
1	what was he thinking of
1	well exactly you know just a nutcase they they shouldn t employ people like that really so erm but you know said he s sorry
1	oh sorry i forgot to dry
1	reluctantly no it s alright he said sorry reluctantly pause dur short but i think what unclear she unclear got they re they re extortionately expensive this estate agent erm unclear and unclear you know something like four thousand pounds they charge to sell the house and i she s now asking for a reduction in the in the their charges
1	mm
1	they ve not been very good unclear they re unclear bloody useless they ve got the most awful reputation and she d known if she used her computer before she could ve gone online and seen their reviews about them
1	yeah
1	and it s just awful but this is where you re also much more vulnerable pause dur short when you don t you know you can t have you can t access things like that pause dur short but the thing is they ve got a buyer for this house but she hasn t found another house that she wants so they haven t sent her any
1	mm
1	so
1	so presumably she s got a contract with these people
1	yeah she has got a contract with them and it s a terrible contract it says
1	well can t can t she get out if it by saying you ve broken the terms of your contract
1	yeah they they said yes you can get out of it but if she then said say for instance these people are hanging on wanting her house what they ve said they ve said if those people then have registered with other estate agents which is what you ll all do you go to loads of them and put your name down and you get you know houses from them if they came to her and sold you would have to pay their fees and the new estate agents unclear so unclear it would be eight thousand
1	huh
1	well trunc co trunc and if they come privately up to two years later
1	are you joking
1	yeah oh it s just unclear the used car unclear phone unclear that s unclear this unclear here it s just notorious they re not very professional as you can tell they don t answer phone calls they don t get back to you unclear she s had to i i don t think they re gonna get anywhere and i think but i think they will need to go to the ombudsman er almost as a way of registering their erm negligence so it s probably won t get very far because they unclear offered unclear three hundred quid and she s turned it down she hasn t you know three hundred quid for the inconvenience and the anxiety cos she came back and thought she d been burgled
1	yeah
1	and she thought there was someone in there so you know you get her scared then she couldn t go out because she hadn t got a key to lock the back door
1	vocal desc laugh
1	no it s just and then you you know we ve gone off with this finally the spare key and his set of keys and erm pause dur short she phoned the office oh he ll be back you know he must be can t be far away and it was er well over an hour or so before he came back he could ve cut keys in that time
1	mm
1	so or did he give is did he erm you know allow the other the the viewers to pick things up and touch things and did he go and have to go and get the key off these people who knows nobody knows pause dur short you know will they turn up and burgle her some other time
1	mm
1	so it s you know it s not

0	yeah
1	there we are good morning anon nametype f type name vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh good morning anon nametype f type name
1	erm and erm pause dur short i see from your form that you were born in anon type place in australia
1	mm yes
1	so can you tell me er erm how er how old you were when you left australia
1	yes well if i can go back a step just to explain both my parents er are english
1	yeah
1	or were english and they met on a ship going out
1	right yes
1	and erm my father was a clergyman and he d signed on for five years of unclear poverty chastity and obedience in a trunc b trunc what was called the bush brotherhood in anon type place
1	right right oh
1	and erm so it was a bit inconvenient really that he met my mother going out but anyway they kept in touch for five years and at the end of his five years of going around the bush erm he they got married
1	right
1	and er and then the war came and he was a chaplain in the australian army and then erm we lived in two two parishes in anon type place and came back to england when i was seven
1	oh right
1	and that was quite hard for my mother because she d left all her family behind
1	right
1	cos the whole family had emigrated but not together she d gone separately erm so pause dur short anyway that that s what happened and and we ended up in anon type place actually because my father had to look for a parish and for us to live somewhere pause dur short erm and so i spent most of my childhood in in anon type place just over the border from anon type place actually so we used to do our shopping in anon type place so coming to live in anon type place was a little bit like coming home
1	yes i see it s it s it s a a bit weird because we ve got similar circumstances cos my father was actually erm he he became a padre in the army erm but but he was also a vicar and we moved from anon type place when i was seven erm and erm we went to germany for three years
1	really
1	and another thing that i can draw a parallel with is that when we came back from germany cos he did three years that s all it was a sort of er appeal from the bishop for erm clergy to go abroad and when we came back there was no living for us and we had to look for one and that was extremely difficult we ended up living in anon type place
1	oh goodness me
1	isn t it strange
1	well there s a bigger coincidence because when we came back from australia we had to sort of stay with various people and we came to anon type place and stayed in erm the on the edge of the park pause dur short can t think of the name of the road
1	erm anon type place
1	anon type place yeah we caught with a former colleague of my my mother s and erm dad went to see the bishop of anon type place
1	right
1	to look for a living
1	really
1	and one of the livings that was available was anon type place
1	was it
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	how weird
1	that is probably not just after your father left it because i m i m a lot older than you so it would ve all happened before
1	right before how weird
1	yes yes
1	isn t the life s full of coincidences isn t it
1	it is pause dur short but it but i think i don t know why he decided against it it just didn t feel right presumably and we ended up actually in a lovely place on the coast near anon type place
1	oh oh wow yes
1	he had two parishes anon type place
1	oh right course anon type place is very i mean the war the horrible war story there and the tragedy of anon type place yes
1	yes yes yes well at the time that wasn t the facts weren t really known
1	ah it was all secret then wasn t it
1	it was a bit secret
1	yeah
1	and er but while we were there erm the commemoration erm stone was put up but still people didn t really know the full details unless they d lived there all their lives and and i don t think anybody ever told us how it really happened
1	right no no it s come out a lot recently hasn t it
1	it has yes
1	erm and erm you know it it was one of those things that you just couldn t they just couldn t erm they were having an exercise i believe weren t they
1	yes yes
1	and then the unclear u boat unclear came up and and and saw them exercising and wiped a lot of them out it was just terrible
1	that s right yes yes yes
1	erm but you must have had a a very interesting childhood what did you what do you remember of australia then
1	erm well just a few impressions really erm pause dur short er not a lot i remember going to school and it was rather sort of marshal we had to do exercises in the playground we went in unclear to to unclear music
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	erm and i just remember playing and er remember doing in a vicarage which had had a tennis court but it was terribly overrun and er overgrown rather erm vocal desc laugh my parents decided they d have some chickens but of course the wire netting had all gone in the corners and all the chickens escaped unclear so it was pretty unclear
1	oh right yeah
1	erm i had lots of cousins and i still do and i get a little visit from time to time
1	right
1	in fact erm pause dur short at a recent count i had seventeen first cousins
1	really
1	yes
1	seventeen
1	but they lived a long way away
1	yes yes
1	and and er so we didn t see them often but that trunc w trunc that was nice so i trunc d trunc i vaguely remember things but not not anything very spectacular i remember the planned visit of erm i think princess elizabeth as she then was
1	right oh right
1	we were all issued with medals which i still have
1	oh
1	but she but she didn t come because her her father died
1	oh
1	erm pause dur short i do remember that i remember being attacked by erm kookaburra
1	oh right
1	but it vocal desc laugh it s put me off birds flying around for life
1	i m sure i m sure
1	erm but trunc the trunc they are a little bit possessive of their nests unclear they get a bit aggressive unclear
1	yes
1	erm but i can t really remember many things i remember sort of visits to other members of the family and
1	yes what about erm did you ever go sort of on on a trunc f trunc sheep farm or erm one of those large sheep farms they have in in the centre of australia
1	no
1	no visits there
1	no we were in anon type place
1	right
1	vocal desc cough i suppose there were sheep farms but i don t remember them as being anything very special
1	yes no no
1	i do remember trunc f trunc having trunc t trunc to take a plane to get to sydney a little tiny plane
1	oh right yes
1	that was vocal desc cough cos that was quite a long way away for us
1	right er were you are you interested at all or have you read in in the past the works of nevil shute
1	yes unclear a tiny bit unclear yes
1	and a town like alice
1	well that was i think the town or the area where my father was and so it was very interesting
1	oh was it yes oh i ve i ve been i ve rediscovered nevil shute a while ago actually
1	ah
1	i read them all when i was about sixteen and i ve rediscovered them all a while ago
1	yes
1	erm and i ve started rereading them but i really must keep up on that because it s amazing how clear they are in my head yet still i miss so much in my memory and going back to nevil shute is wonderful
1	mm mm yes
1	erm and of course it s what i m going forty year forty years ago when i read the last book and and of it s even more trunc e trunc er of an era almost vintage stuff really
1	yes yes it s a good idea to go back and reread because i think the first time you read you read for the story don t you
1	yes you do yes
1	the second time you you read as much for the story as for the detail or the detail as much as the story
1	do you find that too with watching drama on television because some of the morse for instance and the lewis erm series i don t know whether you like them but erm we find and the frost the good series a good drama series we find that we don t watch them trunc we trunc when we watch just one for the second time which we try not to do but we do i always say to my husband i m watching them for the acting i love the acting the way they play the parts so it s so good and how they inter react with the other characters and that i find absolutely fascinating which like you say i m not looking for the narrative because i know really what happens cos i ve seen it before
1	mm mm yes ah yes yes yes
1	erm you you see the erm the frisson between erm lewis and er his sidekick erm and how they talk to one another and the body language and everything is just right er and and also the actors have evolved that over time they ve started to work together so much that they they re actually in a relationship as the part rather than acting the part
1	yes
1	so it s very good
1	oh yeah yes that s that s an interesting aspect my my husband doesn t like trunc mor trunc didn t like morse he didn t like his voice for some reason but erm i enjoy trunc l trunc cos we lived erm in anon type place before we came here and i ve worked in anon type place
1	oh right
1	and erm i look for the bits of anon type place unclear that we know unclear
1	yes
1	vocal desc laugh and that that makes it fun
1	yeah and that really does make it fun i mean in the same way i went to school in anon type place eventually and they did the eddie shoestring series from anon type place
1	oh right pause dur short oh
1	and i mean that s a long time ago and that was all around anon type place at all places i knew and there s that wonderful feeling of you re actually involved in it because you know the places so well i walked down you know anon type place every day or whatever
1	yes yes yes
1	erm and so there is that lovely feeling
1	yes
1	but tell me about anon type place then tell me about erm your work cos
1	right well i went to anon type place because i was i was working in anon type place and then vocal desc cough trunc intere trunc got interested in cleft palate
1	oh right
1	and there was a erm well anon type place was a centre of excellence for that so i i applied for a job there and erm it was very interesting working in cleft palate though thing was there s well the whole job was just too huge for one person to do and we were terribly terribly underfunded erm for speech and language therapy and erm yeah i was pulled in the direction of cleft palate but also neurology neurosurgery elderly paediatrics
1	right
1	it was it was impossible and looking back it it you know i i find it erm difficult really to see how i actually got through it all vocal desc laugh
1	yes yes of course yes of course
1	it was but anyway the i tried to give the cleft palate priority erm because i was working with a a surgeon who was very very eminent and did research and and erm that involved me as well to an extent but it it was it was quite hard but being in anon type place i just loved i just loved going out at lunchtime if i had the time to just walk through the streets and and look at the architecture and everything it was it was really beautiful
1	yes
1	we lived in a village outside anon type place er seven or eight miles out near anon type place
1	right
1	and erm so travelling in and out was was quite difficult anon type place traffic is dreadful
1	yes it s like anon type place i mean we ve just been to anon type place for the weekend and oh my goodness the traffic is a problem and we decided vocal desc laugh the hotel we usually stay in has got so expensive cos they ve had a refit and so anon nametype m type name and i decided to to stay outside and then that s a problem cos you ve got to keep getting in all the time
1	oh yes
1	erm but we went to some really good lectures erm the unclear erm it was really really good erm so we enjoyed that but getting back to anon type place then so the question i d like to ask you about cleft palate erm how did you manage obviously there s so much surgery involved with cleft palate so obviously you ve got to wait until the end and the surgery s be done been done so you can start working with the patient on their speech
1	well erm not exactly because you would attend the combined cleft clinic
1	right
1	erm where there was a surgeon and maybe an orthodontist you know
1	right
1	erm and others involved in the care and in fact i would see erm the moms and erm just pause dur short on their first the baby s first admission just to say hello who who i am and as a the surgeon would have explained what was gonna happen pause dur short erm but with this surgery the recent surgery much many of the children had normal speech
1	right
1	it was fantastic but i my job was to monitor that
1	right yes
1	and if there was any sign that any more input was needed
1	right
1	erm at a certain stage then i would i would be involved not personally necessarily because erm the anon type place hospitals covered a wide wide area including anon type place at that time
1	oh unclear yes
1	so i would contact the local speech and language therapists and ask them to do some work with a child if necessary pause dur short erm but the results erm were very much better in the later years i worked there for ten years in the early years there was a type of surgery which erm left a very good result as far as parents was concerned but less good speech results
1	right yeah
1	we did some some research and looked at that and it was quite clear that that was not the way to proceed
1	no
1	and so the surgeon erm pause dur short worked erm very early in repairing the cleft
1	right right
1	so the child had a normal anatomy to use as speech developed
1	yes yeah yeah oh erm i suppose the the the most vital part of it all and i used to work on ents years ago
1	oh did you
1	yeah it s closing up the hole in the cleft isn t it
1	yes
1	so the the the whistling and the noise isn t isn t coming down through through the opening
1	yes yes
1	erm and i always thought and also then obviously food gets inhaled and it it it must be a terrible thing to have
1	yes it was and the the the feeding is a real problem for some children
1	yes
1	there are various teats as you probably know
1	yes yes
1	various ones developed for for cleft children but erm the surgeon i worked with was closing the front of the cleft very very early
1	right
1	so the child would have a normal hard palate to press the the tongue tip against unclear
1	right yes
1	erm they used to make plates to put into unclear sometimes didn t they to close erm the front palate
1	yes yes
1	but i don t know i i m now very out of date because it s so it s ten years since i retired and it s pause dur short vocal desc sigh oh a very long much longer time since i had any contact with cleft
1	yeah yes yeah and so you went on after that to do erm a more general erm pause dur short you know stroke victims and that that type of
1	yes i i when i came here to anon type place erm vocal desc cough i came to anon type place erm and worked here for ten years er because i wanted to do some management
1	right yeah oh right
1	so i managed as speech therapist there in anon type place and that limited erm my own clinical work
1	absolutely yeah
1	but i was expected to do fifty percent clinical work which is i mean sheer impossibility
1	yes i can understand that
1	erm but anyway i did keep up a little bit of cleft work but mainly worked in community hospitals
1	right
1	with elderly people
1	right
1	but they re not necessarily elderly people some were people with younger people with voice problems
1	right
1	erm and well anyhow the head injuries like that unclear ongoing rehab
1	yes yes yes
1	so in in a way it was a good thing that i had to keep up my my clinical work because after ten years i d felt i d had enough of working as a manager because the budgets were getting tighter and we were expected to do more with less basically and of course the situation s got much much worse since i left
1	yes oh yes
1	erm pause dur short anyway i wanted to work part time partly because i wanted to spend some time with my husband
1	yes yes unclear
1	he had been retired vocal desc cough oh a very long time and also my mother was ninety living in anon type place so we decided to go back to anon type place
1	right right ah
1	and i got a part time job in community hospitals
1	oh
1	and i worked there for eight years and it was lovely i worked three days a week
1	yes
1	they gave me a day for mom pause dur short and a long weekend so we could enjoy
1	yes
1	and i i just loved driving around and i loved vocal desc cough meeting the people in community hospitals
1	yes
1	and after being a manager i really relished the erm clinical again
1	yeah i can see that you did because as soon as you started talking about it your face lit up vocal desc laugh and it was like oh this is the best thing i ve ever done was it the best thing you ve ever done
1	vocal desc laugh yes erm i don t know i enjoyed the challenge of the management and i i think i achieved a lot well it was trunc im trunc imposed the changes were imposed
1	yes yes
1	but we we went along with them and did them and i think ended up with quite a good service
1	great
1	which then pause dur short got cut and they d broken up
1	ah yes
1	and anyway that s unclear but yes i think i became a better clinical therapist in a way having been a manager
1	yes
1	it made me think differently
1	yes
1	erm i always thought value for money when trunc i trunc after being a a manager er and doing my clinical work you know unclear if i d unclear would it have been worthwhile pause dur short erm which made me in a way more objective and i was more easily able to manage a a pretty impossible caseload because of that
1	yes
1	erm and i think people also because i was then older pause dur short erm they enjoyed relating to somebody older who had life experience because so many of them would say oh wow she was such a sweet young girl you know unclear vocal desc laugh therapist
1	vocal desc laugh yes yes
1	but she was so young you know i think the young therapists are remarkably mature when i compare myself eh with them when i was that age they are amazing people and erm and very academic these days
1	yes
1	but i think being older helped also in you know when you re relating to to the families as you as you do and to carers at residential nursing homes
1	mm yes
1	they have a bit more respect for you cos you re older and you ve obviously seen life
1	absolutely
1	and i suppose you have more confidence as well
1	well that s right that s right i mean the confidence only comes with experience
1	yes
1	i mean it s it s erm it s it s like you go to a young doctor and erm he hasn t really learned the tricks of the trade yet and they re i mean vocal desc laugh there are in in all walks of life ways of doing things
1	yes
1	erm and erm you know er i just changed from a very young doctor to an older doctor erm because erm ah i my erm my er care was mismanaged to such an extent that we lost our erm our private medical insurance
1	oh
1	erm i was given a a a drug that gave me a erm stroke and tia erm just a small stroke you know
1	mm
1	erm but i did i did on two occasions i reported speech erm i i couldn t think of the right words and also my speech was slurred and erm i erm i reported it oh you know given unclear i think it s a bit slurry my speech oh he said oh no no give it another go and i i did and then i had the stroke and then erm and then erm we were anon nametype m type name was in the process of retiring and we were leaving the company scheme after thirty thirty five years the company erm medical insurance scheme and we were going on to somebody else and erm my doctor i had the stroke the the the erm the actual scheme came into effect on one day erm and it was the day erm before i had the stroke but she insisted that i d had it earlier and he put it down and therefore that was the end of my insurance and he couldn t see that from a humanitarian purpose but an elder doctor would have said when did you have the stroke would ve taken my word for it and er but it made a huge difference and that was it so now i can t have private health insurance
1	mm
1	and so but but there s been lots and lots of mistakes in that regard there ve been so many mistakes with that surgery that i couldn t stand it any longer and it was more stressful going to them so now i ve booked in with another doctor who well unfortunately i saw him for the first time last week and he s okay he s much older i i didn t choose him they they they won t let you choose
1	oh yeah
1	i wanted a female actually i thought it d be much better at my age if i see a lady doctor i mean it d be much better but they wouldn t anyway there you go
1	mm
1	erm vocal desc laugh and so we go on you know
1	yes
1	but erm it it s just erm yes it s it s
1	that s a really awful experience you just had
1	erm just interesting what you said about value for money and also the two aspects of that and the way your face brightened up when you were saying erm about that because in the last two years running the gallery was the best thing that i ever did
1	oh was it
1	and every time anyone asks me about it i brighten up and say unclear it was the best thing i ever did and value for money was key point because if people were coming in to buy art which they did erm i i made sure that the artists didn t ask unrealistic prices for them for two reasons really one that you want the artists to sell and they re not famous so they re not gonna get a huge amount for it and secondly the the member of the public can come at the shop and say great i bought a piece of original art and it didn t cost me that much and that s such a wonderful thing
1	yes mm mm yes
1	so that s what keeps people coming back keeps the artists coming back and keeps the erm buyers coming back
1	yes
1	so there you are but i mean they used to unclear very interesting picture up there
1	oh
1	was that something that you did
1	no no that was my mother s actually
1	oh
1	erm it was always in her lounge
1	right
1	and erm when she died i said i d really love that and it i think it goes rather well in here with the with the dark beams and other things
1	oh it does definitely
1	erm i just i just love it i love paintings and pictures which are not too definite and cos you can keep looking at them and see different things unclear
1	yes absolutely well unclear the horizon and you re looking towards the horizon and i was listening to a video by erm my i i go to anon type place on a monday for erm an art course and there was one by someone called anon nametype f type name who s really quite good i didn t realise i saw her website last night and she was talking about horizons and how everybody likes horizons and looking towards them because everybody wants to look into the future and be elevated by what they see and imagine what s beyond that side
1	oh yes yes yes yes
1	and it sort of it s sort of romantic version erm those do you think they were unclear hanging on those
1	i think they must have been unclear but they re just just there i suppose
1	yes yes unclear take down unclear away or something
1	yes
1	it s a nice isolated scene
1	yes
1	it s the sort of scene you get over the unclear talking from anon type place to anon type place it s that sort of thing
1	yes yeah
1	in the anon type place there is a river unclear which is wonderful
1	yes
1	so erm so what now now you re retired then anon nametype f type name what are your hobbies here
1	i don t have too many hobbies i m afraid erm i did go to an art group well it was a class unclear
1	right
1	er our teacher was lovely and he but he was a commercial artist and he got too much work which was lovely for him
1	right good for him yeah
1	erm and then we continued to meet as a group but to be honest i never wanted to vocal desc laugh to do any painting
1	really
1	no it didn t a lot of them would say oh i can t wait to get going with the painting
1	right
1	i just didn t feel like that i think perhaps although i did one or two things which i was amazed at
1	yeah
1	erm i i m not artistic really i don t have a gift for it and i think i m always a little bit worried about wasting time and being dissatisfied with what i ve done
1	well yes it putting yourself in the right situation for it er anon nametype f type name teaches completely differently to anyone i ve ever met erm what she does is she gives you exercises to do and that sounds really boring erm for me if if someone had told me that i would never have gone to the class right
1	no yeah
1	it s very hard to explain she s very insidious vocal desc laugh in her ways of getting you to do things and you don t realise that you re doing them you see
1	yes right
1	so erm she showed us a picture last week of a of erm well several erm pictures of of the new york erm skyline the chicago skyline and they were all in silhouette so they were just black and she asked us using a rigger and a flat brush to erm gave us a demonstration she does a demonstration to everyone very very simple to just try some brushstrokes with these brushes to make this erm skyline or make a skyline up
1	mm
1	well honestly it it i mean anon nametype m type name says to me you can sell that he said it s so good you could sell it nice unclear it was an exercise erm and erm but unclear were producing things they could sell just with these two brushes by doing things not planning just letting it happen
1	no oh
1	and erm she paints horizon pictures but it s very much it s very similar to the atmospheric work in that painting up on the wall where you ve got the sky and and so on so you might enjoy that class
1	vocal desc laugh yes i don t think i ll go
1	unclear you don t unclear
1	no i i came to the conclusion that really i like being with people
1	yeah
1	when i go to an art class i mean you have unclear but basically it s not chatting i like talking
1	yes
1	vocal desc laugh unclear
1	oh it s lovely to talk to you it really is and i i actually approached the library long before i got interested in this i approached the library in anon type place and asked them if erm if i could run the art of conversation classes and erm what we would do is just sit down and choose a topic or several topics depending on which one wore out the quickest and talk about it because there were an awful lot of people around who want to have a conversation but pause dur short when you re in a a partnership for a long time you sort of almost become the other person you were actually thinking what they re thinking and you actually don t have as good a conversation as you might do with a stranger which is obvious really you don t know the stranger do you
1	mm yes yes yes
1	so i wanted to start it and erm they say well we we do this knitting and nattering
1	oh
1	and i said no it s not it s not gossip vocal desc laugh what we re talking about is we might actually discuss erm for instance what s going on at the conservative conference or talk about women priests in the church or my goodness anything
1	mm
1	but they just couldn t seem to and they said would you be charging for this and i said well obviously i d have to ask people for the money in order us to pay for the room i can t just you know so i would do it free but so i was thinking about that but no erm they said well we we ll put it on the board with the friends of the library but when i thought they were doing origami and knitting and nattering i said no i want to raise the game a bit vocal desc laugh and talk about something else so erm
1	yeah
1	it did it fell on stony ground
1	yes well what i do i have quite a lot of friends and i seemed to have filled vocal desc cough the diary with you know meeting one or two the one i go for a walk with and one i and couple i meet for coffee
1	yes ah yes
1	and unclear i suppose unclear my other interest apart from gardening and stuff
1	yes getting things done
1	yes erm pause dur short and and also i want to be free to to go out with unclear say it s a lovely day or something
1	yes of course that s it
1	erm so i don t want to to tie myself down too much
1	no
1	erm i do go to keep fit on a friday morning
1	right
1	i ve been away so i haven t been for a while but that is quite important i suppose
1	when do you do that then anon nametype f type name
1	i go to anon type place church hall
1	oh yes i went for a couple of weeks the dancing to music thing
1	well it s very dancey isn t it
1	yes it is yes
1	yes
1	and i kept going the wrong way so i had to stop vocal desc laugh
1	oh well i do all the time and and some of us do perennially perpetually
1	yes
1	erm but anon nametype f type name is so nice
1	yes she is she s very nice
1	i i like the fact that it s on in the morning you see because the one i went to moved to the afternoon
1	yes
1	and although it was a better workout it was somebody called anon nametype f type name she does quite a lot of erm classes
1	oh right
1	i don t i didn t like having to keep myself sort of relatively inactive in the morning to conserve my energy for the afternoon
1	oh right
1	cos i do have limited energy
1	yes i well we all do when we get older
1	yes
1	i mean we all do yeah
1	so this one is fine it s at ten well you know ten o clock on a friday
1	yeah ten o clock yes
1	and erm yeah we all i think we all do it in our own way and have our own standard
1	yes yes well i joined when i left the shop but then i but then i thought i i did try but i was going the wrong way so often and and there is a class that i really like to unclear
1	uhu
1	which is in the afternoon again i m not unclear afternoons either i mean it s in the afternoon and erm it s it s a lot of dancing it s a lot of it but i do want to do dancing you see
1	uhu
1	erm but erm i ve never been very good at dancing as a team member i seem to go in the opposite direction a bit like my painting vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i m not a team player i don t think i m an individual and unfortunately you know that comes with its limitations erm
1	yes
1	and so i i did pay for the oh i paid for a long session with her long sessions with her erm but unfortunately erm and i paid for the keep fit society or whatever it was
1	mm
1	but erm i had to pull out erm at the time i was i was i was ill for three or four weeks with with dizziness and then i just said oh unclear anymore so that was that erm all very amicable
1	mm
1	but it s a nice group isn t it
1	it is they re very friendly and my other interest of course is is the church
1	oh right
1	i m vocal desc laugh i m very active
1	oh tell me about anon type place is it st pause dur short george s anon type place
1	yes
1	yes
1	yes well erm i don t i i said i didn t want to belong to the unclear church council i ve done that elsewhere and it all seems very intensive here
1	oh right
1	they re very much delegated to them by by the vicar who i have a great deal of respect for pause dur short erm pause dur short i go to er the home group
1	right
1	which is only monthly and i m in prayer circle which means you get requests for prayers emailed through to pray for the people
1	right oh right oh
1	it s very good actually
1	i hadn t thought of doing praying by email before vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well it used to be that you ve you ve you were in a chain and you phoned but it was when everybody got email there s one person in the chain who doesn t have email so she has to be phoned
1	oh did you email
1	but it does mean that everybody gets the prayer request simultaneously or you know unclear they switch on
1	yes yeah
1	and if if you re away it doesn t matter too cos you know the others are doing it anyway
1	yes yeah
1	but that is something which is is tremendous and it actually means that i do pray every day and not just when i have a bit of time
1	yes i know
1	and erm pause dur short so that is good erm for for many reasons and also on a sunday occasionally erm i m part of the prayer ministry team which means that if somebody wants a prayer at the service you pray with them like a standard prayer
1	yes right
1	erm pause dur short and otherwise oh yes the other thing is that i order the bible reading fellowship booklets on behalf of the church
1	oh right
1	you ve heard of them i m sure vocal desc laugh unclear parts
1	erm yes i have yes i think so yes
1	yes and they re still going strong
1	are they oh right
1	and that was that is something i do
1	yeah yeah
1	but erm pause dur short otherwise i just turn up and i i sometimes have helped with the with the decoration of the church but i m not very flower arranging erm expert you know
1	sort of person
1	i like to stick them in a vase and enjoy them
1	they look lovely in that vase i d i d love to get er a sketchpad now not even a pad or sketch it but just blob on some different you know just blob on some different colours there very sort of unclear and erm
1	yes they are lovely aren t they
1	they re gorgeous and of course you ve got the brush strokes you can see the brush strokes can t you unclear
1	yes
1	well i should have a go at that unclear
1	well i might just take a photo of them and then when i when i can i ll erm paint them
1	yeah and the stems are rather nice because unclear a bit distorted in that vase aren t they because it s so curved
1	yes yes
1	well it s a rose pink colour it s it s amazing it s really nice
1	yes
1	erm so erm we i i don t really remember it i don t know whether it s pause dur short do you remember a fashion show being staged in anon type place church years ago
1	no i don t think i was here then
1	well there was a young unclear from anon type place hospital and erm pause dur short it was all trunc trad trunc she was she ran a christian group at anon type place and and i used to go erm years ago and erm i m sure she was involved in it and and that s how i got the invitation and they they actually put erm it was when they had the pews they actually put boards all across the top of the pews pause dur short and the models walked all over them over the pews
1	oh unclear
1	and i remember thinking at the time pause dur short this is a bit strange for a church and they were selling you know i m i m terribly mindful of i mean we re talking about pause dur short erm pause dur short unclear vocal desc cough seventy eight erm nineteen eighty early nineteen eighty we re talking pause dur short and i remember you know what jesus said about the moneylenders and and transactions going on in church of course nobody takes any notice about that now we ve got we ve got cafes we ve got erm gift shops and all unclear
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	i can t believe it how how the church as an institution has divorced itself from christianity and i find that very hard to to to take on board pause dur short erm and yeah so yes i was i remember being absolutely amazed and i went to it was a very nice erm i think maybe a lot of these erm items had been made locally erm i bought a skirt which i wore for a long time a patchwork skirt which was very nice but i i often say to my husband unclear he said do you really think that they would have allowed have allowed that to happen at anon type place erm because the other thing too about anon type place church was er just very briefly trunc be trunc i m sure you ve had enough by now but erm just very briefly
1	it s very interesting vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well erm my husband and i met twenty one years ago
1	oh yes
1	and erm we were both erm you know quite mature by then and er he and his parents had lived in this area for years and he d been an altar boy erm for years at anon type place church
1	uhu
1	and erm he erm pause dur short we were we were living in anon type place erm and erm we were going to get married and and he said well i d like to get married at anon type place church erm although i haven t been because i m you know er well he used to go to the eight o clock quite rightly but he hadn t been for a while
1	mm
1	and it was during the interregnum and we rang up and the secretary told me there was no chance we could get married at anon type place church i thought unclear when i thought think of the time after my mum died and and erm for four years i unclear to my father while he was vicar of anon type place and i had to i was nursing full time unclear vocal desc laugh and i was cleaning the house making all the coffee for taking all the unclear over the phone letting the people out in the hospital and having the undertaker ring me up when i got home for four years i don t know how i survived
1	goodness me
1	and then and and you know and then they weren t even marrying me at anon type place church and i i plus i didn t have the fortitude to explain to her a bit about my life it just made me so totally angry and i thought that is typical of bureaucracy and not only in the church but in the nhs in everywhere i mean yesterday we went to have for a meal and we could only eat so much and we could only drink coffee for this special price and in the end anon nametype m type name and i didn t have anything any of this special price food which unclear be eight pounds a head it s just bureaucracy gone mad so we sat down and ate this meal and the thing the meal which was just two small meals came to seventeen pounds and and erm it was only in a garden centre oh but you ve got to have this this and this and if you deviate you ve got to pay the full price
1	oh
1	and it was just like that and i thought where is bureaucracy it s gone completely mad in some cases
1	well it s a good thing my husband isn t here because vocal desc laugh i we had a similar well not as extreme erm an experience about getting married as you did
1	vocal desc laugh yeah
1	but i d lived in this village in in erm pause dur short anon type place for some time and i d been secretary of the pcc i d done the gift unclear returns i ve been a bell ringer i ve cleaned the church
1	yes yes you ve done a lot
1	came to getting married pause dur short and we went to see the vicar and he said well i m afraid cos anon nametype m type name had been divorced unclear before we couldn t do it
1	oh right yes yeah
1	and that s why i wrote to the bishop
1	right
1	and erm i felt well well i don t know vocal desc laugh i m not bothered how how it s done we ll go and go to a registry office and we ll have a service blessing afterwards which we did
1	yes
1	and the vicar unclear everybody unclear their services free and we had a unclear
1	yeah sounds lovely
1	everybody did all they could to make it nice but anon nametype m type name has never got over the fact fact
1	yes
1	with all my background
1	exactly
1	erm we couldn t get married in church
1	no exactly well my father when he was vicar of anon type place he he made it his business to marry divorced people i mean he was it wasn t really then the thing to do but he had lots and lots of people who came in and he he always married them
1	mm
1	and erm it was just the way he felt about it
1	well i m sure he s right because in fact anon nametype m type name pause dur short first wife left him
1	right so
1	and okay they probably he was at fault to some extent but how on earth can clergy gauge whose fault it was
1	exactly no exactly you can t
1	no
1	and it it s like people look at you in life i mean as you get older erm and you re retired and they don t know that you ve been a brilliant speech therapist in your life they don t know that i actually have written three plays and been to drama school i ve been a you know i ve got three professional qualifications
1	unclear wide ranging life haven t you
1	yes well it was because i was on my own for so long we didn t get married until our mid forties you see so erm it s because i ve been on my own for so long and i thought well blow it i read a book once called anybody can do anything and erm it was about this girl vocal desc laugh was quite a crazy book i can t really remember but she would take a job and then she would erm decide well that s not really interesting i ll do something else and she d just go on and on until she got bigger and better jobs basically well i wasn t really working towards that plan but things tend to happen to me in my life good things and very bad things like everybody but erm pause dur short it it did enable me to erm to try a few things out and erm you know i ve had my you know i ve had my highs and i ve had my lows if you have very big highs you do get very big lows pause dur short i was just reading nicholas parsons biography
1	oh really
1	and erm he started out at clydebank as an engineer because his parents just didn t want him to go on stage at all his parents were so against it and he said he writes a bit about the basic way he was treated by the other men of course he had a very posh accent and everything
1	mm
1	and erm he said you know erm pause dur short he got on well in the theatre and on the radio because he developed he felt that after clydebank vocal desc laugh he could do anything
1	vocal desc laugh
1	the way he was reared and the way he was treated and i mean and he still passed his engineering exams he still did a good job but he went on to to be an actor and all the time he was doing it he was having small parts on the radio and unclear still keeping going but he said that was the basis of his
1	mm
1	so there you are
1	interesting
1	so erm is there anything else you d like to say vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh we ve done quite well
1	do you think we ve finished
1	is it fifty minutes
1	er hang on forty five oh we ve really done really well haven t we
1	well it hasn t been an effort vocal desc laugh
1	no how good vocal desc laugh unclear so i ll pause recording vocal desc misc and press red button
1	yeah erm i hadn t it s not something i d really thought about until my friend anon nametype f type name was running a vegetarian caf in in pause dur short erm scarborough for quite a while
1	oh yeah
1	and so they had some of their dishes all of their dishes were vegetarian but some of their dishes
1	some of them were
1	when they had v on their menu it meant vegan rather than vegetarian
1	right yeah yeah
1	erm and they had gluten free stuff and and so on erm and she actually made she made a vegan chocolate cake pause dur short which was
1	right
1	much in demand you know she d make it to order for birthday parties and things
1	mm
1	because if you are a vegan it must be very difficult
1	mm
1	to actually er get stuff
1	yeah pause dur short yes a festive vegan is almost an oxymoron isn t it
1	mm mm
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	mm there was a programme erm well it was a horizon pause dur short about three weeks ago
1	uhu
1	but it was actually two consecutive days i think
1	mm
1	or at least two in one week erm about meat eating did you see it
1	no i didn t
1	erm it was the first one was pause dur short looking at the effects on health and the second one was looking at the effects on the environment
1	uhu pause dur short ah mm
1	and to me it was very impressive because
1	i heard about this
1	it wasn t saying pause dur short x y z it was talking to lots of different people who have done different studies and some of them contradicted each other and and you know
1	mm pause dur long right
1	and quite a lot of it was well actually we don t we re not quite sure about this yet
1	right
1	but the general consensus was pause dur short the planet would be better if more people ate more vegetables and unclear fewer unclear less meat
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	and most people s health would be better if they ate less meat than they do
1	yeah
1	in in developed countries
1	it s a very inefficient way of feeding your population
1	yes
1	to feed them meat
1	erm and i pause dur short what shocked me was pause dur short what he was talking about as an average erm amount of meat consumed by british men in a you know and so on
1	mm hm
1	and i was looking at it and thinking i eat at least that much
1	uhu
1	and i m not a man
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	you know pause dur short and i was talking to my mum and saying pause dur short if i m cooking for myself i don t usually bother with potatoes i ll do two veg or sometimes even three veg and a larger portion of meat
1	yeah
1	than one perhaps otherwise would have therefore which is partly to compensate for the lack of potatoes and partly because you can t buy a joint for one
1	right
1	you know vocal desc laugh
1	yes yes yeah
1	erm and you know i really clearly am eating too much pause dur short erm so it s made me think but i like fish
1	mm
1	and i like vegetarian food so it is a bit silly to eat as much meat as i do pause dur short unclear that unclear i need to try and pause dur short erm plan things a bit better pause dur short erm pause dur long but it left
1	you mentioning fish i sorry i think it was the day you moved into this house and i phoned you
1	mm
1	and a rather breathless anon nametype f type name picked up the phone because you d just walked in the door with a large packet of fish and chips vocal desc laugh in your hand do you remember that
1	mm i don t often eat fish and chips
1	right but pause dur short it is a suddenly it it d been a right day for fish and chips obviously
1	mm yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short i remember it now you say it i d forgotten no i was i it left me with a lot of questions because he was pause dur short they were differentiating between processed meat pause dur short red meat and pause dur short white meat ie chicken
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short particularly in terms of health more than environment erm pause dur short and he kept going pause dur short processed meat for example bacon and sausage and i m thinking well okay what about corned beef where does where does that fit and
1	mm yeah
1	and you know erm if you buy pause dur short i quite often buy stuff from the er delicatessen counter in the supermarket for my sandwiches
1	yeah
1	and pause dur short okay he was clear about ham but if i m buying cold roast pork sliced from the delicatessen is that processed or is it red meat do you know what i mean cos it s
1	yeah yeah
1	ie would it be better for me to roast a joint of pork and use some of it use the fag end for my sandwiches or or is it just the same as what i m buying and and those kind of questions obviously just weren t answered at all
1	right
1	erm pause dur short and not and where does where do things like duck and turkey fit it was only talking about chicken
1	mm
1	in contrast to beef pork and lamb
1	right
1	i would imagine
1	also it s pause dur short processed meat ham i mean if you pause dur short a ham in its simplest state is pause dur short a piece of dead pig that you hang up pause dur short in your hut for two years
1	mm vocal desc laugh
1	and then eat
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short it it s not er most ham you would certainly buy in a supermarket there s nothing like that at all pause dur short it s been processed here and accelerated there and so on
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	but er they pause dur short air dried cured pause dur short lump of ham has is that really processed or not
1	i don t know
1	unclear you know i m
1	mm
1	you really do just hang it up and leave it there for a erm eighteen months or so
1	well again you know so if you re buying pause dur short meat from a farm shop for example pause dur short how does that fit into the pause dur short the whole
1	right
1	so yes it so it was looking at very general categorisations and making some general suggestions and so on but it wasn t answering those kind of detailed questions
1	but then fair enough unclear
1	unclear turned out to do so yeah fine
1	fine well
1	but if you re actually think of changing your diet you actually need to know the answer to those kind of questions
1	yeah right
1	mm cos pause dur short i remember pause dur short the b and b that i used to go to near anon type place pause dur short they did a cooked breakfast every morning and pause dur short that was all pause dur short you know free range eggs and and the bacon was from some specialist farm nearby and you know it pause dur short would that be better bacon or is all bacon bad
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know pause dur long
1	yes and another aspect of that that would interest me pause dur short i i very seldom eat pause dur short erm pause dur short sort of vegetarian meat you know trunc so trunc sausage vegetarian sausages
1	mm yeah yeah
1	and things like that pause dur short but i m gonna how much effort goes into producing that is it pause dur short a very pause dur short energy intensive process to
1	well
1	move from a soya bean
1	mm
1	to something that looks like a sausage
1	they didn t look at that they when when they were looking at the environment they were mostly looking at they were looking at pause dur short the environmental impact of pause dur short beef pause dur short well er mutton pork and chicken
1	mm hm
1	erm really and pause dur short as he said he was not looking at things from a an animal rights point of view
1	no no
1	erm because actually the most pause dur short the smallest carbon footprint was for chickens which were being raised in a big shed
1	vocal desc laugh
1	not all squashed together
1	mm
1	they had a bit of unclear legroom unclear
1	okay
1	or well they were they were walking around
1	mm
1	but they were still very very concentrated and you know
1	mm mm
1	erm pause dur short but it was it was i can t remember the figures now obviously but it was massively better than than any of the others
1	yeah
1	and as you would expect beef was the worst lamb was nearly as bad pork was substantially less and chicken was massively less
1	mm yep pause dur long
1	but at one point pause dur short he did pause dur short compare i think he did compare a sausage and a vegetarian sausage but i think it was on the health thing and that actually there wasn t a significant difference between them on whatever they were looking at at that point
1	mm mm mm
1	which could have been saturated fats or something like that you know
1	yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur long but pause dur short clearly not a simple question each he took us to a pause dur short a beef farm if that s the right word
1	mm
1	in in america where you know there s not a blade of grass in sight pause dur short they re being fed erm cereals
1	yeah uhu
1	erm and kept in pause dur short i mean they re not sort of standing in rows but they re not exactly gambling free through the fields or anything
1	yeah vocal desc laugh right
1	erm pause dur short and er pause dur short that was actually pause dur short a lower carbon footprint
1	mm
1	a lot lower
1	mm
1	than having them wandering about
1	ah
1	because they were pause dur short they fattened fast they reached the point when they would be slaughtered much faster
1	yeah yep
1	erm so they weren t pause dur short burping methane into the atmosphere for for four years it was eighteen months that sort of difference you know
1	right right
1	erm but on the other hand if you look at then there s other things that you re looking at so pause dur short it depends what you what your focus is
1	mm yeah yeah
1	and what your priorities are
1	yes
1	as to what you actually think is good pause dur short and obviously those particular because they re in america and there s no legislation there about antibiotics they re crammed with antibiotics
1	oh yes yeah
1	which of course is an issue for us
1	right pause dur short mm
1	and the the pause dur short beef producers answer to that question was pause dur short more or less well there s no evidence that it s doing any harm so we might as well do it you know vocal desc laugh rather than pause dur short i mean you sort of thought vocal desc misc pause dur short and there s certainly evidence that antibiotics that overuse of antibiotics in the world is doing harm
1	yeah absolutely
1	erm but
1	quite right pause dur long yes the particularly the food standards in the united states is a big pause dur short question at the moment in europe isn t it because
1	mm
1	there were the negotiations going on about the free trade area between north america
1	mm
1	and the eu pause dur short and that may be a good idea or not but if it a lot of people are saying and i think with great justification if it means the consequence of that treaty that erm pause dur short food raised to american standards is in is pause dur short erm cannot be stopped from being imported into the european union and so on then then that is a problem for a lot of people
1	well pause dur short i just i don t see how you could possibly justify that on any kind of legal basis but if you know if if european farmers are not allowed to do x then anybody selling within that area shouldn t be allowed to do x that s just to me that s just completely clear there vocal desc laugh isn t any issue about that and if americans want to conform to our standards they bloody well you know on to sell they re gonna have to conform to our standards pause dur short tough
1	well yes yeah pause dur short i think i personally would agree with you completely but erm pause dur short if pause dur short the big picture is that the european union will be a lot more prosperous if there is a lot more transatlantic trade and so on and if the us administration insists that that erm that opening up the market to food produce to us standards is part of a treaty
1	mm
1	then what do you do i mean i would say pause dur short and you say
1	no
1	no but
1	call their bluff
1	yeah
1	cos it s time they learnt that they can t bully the rest of the world
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i mean the fact is pause dur short that vocal desc sigh pause dur long we do accept goods produced in sweatshops and so on that shouldn t be you know there s not there s already a lot of question marks and i i just think you can t have those sort of double standards that s just so hypocritical we re saying that these are the only acceptable standards then we shouldn t be be allowing anything to be bought or sold that hasn t been
1	mm
1	produced according to those standards but yeah we do do it with other things
1	yeah pause dur short yep pause dur long mm very good
1	good pause dur long ah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah i mean i ve yeah it s sort of
1	yeah mm
1	it s not my normal back problem it s a pull here and that is exactly what i got the last time i tried to do that
1	uhu unclear mhm unclear
1	erm which is trunc wor trunc worrying because that means i ve actually pulled something that i don t normally pull i think it s probably a particular muscle
1	mm
1	but i m not well enough grounded in vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	erm physiology to be sure about that one
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	i think sorry to be pause dur short erm pause dur short nattery about this i think it would be a really good idea if you went and checked your e ticket now before we sat down and had a nice long slow dessert erm pause dur short because
1	okay
1	i am quite sure what you did last time was look at the start time say oh it ll be fine if i arrive by such and such a time and it wasn t because they re much stricter about it than you we expected
1	right pause dur long
1	there we go
1	i ll just clear a few of these things mm pause dur long
1	okay
1	what does it say
1	unclear space to unclear check in site
1	mm
1	that s a good bit of mixed english and german isn t it
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	erm is pause dur short nineteen hundred
1	right so you your aiming for six is absolutely fine
1	i was in fact okay i was aiming to get there at eighteen hundred
1	well i mean as you say that sounds completely reasonable it s just that last time you did
1	right
1	did something
1	right
1	that sounded completely reasonable
1	it sounded but yes exactly pause dur short you re quite right but anyway we have now checked it we can now relax as you say pause dur long
1	erm pause dur short i m just recycling i ve just trunc re trunc recycled that cos i didn t think you d really want garlic on the spoon you were using for the dessert
1	vocal desc laugh
1	are you happy with it cold pause dur short because i prefer trunc cr trunc crumble cold
1	mm
1	which is a
1	yeah
1	obviously i can put your portion in a dish and zap it in a microwave
1	no no no no no this is fine
1	right well i m serving some custard and i m sorry my custard s tinned as well because i actually prefer tinned custard to homemade
1	right
1	i looked for some pause dur short you know the supermarkets have custard in the fridge section pause dur short which is nicer than the tinned
1	mm
1	and i couldn t find any at morrisons sainsbury s certainly have it but i wasn t gonna go to sainsbury s just for custard that s
1	right
1	that did strike me just as a little bit we need a spoon you need a spoon
1	yep
1	oh ah pause dur short there you go sir
1	thank you
1	so we ll use that to serve cos it s bigger
1	right
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long and just take as much as you like i mean i know these dishes aren t brilliantly big but you can always have seconds
1	ah
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	oh yes pause dur long i m not gonna argue with my computer but i ve got a message please do not power off or unplug your machine installing update seven of twelve
1	oh
1	now since this is not connected to the internet
1	and there s pause dur short well
1	it hasn t been for some time
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	so where are these updates coming from
1	vocal desc laugh
1	one asks oneself
1	well it s a little bit alarming actually vocal desc laugh i mean obviously there are there are there are always wireless networks in the area but you need a password for them
1	yeah i know
1	which you haven t got so
1	right right
1	and i haven t got cos i ve got a router
1	ah yeah pause dur short oh trunc we trunc i don t think i ve told you any of this story but we had great dramas with anon nametype f type name s computer
1	mm
1	oh i did tell you
1	you did yeah
1	okay yeah
1	is it now fixed
1	mm mm
1	but as you say things like that always happen pause dur short at a point of maximum inconvenience when you really really need it with something specific
1	yeah pause dur short still installing update seven of twelve
1	mm vocal desc laugh
1	i mean i ll just leave it chuntering away to itself unclear
1	well i wondered if it was in the middle of something when you switched it off when you were connected and it thinks it s still doing it yeah
1	yeah well last time last time i had i had it turned on it was connected
1	mm
1	that was yesterday morning
1	but you d think if it was in the middle of a job it would have told you as you tried to switch it off then wouldn t you
1	mm yeah
1	mm
1	mm this is good pause dur short this is very good
1	well as i say i thought if i m going to have to put up with all those brambles i might as well get vocal desc laugh unclear at least i got some benefit
1	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur long
1	mm i mean the only trouble obviously about leaving here at four o clock is you re right in pause dur short nasty traffic all the way at that time but i mean there isn t really anything you can do about that
1	no
1	erm oh obviously it s noticeably worse these last couple of weeks now that the schools have gone back vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	it was it s quite a shock to the system cos you get so used to it
1	to to it not to unclear school and so on yeah yeah
1	well i i ve never really understood this but i find that the traffic gets steadily lighter week by week from easter onwards pause dur short so by the time and okay yes it s very light in the summer holidays but it isn t only for those five weeks or whatever it it has been getting lighter for quite a while and then suddenly wham in september you re back to max again aren t you
1	mm
1	the only explanation i can think of is a lot of people enough people are taking their annual holiday at any time from april to july that the number of trunc touc trunc the total number of cars on the road is is being reduced
1	yeah yeah
1	cos it really you know i don t think it s my imagination pause dur long
1	and ah i don t know i m sure one could trunc mod trunc ah my computer
1	what
1	no no no the screen just went blank sorry but it s still it s still unclear loading unclear to update seven of twelve
1	oh
1	total nonsense
1	mm mm
1	as i m sure people who study traffic and so on could tell us this but it could well be that let s say two percent reduction in the number of cars on the road pause dur short results in a forty percent erm decrease in in the traffic in the in the journey time cos
1	mm yeah
1	if something is just about on the total limit if
1	yes
1	the two percent difference can make maybe an enormous difference
1	that s quite possible yes that would make sense
1	mm
1	mm i had a guy pause dur short in one of my classes in germany who did pause dur short basically worked for what whatever they re called was it n falfa you know the munich fecayers
1	unclear n falfo unclear yeah
1	yeah unclear n falfo unclear pause dur short erm sort of working out the the maximum efficiencent unclear on timetables and god knows what vocal desc laugh
1	right right
1	you know i mean i would say that s not road but erm he was he it had never really struck me until i met him that that was obviously a a real white collar job and he was very bright and needed to be
1	mm mm
1	to do that sort of thing that it s not exactly comparable with mending the roads vocal desc laugh designing traffic systems and so on exactly
1	no it isn t it it it is a very complicated
1	yeah
1	once pause dur short once you sort of pause dur short say right i am a mathematician i will model
1	mm
1	traffic and so on that s erm just the most about the most complicated model as what you can what you can manage as a mathematician pause dur short because there are so many factors and er pause dur short erm pause dur short and you ve got to factor in unknowns like er well an accident or whatever
1	mm
1	or somebody pause dur short on the motorway it s down to one lane and somebody runs out of petrol just there for instance pause dur short and is it worth having pain to have pause dur short two pickup trucks parked by the side of a road
1	mm mm mm
1	and hanging about smoking fags doing absolutely nothing for ninety nine point nine percent of the time but you need two trucks there because if you have two incidents erm and you ve only got one truck erm then you know the whole of the m or the whole of the m or whatever can grind to a halt and
1	yeah
1	and pause dur short from the economic effect of that on the economy of britain could be enormous
1	mm
1	because if you if you ve got thousands of people arriving late for work and so on and so forth and then
1	well and also we transport a lot of stuff on the road i mean that s something that
1	mm mm
1	that anon nametype m type name commented on that when he s been in britain how many lorries there are on the road pause dur short a lot of trunc stuf trunc of which stuff is transported by rail in america apparently
1	mm yeah
1	now i didn t think that america had such a big nail rail nail retwork rail network
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but maybe that s passenger you know i didn t think that people travelled by train so much i thought they did more they did drive more
1	mm
1	but pause dur short i don t know pause dur long and i ve certainly experienced have you watched qi
1	i know it but i
1	mm erm cos it s something in i don t know which what letter they were doing and what they were talking about
1	uhu
1	but there was something where they were talking about this sort of effect where on a motorway where somebody slows down for trunc somethin trunc you know puts the brakes on and they there s this sort of wave effect that goes
1	mm yes
1	that goes a really long way back and you end up
1	yeah
1	all going slowly and thinking when you and there s nothing pause dur short visible
1	right yes
1	is it all and i ve experienced that so many times and thought what were we all slowing down for
1	mm yes yeah yeah installing update eleven of twelve i don t know
1	well he s doing something
1	exactly
1	isn t he how very odd
1	vocal desc laugh
1	don t know what he s doing but he s progressing well
1	well when you get taken over by little green men from mars
1	vocal desc laugh
1	exactly pause dur short it s maybe when it s we ve have installed update twelve of twelve unclear little green man saying we now rule the world coming up on my screen unclear
1	vocal desc laugh possibly let s hope not
1	vocal desc laugh
1	mm pause dur short so i was thinking possibly pause dur short do you prefer tea or coffee after lunch pause dur short sit outside with a cuppa
1	mm yeah i really don t mind whichever pause dur short really really i don t mind so whatever you normally have i ll go with
1	well pause dur short i m gonna be making erm ginger tea for me
1	oh
1	so that doesn t really help
1	no okay erm
1	it really doesn t i m i m it really really really doesn t matter that it s equally easy to make either
1	er pause dur short coffee
1	right
1	shutting down
1	oh right
1	no little green men waving at me
1	oh well excellent vocal desc laugh did it say what it was an update of
1	no
1	vocal desc laugh
1	no
1	well isn t that a bit strange i mean don t they normally tell you
1	well possibly if i had had my eyes on it in the beginning it would have said microsoft update or whatever
1	mm
1	but you know if you said good night go to bed as it were you don t then stare at your computer screen usually you just er
1	yeah
1	er so i said you know go to bed and then glanced at it a couple of minutes later and it was
1	and you hadn t
1	installing updates
1	ever clicked on it to tell it to or is it is yours set up so that it automatically does it
1	it is yes
1	ah right you see mine isn t i would have had to click on whatever it was in the first place
1	yeah
1	erm cos what annoys me and i suppose i don t know any other way they can do it but you go into trunc somet trunc i only go into a programme when i want to use it
1	mm
1	and that s the point to which it says do you want to install an update and well no not right now because i m about to do something
1	i m busy yes exactly
1	erm and so i always say no and then of course i reach a point like i did with the skype where it actually won t work because
1	right yeah
1	i refuse the updates so frequently er but erm presumably a lot of people just do have their computers on with various things open which i find weird
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	mm
1	ah
1	right
1	oh dear
1	ow ow vocal desc laugh
1	ah oh
1	yes but it s not so much the ow it s the fact that it that i can t get it to work that is really really annoying me
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i shall have to stop going on about it because it s quite unconstructive to just keep on tell you how cross i am
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	you know there s a pause dur short this twining s ginger
1	mm
1	is called settling er and i definitely find that that doesn t that if when you whether it s good for my stomach i don t know but it s certainly not bad for it so
1	okay right
1	erm whereas actually even normal tea pause dur short is not brilliant
1	really yeah yeah
1	it s better than coffee but it s still not brilliant
1	yeah yeah pause dur long
1	mm ah pause dur short so pause dur short you ll come to this restaurant again will you
1	most definitely most definitely
1	vocal desc laugh well i find it quite interesting thinking of vegetarian things to cook actually pause dur short you know
1	yeah yes
1	erm and thinking well i m not just going to do bloody cheese on toast vocal desc laugh you know vocal desc laugh
1	right yes vocal desc laugh
1	unclear try and do something try and think of something that i haven t done for you before
1	yeah right no very good indeed
1	so erm pause dur short erm pause dur short and i ve actually got i ve got a couple of colleagues who are vegetarian i mean one of them calls herself vegetarian but she does eat fish as well
1	mm
1	she s one of those erm but i still think even if somebody tells me that pause dur short in some ways it s easier just to cook totally vegetarian
1	yes
1	and the last time she came there were two of them and the other one is completely vegetarian so you know
1	the unclear obvious unclear yeah yes right
1	so pause dur long
1	some time ago we had a er well we invited four friends round for dinner and pause dur short one couple unclear two no were two couples one couple accepted but in a sense very reluctantly not reluctantly in that they didn t want to come but they said erm er but she was allergic to er and der and der and der and der and der and der
1	i mean it does make it difficult i mean you would feel very very awkward wouldn t you
1	and pause dur short right and so pause dur short i said right well you know i m sure we can sort that out you know send me pause dur short er pause dur short send me a list of of of everything which is not possible and i will then devise a menu and then send that back to you for for approval
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short and in fact it was a good job i did because then in my menu there was something which wasn t hadn t been put on the list but to which she was also unclear very very allergic
1	right yeah
1	and so we had to have a revised list and so on erm pause dur short but that er and i took that as a challenge and and
1	mm
1	it was really quite fun but but bloody hard work trying first of all this time to work out erm a menu as it were and and then in fact cooking things which some of which i d never cooked before in my life
1	good
1	erm and pause dur short but i i got my reward as it were because erm pause dur short at the end of the meal she said oh that was absolutely wonderful really enjoyed that and she then told us that this was the first time she d been out to dinner in four years
1	bloody hell
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you see pause dur short i was trunc real trunc well the last my german pen friend you know person that i did exchanges when i was a teenager we stayed in touch for years and years and the last time she came we really didn t get on well at all
1	i remember you didn t
1	and i ended and we haven t communicated since and one of the factors there was she s a trunc veget trunc she had become a vegetarian she didn t bother to tell me before she came
1	no
1	so and she and she she d just say oh well just cook what you re cooking i ll just eat the vegetables well no if you re someone who likes cooking you don t want to do it you feel awful
1	yeah
1	and i and a lot of the things she was doing were making me feel like a bad hostess
1	right yes yes
1	whereas if she d just contacted me beforehand it s not a problem vocal desc laugh
1	no quite
1	you know
1	quite
1	erm pause dur short and the fact is that she was always a bit of a problem with the with you always felt rather bad because she s anorexic pause dur short and i think that s something like being alcoholic that once you re anorexic in a sense you always are
1	mm hm
1	that it s kind of in your system so although she s no longer in the sort of state that she was as a teenager pause dur short she still eats ridiculously small portions
1	right
1	so i mean she s slightly taller than me but she we trunc ke trunc my brother and i calculated the second time she came pause dur short so she d be sixteenish i suppose erm and my mother happened to have a book of calories cos she was at weight watchers at the time
1	right
1	so we knew we we calculated that she was having about seven hundred calories a day six to seven hundred calories a day and as i say she s slightly taller than me so
1	yeah yeah
1	you know and still a teenager so i mean i m not saying she was still growing but you know
1	but well yeah but she was to some extent yeah for sure she s still developing unclear
1	just and pause dur short and okay she got a bit better than that but she was still not somebody who really bothered about food and stuff
1	no
1	it still it it s just awkward when you re the hostess but well maybe it isn t to everybody some people are much more casual about things but it it bothers me i want to get things right
1	and i would i would certainly be annoyed if somebody arrived i mean and when they got here told me that they were you know vegetarian or allergic to gluten or whatever or whatever
1	yeah
1	it s it s just a matter of well common courtesy i would say
1	i would think so yes
1	erm to say so and i mean i ve had cases mostly pause dur short people will say oh yeah no problem but occasionally you sort of say this on the phone i m a vegetarian and there s a sort of stunned silence and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and then you say well erm how about er pause dur short a unclear kaiserspetsley unclear for instance if i m in germany and everybody knows that and everybody knows with that how to cook that and it is vegetarian and so on
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	and you can sort of feel the ah yes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	now sort of you can hear not hear it but feel it coming down the phone somehow
1	right let s take these mugs outside
1	okay
1	i m just gonna if you take your coffee i m just gonna switch that off
1	right
0	ah
0	i dunno like i just pause dur short it s difficult cos i ve had the whole week off pause dur short so it s kind of given i ve i ve literally had like seven days off and given me like a load of kind of pause dur short erm pause dur short like a lack or pause dur short almost caring about it pause dur short really like i haven t really been thinking about
0	mm
0	and i m just a bit worried about tuesdays
0	oh pause dur short yeah
0	yeah cos i ve never been one vocal desc laugh and pause dur short i dunno if i m going to start going to them or just kind of like pause dur short unclear yeah i explained it before unclear
0	i mean if you can if you feel able to
0	yeah exactly
0	no i think you ll be able to do it pause dur short if you pause dur short trunc i trunc if you ve just focused on getting pause dur short not even focusing on pause dur short trying to work at the moment just say it s a challenge for you to get there because it is a moment to be attending
0	mm
0	maybe the next step doing independent work pause dur short you don t have to go above and beyond you don t have to do pause dur short you know a trunc m trunc something pause dur short vocal desc sigh incredible you don t have to produce pause dur short first pause dur short pieces of work you don t have to do that pause dur short it s just about pause dur short cos that s the thing with you cos i don t think you re used to like pause dur short doing the minimum kind of thing you re used to doing really well and wanting to do really well
0	do you do you pause dur short really
0	oh vocal desc sigh it s just confusing really pause dur short dunno pause dur short vocal desc sigh pause dur short i mean cos even when i was like kind of in a better frame of mind i still wanna go to university it s never been like
0	what i wanted to do
0	mm
0	yeah

0	all the years pause dur short like leading up to it i ve never wanted to go to university i ve always thought thought i would be pause dur short completely out of my depth pause dur short vocal desc sigh and pause dur short here we are vocal desc laugh pause dur short so yeah it s just
0	yeah
0	unclear they say unclear pause dur short yeah
0	you re just not sure what you have to do
0	sitting around so much pause dur short like people say it to me all the time like i m a really different pause dur short kind of person
0	in what in what way do they say you re different
0	like you know i ve never pause dur short er they just say like vocal desc sigh pause dur short trunc y trunc i just pause dur short i just speak differently and pause dur short i just act differently and pause dur short react to things differently and pause dur short i m just not trunc an trunc as interested or pause dur short kind of pause dur short i dunno enthusiastic pause dur short or
0	mm
0	i think pause dur short like obviously i think for a lot of trunc peo trunc part of growing up is pause dur short that you get more pause dur short cynical
0	yeah
0	but at the same time pause dur short the way you re feeling right now isn t just down to getting older at all
0	yeah

0	yeah
0	look at that girl pause dur short hating life as much as me vocal desc laugh pause dur short actually vocal desc laugh pause dur short it probably would ve pause dur short no
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	vocal desc sigh
0	unclear yeah unclear
0	but he was trying to pause dur short get people out of the venue pause dur short it s just awful pause dur short i dunno how they survived though the band
0	oh yeah i suppose it that s cos it it was after the concert wasn t
0	you re living the high life
0	no he goes to
0	in the north it s the one to go to like anon type place you have to be very clever anon nametype m type name is a great drummer i m not just saying it cos he s in my band yeah
0	erm the same with anon nametype m type name as well anon nametype m type name is also a brilliant bassist
0	yeah
0	have you ever seen er erm what s it called now i can t remember what one with erm that guy who was batman what s his name
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah of course you can yeah
0	yeah cos he doesn t look anything like
0	yeah yeah so body yeah but face no and anon nametype m type name was going no no no
0	vocal desc laugh
0	quite a common name and er and if and the she said that she unclear her age like what she s been out saying that oh you can t stop at mine any more you need to get a hotel and i m like i ve got no money i really can t afford to unclear to york and a hotel and a night out and
0	yeah
0	why can t you stop at why can t you stop at hers
0	er and then it unclear you unclear there
0	i ve not been in i ve not been since erm they were all
0	is that the one you re unclear gigging unclear
0	yeah
0	i m back i m back
0	friday afternoon anyway
0	right
0	so i m going out saturday night as well
0	have fun
0	i m not flying to france till monday and i m doing nothing for the rest of for the whole weekend so
0	unclear pretty unclear vocal desc laugh pause dur short i ve got unclear you ve drunk some wine as well and i ve had like three quarters of a bottle i think i m eat best eat something
0	yeah yeah
0	but i thought about
0	i loved the film
0	but i love the comic books more
0	not knowing what it s about you d think it was a good film
0	i thought that was unclear unclear i was well i was unclear really like excited at end of that cos
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	the second one is the best one so far
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah i did
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and erm pause dur short futurama used to do a few comics
0	mm
0	i used to read them as well
0	unclear futurama did unclear futurama unclear i used to love it
0	yeah
0	and erm cos the drawings and the animation takes so long whereas cos south park is so basic it doesn t take that long
0	they did erm an episode about trunc bara trunc barack obama the day after it had been like announced
0	unclear
0	as a kid but as an adult
0	formerly chuck s and i was like unclear that s the name yeah sneed s feed and seed formerly chuck s if it was chuck s it d be chuck s suck and fuck yeah and i never got that as a kid cos you wouldn t would ya
0	no vocal desc laugh
0	unclear
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	yeah
0	i saw that
0	and the circle
0	trunc tri trunc erm i say like i ll show you what i ve got i ve got two sabbath t shirts i know exactly who they are i know i know people who like black sabbath that much i ve seen them
0	they re good but i did think erm i didn t think they were like amazing but i the one that i ve got unclear er unclear black sabbath t shirt it s a black sabbath t shirt unclear
0	mm
0	i i love that
0	i love his arrogance
0	yeah that one
0	that s weird feel like even the t shirt unclear vocal desc laugh
0	yeah glorious tits
0	yeah
0	he s on my list
0	cos if you think ryan reynolds is beaut i ve literally fancied him since day
0	with black hair
0	is it really good
0	yeah he s a really funny guy
0	i m terrible at unclear i can t like unclear lie and unclear keep a straight face about summat i have to giggle
0	can t lie like my mum anon nametype m type name and my dad are the only people that can tell i m lying but that s because i touch my nose if i m lying like i don t lie all the time i do touch my nose a lot but
0	i ll watch out for that then
0	but if i m specifically lying i will like go like that
0	i don t know if i still do it now but
0	i ll watch out for it
0	i can unclear read unclear eye contact from lying or not
0	i did vocal desc laugh did i do that no did i
0	i think maybe you are a black woman with a six inch penis
0	yeah it does unclear and i was like what is up with it and i realised i wasn t getting anything off of it and i looked at it and it had unclear right take it out cos you can t just put a roach in you can t like unclear
0	i really would like to smoke with you as well
0	weed you don t get a hangover
0	unclear
0	oh toe unclear that
0	yeah unclear pause dur long got a tv hand unclear vocal desc laugh
0	i don t unclear but i do get drunk quite quick
0	we should i feel like we should
0	i feel like we should as well but
0	unclear i think that stuff like cos obviously you don t go to the same sort of places that i go to
0	he goes to me he goes to me er i says ah my mate anon nametype f type name s coming out he goes you here now i went yeah and he went it s not that fit one is it that er on your band profile something like and i m like yeah it s her vocal desc laugh
0	unclear
0	unclear get it recorded unclear i m guessing
0	yeah if you if you click fit in our conversations and recordings
0	bet you wish you were though
0	i feel so old i ve started to just like ache when i get up and turn and it s like not nice
0	i wanna be eighteen i ve still got unclear i ve got like the maturity of like being like an eighteen year old yeah and i want to be like eighteen again cos if i
0	your body s not saying yeah
0	yeah on twenty three grand a year fuck off
0	unclear tell her exactly what i thought but i d be excluded every week
0	you re mature anyway though aren t ya you re much more mature than me
0	unclear yeah but i m two years older than you well let s say one for now unclear
0	only through like the way you speak
0	no in what way do you think i m cleverer than you
1	on yes pause dur short right so we re recording now i ll put that in the middle of the table there pause dur short and we were going trunc t trunc erm we were going to talk about the door weren t we
1	yes so we ve got the existing opening and the requirement is to have a nice door that fits in with the same style as the door that we ve taken out but with two large glass panels instead of one large plywood panel
1	yeah and you agree that that leaving the er most of the glass plain will allow more light to pass from the erm from the study into the hallway
1	yes that s got to be the main aim what we can do is try and get erm if i look up the standard dimensions of door styles we can work out what the window opening will be and then you can make your glass panel to suit that s probably
1	right
1	the easiest way
1	yes well i think you you mentioned earlier something about the glass being erm the right thickness to go inside the
1	yes we ve got
1	the frame
1	to make sure that the er that the glass is is the right thickness but probably more importantly than that is the fact that it s nice and flat because if the glass is a little bit thicker than the original plywood panel would have been we can er adjust that with the beading that we ve put in on the inside but if it s not flat that s much more difficult to accommodate er you know you can t really build it up with putty or or anything like that so it s it s it s got to be fairly flat
1	i think you re gonna have to give me a measurement of the erm thickness of the glass that you want i know it ll be er probably varied in places
1	yes
1	but we need to know what what the thickness of the glass is going to be
1	yes well trunc w trunc trunc y trunc you know you re you re gonna start off presumably with a flat sheet of glass erm and it ll get a bit distorted in the firing is that is that the likely route
1	well here s er here s a piece of here s a piece of glass that we
1	yes
1	made before and i believe vocal desc cough on this one erm i m pretty sure what happened we had two pieces of float glass one on
1	yes
1	the top and one on the bottom and in the middle we put various colours
1	oh yes that s right yes we did
1	can you see it
1	yes we did yeah
1	erm i
1	so it was a complete sandwich in fact
1	well can you just feel that and tell me whether
1	yeah
1	you think that that is that sandwiched in between do you think
1	er
1	we certainly trunc wa trunc
1	maybe it was just maybe these pieces were just put on top
1	on top
1	but either way they ve they ve melted down to a pretty uniform thickness
1	yeah and those are stringers
1	yes
1	you know where there s just a very thin bit
1	but the the bit that side which was against the mould is actually dead flat pause dur short that s no problem at all that that edge there is dead flat
1	yeah but here you ve got a bit of variegation
1	that s not a problem though but
1	no
1	the the the the trunc f trunc the the edges aren t a problem but the flatness is there so if the if the piece of glass were mounted on something flat in the kiln all the way round it wouldn t be an issue at all
1	no well that s what i m planning to do
1	yes yeah
1	erm and erm
1	and if this if the glass is a little bit smaller than the wooden frame then that s great trunc e trunc erm if it isn t small if it it actually won t quite go in the hole then we can always machine out the wood a little bit
1	mm
1	around to make up that difference
1	well we ve got to take into account the fact that we ll need some extra glass to go round the sides erm to erm sort of fit into the holes provided erm
1	yes the the well it
1	to trunc hol trunc yes
1	yeah it won t be part of the design is it
1	exactly
1	yeah yes
1	so we just trunc l trunc leave a ridge of plain glass all the way
1	yes
1	round the outside
1	yes
1	because actually vocal desc cough the actual pattern of the glass will be virtually and placed in the middle of the two panels
1	yes
1	vocal desc sigh erm that s where the most of the thickness will be
1	yeah yes the the the horizontal piece that goes across the sort of whatever it is two thirds of the way up or or one third of the way up whatever we choose that s obviously going to break the design but you re going to have it as if that s just a sort of shadow across and the design flows through from one side to the other
1	er yes
1	yeah
1	it it erm i m starting at the bottom with a lavender
1	yes
1	erm a sort of vocal desc cough going er over to the right er a bit like looking at a paint brush really
1	yes
1	so it s flowing like a paint brush erm and then the i there s a slim chunk of the erm canadian maple tree will come up the middle of the glass and then there ll be the rebate going across
1	yes yes
1	and then it will continue in the next section
1	yes
1	going up
1	yes
1	and there will be
1	so what i m saying is the rebate sort of just hides that bit of the picture
1	yeah
1	as it were the picture is continuous
1	yes
1	beyond that rebate yes
1	because when i do the when i do the when i do the cartoon for the project i will make sure that erm i do two separate sections of glass which and i i i ll draw the whole thing and then just cut it in half
1	yes yes
1	and so mm mm these two panels could be fired at different times or
1	yes
1	at the same time depending on how depending on how much vocal desc cough er much scope there is in the kiln really
1	the other thing of course is that if we get the trunc n trunc a new door made i haven t got to mess around trying to fill in the door handles and the
1	no
1	holes in the old
1	mm
1	the keyhole in the old door or the hinges i would still have to fill in the hinges and the lock plate on the door frame that s in place but that s that s less work and the other thing we ve got to remember er of course the switch will be on the wrong side of the door so i ll have to move the switch to the other side but i think i can do that by putting a piece of wire across the top of the door as it were and down the other side
1	right
1	and sort of using the existing switch as a junction box
1	right
1	er it s not ideal but i think that s much preferable to having to take up the erm carpet on the landing and and knock a hole through the ceiling which is much more work
1	yes yes i understand that
1	so i think that s i think that s a fairly neat way of doing
1	yeah
1	because you obviously need the switch on the correct side of the door otherwise you can never get to it
1	no
1	with the door open
1	no i see okay and then of course there s the matter of the other erm extra panel for the wall in the hallway
1	oh yes
1	erm
1	yes
1	i thought erm fifty
1	well
1	by a hundred er in size
1	hundred s quite tall isn t it
1	yeah but if you look at that i think
1	yes
1	that s nearly
1	could be
1	a hundred tall
1	erm i think it s a little bit less than that but but it could be taller certainly and there is space there
1	yeah
1	to do it yes
1	and then erm i was thinking along the lines of a red sail and a jetty
1	very nice
1	erm and er you know erm a bit like when we went on derwent water
1	yes
1	where we were watching the boats and the vocal desc cough the grass was and and the trees were growing right down to the lakeside weren t they
1	yes absolutely and and the a bit of green bit of blue er bit of grey and then the bright red sail to sort of
1	yeah
1	mm trunc r trunc really stand out
1	and i was thinking of having the jetty going from the foreground to a vanishing point
1	oh yes that s very er
1	erm
1	er
1	going off to the side
1	yes
1	and then have the sail sort of halfway down and then the background of the green tree
1	sounds good that s a very
1	i thought i d make the jetty almost almost like a sort of lemony vocal desc cough creamy colour a bit like hockney swimming pool type erm idea
1	yes that sounds good that sounds good there s plenty of composition scope there with a vanishing point and whatnot for the jetty yes that sounds good
1	really quite stylised you know
1	yeah
1	erm
1	that sounds good
1	so erm
1	that sounds very good
1	how long have we been speaking for
1	er then we ve got the issue of lighting it up where
1	yes
1	as i say i ve seen these light strips in maplin s which are lengths of flexible almost tape that have got little leds embedded within them and you can use those for sort of putting behind glass or erm it trunc m trunc may even be mount them on the wall and stand the glass off from the wall i don t know there are lots of experiments we could do there to try and
1	you can
1	er see the most effective way
1	i mean you can get some a really lovely you can buy them from the glass manufacturers these really lovely quite outstanding erm chromium erm trunc fi trunc fixings
1	yes yes we ve seen some of them haven t we
1	oh they re absolutely fantastic
1	yes
1	and i m sure they re expensive
1	yes yes
1	and you get those from
1	yes
1	and then if it stands out well i m sure there s a plate a light that s like a plate that you slip behind
1	there are you can get them for actually room lighting a sort of an led panel
1	yeah
1	i suspect they re probably going to be a bit bright for that but i don t know we could look at it erm
1	well we may not need to i mean
1	no
1	we may not trunc nee trunc need it
1	well i think you
1	i mean the other thing you could do possibly is to have a light above it erm
1	yes
1	or a light or a light under it
1	it maybe trunc w trunc you can sort of put a a piece of translucent just plain translucent glass behind the the artwork and light that up as it were
1	mm
1	something like that i dunno it needs a bit of experimentation doesn t it it s er
1	yeah i mean if it s a very bright panel
1	mm er maybe it doesn t need any more
1	erm what we ve got there at the moment is erm rather dark and er
1	yes we could er we could aim one of the spotlights directly at it or directly at the ceiling above it or something or other and maybe maybe that would be enough
1	yeah yeah so erm pause dur short what erm what trunc el trunc what else are we going to get on trunc wi trunc oh yes the fencing panels tomorrow
1	yes well we re doing quite well aren t we we ve done erm trunc e trunc we re just coming up to eleven and there s six to go so er we can we can bash on with that that s about erm er well it s three er three or four days work
1	yeah
1	at our present rate so we should have that done before the weather changes
1	and you ll be back by about quarter to two
1	yes
1	erm erm erm and i should go out er after lunch and erm paint a whole lot of er more more
1	yes
1	more panels
1	and i can
1	to put up
1	do the vacuuming and and we ll be able after an hour or so or an hour and a half we ll be
1	we ll we ll have a enough to put up
1	we ll be able to meet up and carry on with it
1	yeah okay well there is erm there are other things that we should talk about to do with with the house at the moment the other thing that we could possibly discuss is the erm raised beds down in by trunc th trunc
1	yes
1	in in the second garden
1	yes
1	erm they are pause dur short so you ve got you ve got some timber left over haven t you you ve got some timber left over haven t you
1	a rooftop a rooftop vegetable garden as it were except it won t be very high vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes we ve got enough enough timber to erm do something like that quite easily i think
1	i have reservations about cutting down a lot of the rosemary tree because i think
1	yes
1	it s really nice and
1	well that s okay we don t have to do what we ve got to look out for is a is a steel or a erm a metal er tank type thing to form the top
1	right
1	that s what we really need we need a thing about the size of this table but eight or nine inches deep
1	yeah
1	something that that s waterproof really
1	yeah
1	er i mean i suppose it could be plastic but we could encase it in timber all the way round but it needs to be waterproof
1	it does yes
1	erm and sort of
1	those erm those mm unfortunately those rather thick chunky offcuts that you had aren t tall enough are they
1	erm
1	the ones you ve got in the erm in trunc th trunc in the workshop trunc wh trunc you had them unclear soaking unclear
1	no they re probably not no
1	but they re really i mean they d make a really good garden bench
1	yes
1	if we could just find
1	yes
1	a nice piece of wood to go on the top
1	yes
1	like that chap uses down in
1	yeah we could
1	anon type place we could put
1	we could we could find something like that we could find
1	just a plain
1	but we ve got to concentrate on finding the tank or the the the waterproof i suppose it doesn t have to be one big pause dur short you know tank it could be three smaller ones perhaps and that starts to lead you with the idea of plastic boxes but erm the and you d probably have to cut them down a bit but something like that that we could make erm two or three separate pause dur short you know patches together maybe pause dur short i don t know
1	vocal desc laugh i don t think we re thinking along the same lines there but trunc y trunc never mind we ll
1	well we ve got to think of something like that
1	vocal desc laugh er vocal desc laugh i
1	i er or we could just make it out of wood and line it with plastic sheet but it s never so good is it it needs it ought to be a rigid
1	no i
1	rigid
1	i m i well i know what you mean by a tank you mean like a
1	yes
1	it s trunc alm trunc like a swimming pool on
1	yes
1	legs
1	yes that s right
1	and that would be full of full of earth
1	yes
1	and and therefore it won t make the timber trunc r trunc rot
1	absolutely
1	because er it ll be erm be barriered by the plastic
1	yes
1	i can understand that
1	yes
1	so that s quite interesting right so pause dur short i think we ll just go on for a few more minutes talking about this
1	uhu
1	erm is there anything else you want to say oh what about taking the old fencing panels up that s a
1	yeah well i think that s that s okay we can we can start that er and the important thing is to work steadily along and er dig out the soil get out the roots and put the protective barrier in and put the soil back in free of roots i think probably we need to buy a riddle or something to get rid of the the the plant matter as you put the soil back in but anyway the the that s the objective and do it gradually all the way along
1	yeah well we need to go up to the garden centre and find out what sort of soil these plants
1	yes
1	this really dislike
1	yes that s right yes
1	because they re going berserk and they re just growing everywhere
1	of course some of the length we re going to do with gravel aren t we so
1	yes
1	erm
1	yeah
1	we can put down the piece of plastic a piece of polythene sheet and then put those yellow chippings on top and that s easy there s no
1	well
1	no issue there
1	if it s trunc h trunc trunc h trunc how yeah but how how why do you see that gap being you know from the from the new fence into the garden how wide did you see
1	oh just
1	two two foot
1	yeah mm maybe not quite that much but
1	but
1	something like that yes
1	you know what they re like they can come up under that
1	ah but
1	cos they ve already
1	if we put the plastic erm er roof edging pieces down into the ground so
1	mm
1	three or four inches into the ground
1	yeah
1	they shouldn t come under there
1	no
1	but even if they did they then have to negotiate er eighteen inches of barren soil under a plastic sheet under the gravel i don t think they ll get past that
1	no well
1	i should have thought that was fairly erm
1	i trunc ho trunc
1	fairly secure
1	i hope so erm
1	well trunc i trunc if they do they re more likely to be transmitted by seeds i would think under those conditions
1	yeah
1	airborne seeds than than penetrating roots
1	right
1	it s interesting that metal barrier there that i dug up
1	mm
1	they didn t trunc see trunc seem to be any sign of the roots going across the other side there weren t plants spreading across from the other side obviously there trunc w trunc are some the
1	mm
1	other side but i don t think they ve done
1	well maybe
1	that they ve
1	it s a special metal they don t like
1	mm well that s possible i think it s
1	because
1	i think it s simply a barrier and it
1	vocal desc cough
1	stops the roots going through
1	no people who who put the garden in originally were really keen gardeners and didn t she do a course at anon type place college and she was really up on propagation
1	yes i think she was
1	and planting
1	yes
1	and i m sure trunc th trunc they would have thought about the voracity of the
1	yes
1	erm of of the plants
1	well that s possible but i i i still think the fundamental thing is a physical barrier
1	right
1	and it providing it doesn t deteriorate i don t think it really matters what it is
1	trunc m trunc
1	made of
1	no okay well i m we ll leave it there then and i just give
1	okay
1	my reference erm my reference for this recording is bnrbh bnrbh thank you
0	vocal desc laugh oh
0	it s so cute
0	but he tried erm so i were replying in french because he d send like five six snapchats saying what have you just said and i like
0	so my french were probably terrible but his english were just as terrible so we were sort of like talking in french and english to each other like trying to arrange it and erm i was like why aren t we even why aren t we using facebook we ve both got facebook
0	vocal desc laugh mind blown
0	literally literally
0	but yeah er i was like when he was when he were when we were talking about it i was like oh he s so sweet gonna love it he was so surprised oh
0	but erm pause dur short yeah like he he didn t specify flowers and i were just like i m just gonna go and get roses because the one flower that when he bought you the flower in france it were a rose and i thought if he was here he would buy you roses so
0	and i were just like she ll love them and they re from anon nametype m type name so it means more
0	i did love them they were beautiful
0	you have a boyfriend so
0	yeah
0	but roses do have a lot of meaning to me like because they re roses as well it s romantic
0	trunc y trunc yeah
0	i m just being sick inside right now
0	vocal desc laugh
0	it s cool i haven t had a lot of cheese in my life pause dur short first part of cheese was that first rose
0	so
0	making up for lost time vocal desc laugh
0	you can t not cry at that
0	it s beautiful
0	and i were just like i was saying to anon nametype m type name like it s so sad but it s so beautiful it just makes me so upset i was like oh
0	it s like the notebook
0	yeah
0	surrounded by at least three people because i am literally so depressed
0	sit there questioning life
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i love it
0	no i m the same with ps i love you like i know it word for word i read the book a million times i ve seen
0	mm
0	oh i love you oh they were asking about you this weekend
0	they just eat weird stuff
0	they re so thoughtful though
0	well yeah they were so cute
0	sounds good
0	and i m like how do you not know what gravy is it s like one of those greatest creations that man has ever made
0	i d imagine it being quite nice actually
0	mm
0	we should try that one day vocal desc laugh
0	yeah but erm but yeah they were asking about you like erm cos obviously the weekend that you re in doncaster is my nephew s christening
0	for sunday dinner like you could come for saturday dinner but it s not quite the same
0	we don t have enough time do we so
0	yeah
0	yeah

0	on saturday night erm but we got there and they were like one hour waiting time and we were like trunc f trunc fuck that
0	but seeing as we were halfway into town to anon nametype n type name s we had to go dressed up and stuff which is fine i mean we were wearing trainers and stuff like it didn t look too much
0	we ended up being really late but it was cool cos we weren t pre drinking that night obviously

0	yeah me and anon nametype f type name were talking about this earlier actually cos we were saying that we want to go back to wagamama at some point erm but we don t want to spend as much money as we normally do so my answer to that well well we need to sneak our wine in somehow because literally we ll get a sixty pound bill and twenty pound of it ll be wine

0	really
0	well even so getting into bed with some random guy or even random girl is bad

0	is he
0	yeah
0	intensively
0	i didn t think it were that bad i mean er it s only a roof tile it s not like it s the whole roof don t get me wrong but still just even that it s like

0	it s not gonna flood
0	sort of thing it s not gonna flood
0	unlikely
0	and even if we do flood we re not gonna flood on trunc for trunc trunc for trunc fourth floor are we come on let s face it

0	okay
0	that s good though
0	yeah

0	and then she got like other like a varied mark and she was like i m actually quite glad none of these are marked now vocal desc laugh
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	yeah she sounds like it yeah
0	trunc g trunc getting two ones and firsts and stuff and i m really find like really happy for her cos in a non rude way she s never been academic
0	yeah
0	really
0	yeah
0	she loves the subject she s good at it it s like psychology and stuff it s what she s good at
0	yeah

0	from a sober point of view
0	event desc unintelligible and i m completely sober i m just like what the fuck
0	he gets like solid stuff which is
0	not as strong as like actual
0	green weed
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	from erm debenhams john rocher i was like ten pound
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah but they wouldn t last as long
0	well i m only wearing them once
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	yeah it s that topshop one and it were it weren t expensive but i can t find it anywhere
0	and no i haven t because
0	oh
0	yeah
0	just just
0	anon nametype m type name s told her to look for it or not
0	yeah i
0	so it s like straight up straight down
0	yeah
0	and it s completely plain but i found one in topshop that i fell in love with but i couldn t justify paying thirty pounds for it just cos it came from topshop
0	yeah
0	but then the ones in new look and primark and everywhere else that i looked they just weren t nice
0	but i i really couldn t justify it like paying all that
0	twenty seven
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah it s really expensive
0	like it s not all glittery and fancy like it is in there like the one in anon type place is so glittery and fancy you can t find anything
0	the anon type place
0	is that what the new centre s called
0	yeah
0	but there s also
0	right yeah i ve been to i think cos the one in anon type place starts on a trunc sh trunc on a normal road don t it and you get in and then when you come out at the other side it s in the anon type place
0	it trunc st trunc it starts on the high street yeah
0	but i liked it there
0	yeah
0	it s like really trunc co trunc like like extreme hipster like
0	really fashionable
0	like vibrant colours and
0	just stuff that i don t particularly like so find it really hit and miss when i go in there but
0	the sizing for me is wrong
0	you know it like if i buy a size ten in there which i am a size ten like because of the size of my boobs it just does not look right or does not fit right
0	yeah
0	you know
0	but i think that s why i like topshop is they have a petite range
0	and then i go into the petite section and it s the same size that fits like the same but it s just made shorter
0	did you
0	because i originally picked one up from normal
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	which i think is good like for me personally cos my jeans when i go to the normal i can t get jeans in there that fit me pause dur short so i have to go to the tall bit and get jeans from there
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	but that s why i love topshop because you can get a different sized waist plus different size leg
0	because i m like i m small but i m a size eight so please
0	yeah
0	fix that
0	well now i m a size ten which is even longer
0	yeah waists whatever leg whatever
0	a twenty six like a size four
0	yeah literally
0	i think i m like a twenty eight
0	like long leg

0	i think they ll expect us to recognise it
0	i mean i don t know no you still oh if you there s just so much that i m trying to i recognise it when i read it and i understand everything and i m much more comfortable with a lot of things so yeah it s okay but i still can t when i m put on the spot i still don t think i can give a good definition of stuff textbook definition it ll take me minute to think about it and think of a good answer perhaps
0	that s okay
0	yeah that s true
0	still within the field
0	that some people do go out and do that
0	no i mean the cigarette
0	what do you mean this i don t really understand
0	okay
0	if that s what you want then i ll i ll make that what do i mean by peers

0	i believe their language is
0	what is their standardised language do we know
0	is it spanish
0	yeah
0	so i think they speak like french or spanish or both or what erm paes basque unclear goes unclear it s an autonomous community lets see where does it say where they speak the languages official languages basque and spanish
0	basque as a language unclear isolate unclear pause dur short erm
0	is it autonomous or is it
0	who noted the difference between northern pause dur short france and the dialect of pause dur short northern and south france
0	according to this it s a language isolate
0	mm so is that what a language isolate is then
0	mm i guess that when
0	but pre indo european pause dur short i thought
0	yeah
0	once they found a er erm
0	it was to isolate a phony
0	mm yeah
0	nineteen forties thirties i don t know no we ve had recording unclear things unclear since then
0	anyway the fact that before then people were just writing it and everything he said in an interview had to write down they probably had some sort of short form
0	i don t know sounded crazy
0	oh right is that what you were thinking of
0	yeah definitely
0	i wonder if you get paid well for doing that job
0	no
0	it s changing just from a middle school to a high school changing countries changing the type of people that you re teaching their age their level it s there s a whole load of variation on top of the fact that you have different students each time you re not seeing one
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	to like go from being a paediatrician
0	see i think a surgeon can go down
0	you could change i m sure as a doctor you can change but i don t think it s that easy i don t think you could change become an oncologist and then a year later change again and become something else you d be like no you just become an oncologist you need to spend two or three years just training in oncology
0	prosecutor
0	case yeah i feel from my vocal desc laugh from movies i thought pause dur short that you you were either famous for one or the other
0	but i don t but i think that s because
0	and it takes different skills
0	i think lawyers do do both
0	no no only qualified for their particular area
0	and then works in a uni you know what i mean they become trained in whereas in our field okay there are prerequisites for example the company will say you need
0	there s requisite get unclear
0	those bases of experience
0	mm pause dur short that s also the problem with our field is it s inundated with inexperienced people that there are jobs you can do that require very little experience under the teaching english unclear banner unclear
0	there are pause dur short well you re just going to you need to just work your way into institutes where that doesn t happen
0	or work yourself into institutes where that doesn t happen unclear
0	whereas we had to have three years of experience really to be properly considered
0	anon nametype f type name s got her ma
0	who anon nametype f type name
0	but yeah i don t know
0	though we may not have got through
0	and they were from direct references
0	the thing is who referenced anon nametype m type name at that point
0	no one maybe maybe anon nametype f type name
0	they they may trunc hav trunc they were good trunc fr trunc they were friends with anon nametype f type name friends enough that anon nametype f type name that they unclear vouch for anon nametype f type name so i m sure she knew anon nametype f type name she would have known anon nametype m type name
0	i deleted anon nametype m type name
0	oh yeah i need to delete them i actually looked at something today and unclear
0	i kept anon nametype f type name i mean i just you know if anyone asks i cull unclear like
0	no
0	no well you just say you know
0	yeah yeah exactly i was travelling around for a year
0	but erm people use facebook differently don t they
0	yeah depends on the purpose
0	but the problem is when they see you posting on like vocal desc laugh other people s things and they re like oh they click on you then
0	my unclear brother unclear got facebook a couple of weeks ago and he s like he adds people and he looks on their walls be he doesn t there s no other he doesn t do anything he hasn t trunc comp trunc like done anything else on it i don t think he thinks it s really weird cos most people and anon nametype m type name is the same has an account that anon nametype f type name set up for him doesn t doesn t even carry his mobile phone on him most of the time
0	vocal desc laugh
0	my mum s the most the most tech savvy of them all how s that
0	it s a whole nother alphabet
0	the most relevant part which is possible
0	yeah but there s no harm correcting them i correct it i m pretty thorough with my correction
0	so i take that er correction to writing also
0	but like i definitely correct their capitalisation and their commas and all that kind of stuff i teach punctuation a little bit
0	yeah just simple stuff you know about erm conditional sentences if they re reversed not putting a comma in it
0	yeah pause dur short punctuation yeah
0	maybe they are taught it in korean but it doesn t seem to pass it over
0	mm
0	subject questions are a piece of piss
0	yeah but direct object
0	because you just replace the subject pronoun with the the answer or whatever it is
0	but if you have a question like
0	is that unclear right unclear
0	so how do you wear your clothes i wear my clothes pause dur short no the the original the sorry the deep structure would be you how do you wear your clothes you wear your clothes how
0	it just appears because it doesn t have an auxiling
0	vocal desc laugh
0	be simpler

0	i wear my clothes dependent on the context and situation
0	yeah that book s gonna be a bitch vocal desc laugh

0	yeah
0	unclear nice unclear
0	was it worth it or not
0	well
0	erm if you just give it another minute
0	no that s fine

0	two stories
0	oh
0	ah pause dur short that s interesting
0	so there s still no window into the hallway pause dur short but you get a window into the main bathroom and the
0	and the kitchen

0	ugh
0	yes
0	unclear that jacket please
0	well er i mean i guess they ve had to
0	i heard some bad stories pause dur short maybe it was my particular one was a had a particularly bad erm pause dur short cos it trunc w trunc had like a disk pause dur short like in sort of word pause dur short cos there was a sort of rotating part
0	interesting to ask pause dur short it s not something i ve ever particularly looked at
0	possibly pause dur short i think there s just more interesting places to walk
0	actually i ll give anon nametype m type name a ring when we re in town pause dur short cos he might like a lift out if he s going to see his friend first
0	yeah true actually if he s sort of leaving anyway then er
0	no car was he getting erm the bus out do you think
0	yeah
0	yeah we like that pause dur short we wanna support sports direct as far as possible pause dur short it s really funny pause dur short oh my god

0	yeah that s good and some crisps as well
0	oh i ve got a flask which is a canteen so
0	oh okay fair enough
0	cos then we don t yeah we don t have very many bottles at all pause dur short so i don t know if that ll be enough for everyone but
0	that should be fine yeah pause dur short and we re not exactly in the wilderness
0	erm my survival kit i ve got my blanket whistle and compass yeah
0	yep pause dur short erm i mean at work
0	well we ll see when they can do it pause dur short because

0	and that would be quite good hand in your notice before you start
0	um pause dur short anyway yeah so um bloomsbury have erm moved from their old premises
0	well if you wanted to work at bloomsbury like the easiest way for you to do it
0	that ll be interesting yeah pause dur short it would be even yeah it d be good pause dur short er the alternative is bus to anon type place which is perfectly possible
0	well no it s just as bad as er anon type place pause dur short getting into anon type place pause dur short i m not sure where the bus goes to in anon type place pause dur short i m not aware that there s a station particularly pause dur short unclear
0	mm pause dur short i think actually i think they do go close to anon type place pause dur short i remember there being a little rail sign on the erm on the timetable pause dur short there might not be
0	i m sure you could find somewhere to pause dur short yeah pause dur short of course i m not working at bloomsbury s so pause dur short haha pause dur short i don t have any particular
0	well actually that would only get you to kings cross pause dur short at which point you re gonna have to get across london
0	from erm pause dur short so it was a you know it was a bus ride away pause dur short erm you could walk it but it was much easier to get the bus pause dur short you could get the tube but i really wasn t keen on that
0	i haven t no pause dur short i was gonna sort of tell him you know sort of on the boat pause dur short so i ll erm i ll tell him that as well
0	busy isn t it
0	i wonder if there s just some kind of hold up pause dur short it s not normally like this unclear
0	just a bit to anon type place
0	is it oh
0	cos even if they start unclear road pause dur short we should still be closer to them
0	just after lunch pause dur short rainy day they re going into anon type place
0	okay pause dur short right pause dur short we re going to anon type place
0	no you can t
0	just the yeah pause dur short and the back they re coming down past church hill as well pause dur short gosh
0	he was ever a national treasure
0	um which is interesting pause dur short well it depends who you talk to i guess pause dur short or well you know so it was something like that
0	national embarrassment
0	i love that fast into the city centre
0	mm
0	which is pretty interesting pause dur short and i did look into this actually i think looking at some of the things in the
0	well yeah
0	it s promoting the profile of the unclear which is going to get more visitors pause dur short it might not directly be for commercial
0	it should clear up a little bit now but that pedestrian crossing just unclear
0	we ll go to the bank first cos that will close
0	right
0	no pause dur short um
0	that was a nice day
0	yeah
0	so mm yeah pause dur short drop that in the mix
0	right pause dur short normally i d say let in one person pause dur short everyone let s in one pause dur short under these circumstances that s a bit er unclear
0	damn it pause dur short oh jeez i would have got that if i had been a bit quicker
0	yeah basically pause dur short trunc ha trunc handily having a learner there pause dur short haha
0	that is a driving school car pause dur short cos it s got l plates on the side as well
0	i m sorry pause dur short i can t be bothered pause dur short pure efficiency dictates going at a little bit faster than the speed limit
0	oh what a shock
0	so that s a very late bus
0	jesus pause dur short nearly took out another bike then honestly pause dur short dog eat dog
0	what really annoys me pause dur short oh you ve got no idea how much this annoys me pause dur short cos i cycle relatively you know i m in the i m i m sort of faster than maybe two thirds of cyclists
0	but i obey the laws pause dur short so i stop at red lights pause dur short i trunc v trunc and you know et cetera et cetera
0	two minutes time i overtake them again pause dur short i m like just go faster and stop at red lights like pause dur short ar pause dur short vocal desc laugh it really annoys me pause dur short just a waste of my time
0	yeah sure pause dur short full of taxis pause dur short ha
0	they unclear in all fairness
0	mm
0	well i mean if had only been if i had only been twenty that would have been fine
0	is anne s car park free or
0	i said there was a very interesting thing about priority at those um
0	okay so good erm
0	see if we can find a space pause dur short to be fair we could probably get in in kind of one of those garages
0	damn it
0	that s perfect timing believe me as well
0	interesting
0	yeah pause dur short maybe a little bit pushing it pause dur short mm right okay so erm pause dur short i mean a few options we can either just try one of the roads round here
0	what
0	well it means in future we can predict it basically
0	think open
0	yeah open
0	trunc s trunc yeah small erm unclear president anon nametype m type name
0	yeah pause dur short classically pause dur short i was gonna say it will be be full today anyway
0	so we can either erm
0	just keep cruising
0	yeah
0	well alternative is we go out pause dur short we go down pause dur short go out and come into a road on the other side of where er that footpath comes out
0	i think yeah we can just park on one of the roads round here pause dur short the they they can t all be full with parents
0	yeah
0	park in that housing estate
0	yes
0	seems like a good idea yeah pause dur short cos that one that s so far away pause dur short but i m just meaning like a little bit further down there s the roads
0	ah
0	we might just have been able to get in there but that s probably pushing it pause dur short what street oh right
0	probably fairly pause dur short what about anon type place anon type place
0	anon type place pause dur short what that way you mean
0	yeah
0	i mean it might be a little bit trunc furth trunc a little bit closer than driving round to that housing estate pause dur short it s a fair step to get back
0	there s just one space in there
0	is there ah right
0	i fully intend to pause dur short it s gonna take some shuffling to get in there but we can do it with a bit of creativity pause dur short right pause dur short what would be very useful if you could just watch out for pedestrians for me
0	ah sweet pause dur short well done me
0	vocal desc gasp oh no
0	yeah so we had to wait for the next bus to come back and then it wasn t the right bus and it drove straight past and didn t stop and then she made me drive all the way to anon type place to try and chase the bus
0	so we chased the bus it wasn t the right bus and this one actually stopped and we managed to speak to the bus driver
0	oh no vocal desc laugh
0	so i didn t sleep very well anyway and it got to about half past ten and i was like yeah i need to go to sleep now like i m dying cos we need to get up early she went in the bathroom and cried because she was really tired yeah exactly was banging around until like half eleven pause dur short then decided to lie in bed and text her boyfriend pause dur short and i was like anon nametype f type name what the fuck are you doing

0	like even
0	like cos like to threaten to break up with someone if they don t do what you want i m trunc d trunc that s not normal
0	yeah
0	like
0	cos yeah cos cos the thing is like because she didn t have a phone i gave her my old one to borrow
0	and you knew that the only reason she didn t she want she needed a phone like she was really panicking about it is because she wanted to like message him
0	like she doesn t normally she has like like a day or two abroad or something but
0	yeah and i was like
0	and shouldn t emotionally blackmail you
0	no
0	i was like this behaviour is pause dur short and then i put like two asterisks whatever word you want to use to fill this space because there are so many words that could be used to describe that behaviour it s like controlling possessive completely inappropriate slightly psychotic like

0	yeah
0	and it s i m still kind of weighing up but it s difficult cos it s like if i had i dunno if my family were closer or if i was living with anon nametype m type name or if i were living with a really close friend that like you know saw er day in day out and had to deal with it and other people were really impacted by it

0	oh
0	oh ah
0	it s only like an extra twenty minutes the other way so that s fine don t worry about it erm pause dur short yeah so that s about it but i don t trunc h trunc it s not
0	oh
0	okay
0	i know but unclear
1	anon nametype f type name i had a look at your two orchid plants in the erm in i suppose what you d call your pantry isn t it
1	my under stairs in the kitchen
1	yeah yeah erm neither look in the best of health pause dur short erm pause dur short trunc ha trunc did one of them get a bit cold in the winter
1	well they were over at anon nametype m type name s house pause dur short erm so they were in a pause dur short a really a mainly sort of unheated kitchen and they were quite near the window
1	mm
1	but i did pull them back and put them down on the draining board so they weren t fully next to the window and erm i think they did get a bit cold cos as you can see one of the leaves has gone a bit funny in the middle pause dur short erm
1	yeah i ve got a problem like that with one of my leaves and i know exactly how it happened it was in the bathroom and it put its leaf well its leaf went against the window and it was a bit condensated i think it didn t exactly freeze on the window but i think it got very cold in the end of the leaf
1	mm
1	and then i turned it round to try and help it and i think it may have inadvertently stuck its other leaf don t know quite what happened to the other leaf but something happened to it i reckon because it s got a similar mark on it like it s in the trunc m trunc in the middle of the leaf like on yours
1	yes pause dur short well mine my leaves wouldn t have been touching anything cold
1	no but it would been jolly chilly in there wouldn t it
1	yes but i mean it didn t touch against anything
1	no no
1	so it s not the end so
1	no
1	it must be mine must be the cold atmosphere because
1	mm
1	er it s in you couldn t possibly have it touching anything
1	the roots look
1	for that
1	okay on that one though
1	yes
1	so if it probably could do with upping the watering a bit and give it a nice biggish drink and then see by tomorrow how much it actually wants then you may have to
1	mm
1	if er then you trunc cou trunc you know could discard the water out
1	well i have been giving it half a cup er well half of that little container while it s been resting pause dur short erm because it was still in well it was sort of resting i i ended up cutting off the long flower stalk but the flowers were on it for ages and ages
1	mm
1	in fact its flowers were still on when it shouldn t have had flowers pause dur short erm so it may just be confused
1	mm
1	i don t know but i put it in that under cupboard because there s a window in there and it s er although it s south facing it gets shaded by that er a bit shaded by that shrub outside and i don t really have any erm being a terraced house i either have north or south i don t have any pause dur short east or west was it east the chap we saw
1	i don t know but at at erm
1	it was a side wasn t it that i don t have
1	in the bathroom where i keep mine that s
1	mm
1	west actually
1	oh it might be west but that man we erm had a er went to the talk from
1	mm mm mm
1	he was saying pause dur short he thought preferably the type of windowsills i don t have available
1	mm mm
1	well at least you re not in a back to back that d give
1	no that would give you fewer options
1	even fewer options but erm i wouldn t necessarily have bought one of those myself but as they were bought for me
1	mm
1	erm you know can t really say i oh i can t have one of those i don t have the right window for it
1	especially the one that erm er lived in your neighbour s house for a while before he remembered to give it to you
1	oh yes that s may not have helped helped its early progress
1	erm i think there s a problem with the two that erm well it was three and it s now two that er we were given at the botanic gardens last year
1	yes
1	they look awfully sickly and they ve got some really dodgy brown marks on the leaves which i don t think are intended
1	no
1	vocal desc cough excuse me
1	yes well well those er my two one of them seems to have a little leaf starting to grow
1	that s a good sign
1	in the middle but it looks a bit well it doesn t look like it s dried but it is a much darker colour but that that s maybe how they are but the other one is er only got a dried bit in the middle really it hasn t sort of brought up a new shoot
1	mm
1	so er it s got some new roots cos i thought the knobbly things might turn into something else but they they re roots
1	mm
1	so i m not quite sure pause dur short about those we ll have to er see how they get on really
1	yeah
1	mm i have got some little cuttings in the bathroom of a well there s an aluminium plant pause dur short erm in some water er
1	they seem far less common than they used to be
1	no you can t get that so i was trying to keep that one on because it is pause dur short i i ought to cut the tops off and do them again because they re getting very tall and thin but i m worried about losing them completely cos i haven t really seen any about
1	no
1	er so and they do seem to like being in water so that s why i ve left them like that erm and next to it in another little pot there s some philodendron i believe it is sweetheart pause dur short vine plant which erm has heart shaped leaves for its name and that likes being in water so i ve left those cuttings in water for quite a time and i noticed the other day pause dur short that it s very cheeky one of them erm has put out a a shoot which they do and they trunc ca trunc you can root from those shoots and it s stretched across and stuck its new roots in the other one s water
1	ah
1	so they re like in a chain which reminded me of your orchid
1	yeah
1	that was in the next pot to another orchid in your bathroom and it and it put its roots in its neighbour s pot
1	and that might be the same one that er put its root on your flannel
1	oh yes and that s right cos i d forgotten that yes cos when i was there and the flannel was hanging on the hook a little further down it it seemed to be progressing its root and its root was resting on my flannel
1	yes
1	so er
1	very unclear
1	it s a different way of getting your flannel dry having an orchid drink the water off it but er
1	you know the spiky plants at your house that no sorry not at your house at anon nametype m type name s house
1	yes
1	that came from anon type address probably originally
1	yes yes
1	there s about half a dozen of them just sitting in water
1	oh well trunc s trunc trunc s trunc er some are in water and some are in little tiny pots
1	oh well i think most of them are in water
1	but they may have got too cold as well
1	oh
1	although they normally live in my north face they seem to like it in my north facing sticky out window
1	i think they look quite poorly sitting in water i m thinking about taking them into productive protective custody
1	you think i should have them taken from me
1	well i don t know until you can you know and and i can
1	until i m
1	until your certified as er somebody who is
1	vocal desc laugh when i m a trunc ca trunc a capable plant mother
1	well i don t know
1	yeah yes
1	i think they don t look very well at the moment
1	no but i think they belong to the one upstairs possibly
1	mm i m having some problems with those myself actually although i have got a lovely tub
1	mm
1	and oh the thing i didn t tell you is that i just stuck some in this pot from i had one oh i dunno last trunc ye trunc couldn t have been last year cos last year so little got done the year before last planted it up and it was quite poorly but it it it came on nicely and this year it s put up three of those you know those flowers that shoot on long stems
1	oh right really nice substantial ones
1	mm mm
1	oh good
1	erm and it hasn t done anything silly like that pheasant s breast plant
1	no
1	which erm keeps putting flowers out stalks out and they seem to go at funny angles
1	yes
1	these are i don t know i m they may have happened by now but they were growing up quite slowly
1	yes
1	erm
1	well that one in the bathroom usually has flowers
1	yes
1	but it hasn t had any
1	well i ve had it years and years and it s never done anything but erm it looks as though you know it it it s
1	mm
1	it s coming on but then i took two babies off when i repotted it and they they look quite sickly
1	oh
1	but so i replanted them up again er and so i was just wondering whether i ought to take the other ones or at least i think you should give them some soil i think they ve got they caught chlorosis
1	what s that
1	it s when they lose their their chlorofilm trunc chlor trunc
1	oh yes they they do look a bit insipid on the other hand they can go red cos they get too cold
1	chlorophyll not chloroform yes
1	chlorofilm trunc chloro trunc vocal desc laugh
1	trunc chlor trunc
1	vocal desc laugh chloroform
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh they might not be allowed as erm houseplants if they had chloroform in them
1	no no don t sort of put them and unclear
1	you don t go sniffing them
1	no
1	no pause dur short yes yes chlorophyll yes i was wondering if i should know vocal desc laugh what substances they had in them yes
1	mm
1	but the erm what do you call them i think mum used to call them a she called them a money plant the ones with the sort of trunc su trunc the succulents with the round fleshy leaves
1	yes
1	erm there s a bit of an old it may have been the original sort of one i had cos it s a very old woody root that was on its side and it had started to grow some little bits now that s in anon nametype m type name s bathroom
1	mm
1	and that s look gone lovely
1	mm
1	that s that s enjoying itself in there it s it looks much better and i should make some little plants out of those
1	mm got you ve got a few other things on at the moment
1	i know that s why things have got haven t got erm
1	mm
1	done
1	now thinking about important things well this is probably only of theoretical important thing because we know what you re doing about your birthday cake but if you were going to choose what birthday cake you wanted and this isn t the birthday cake you re going to get

1	which is sort of thinking well that s mince isn t it so it s mince or curry plain mince or curry whatever
1	i don t remember er now you haven t told me what birthday cake you would like
1	oh sorry i was
1	so
1	avoiding the issue
1	you can make you can make the decision just now and you re not committed to staying with it but if you at this very moment a cup of a pot of earl grey tea was going to come in
1	yes
1	and a birthday cake was going to come in what flavour would you like that cake to be
1	well there s so
1	trunc wha trunc what kind
1	there s so many oh so many nice ones but now you remind me of that gooseberry one that was particularly fine
1	so it would be the gooseberry the sponge cake the or the
1	so the
1	the lighter the victoria sponge with cream in it and gooseberry cooked with some elderflower
1	yes well it s like a
1	well it s trunc elder trunc

1	vocal desc laugh
1	gooseberry and elderflower
1	flower
1	cake probably it s called
1	yes vocal desc laugh gooseberryflower might be nice
1	okay so today that s the cake you would have
1	yes well it it s cos it s got sort of erm it s got bits of gooseberry in
1	no it hasn t
1	hasn t it got bits of slightly it well it s it or it s puree it s sort of it s erm
1	what you mean
1	well it s in that cake
1	in the cake no trunc n trunc it s just sponge cake
1	i no in the the filling
1	oh in the filling
1	the filling isn t
1	trunc ye trunc the filling is real gooseberries yes
1	it s real gooseberries but
1	but unclear have bits of them in
1	no it s trunc rea trunc
1	well it doesn t have the end bits obviously
1	real gooseberries but it wasn t all pippy and pippy and watery it was a bit sort of
1	mm
1	i think they might have pureed a little bit to give it
1	well
1	some thickness
1	when i did it i jammed it with elderflower
1	oh you jammed it yes well i mean it s got to have
1	mm well i don t trunc kn trunc i mean
1	something done to it yeah
1	i put it in a pan and erm
1	yes
1	put elderflower syrup in
1	yes
1	and made a sort of jam out of it
1	oh that sounds very nice yes
1	well i thought there s no point putting some
1	yes
1	elderflower and some sugar cos you get less elderflower then
1	yes
1	i m not trunc s trunc pause dur short i may also when i it i may i i had some caster sugar i think
1	yes
1	and i stuck elderflower
1	mm
1	flowers in
1	yes
1	elderflowers i suppose you can call them can t you erm
1	yes
1	and erm pause dur short i trunc u trunc may have used that in the cake
1	mm but you ve got to have make your filling sort of stay within the bounds of your cake unclear
1	well i make it quite thick yeah
1	yes it s got to be quite a thick
1	cos erm i mean
1	consistency
1	you know anon nametype m type name is able to make jam that you can t get out of the jam jar so unclear
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	oh i probably put a little bit of lemon juice actually in it too
1	vocal desc laugh gravity resistant jam yes
1	mm mm
1	did you find a commercial industrial use for it
1	no no no he managed to get it out
1	yes
1	you could if you were concerted you could get it out and he he recooked it with more fruit
1	oh right
1	and made a very nice he made the best it was the best jam he ever had
1	and was he alright afterwards it didn t cos you wouldn t want it to sort of solidify vocal desc laugh in you tummy would you
1	oh no it was just the erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it was the angle the knife the amount of leverage you could actually get in the top of the jam jar
1	oh right i see yes
1	erm but
1	that s why bonne maman jam jars are good cos
1	yes absolutely
1	they don t have any resistance
1	erm
1	at all
1	you were talking about school dinners
1	oh yes
1	and the only school dinner i remember as in school dinner pudding is
1	mm
1	really actually this isn t true but at the time it was true when i trunc s trunc i i thought of it the other day was gypsy tarts
1	gypsy tarts yes
1	now how would you make the gypsy
1	well
1	do you think it was politically correct to say gypsy tart now
1	it s probably it s probably erm
1	travellers tart
1	travellers tart now i don t know vocal desc laugh er gypsy tarts well it s er condensed milk i believe it s condensed milk and possibly brown sugar to give the
1	unclear
1	colour maybe
1	so it s like a
1	because it s instant straight through your enamel and make your teeth drop out sort of stuff
1	mm
1	and then it s kind of whisked trunc w trunc whisked up a bit trunc s trunc and so it s sets i mean er whether they put egg or something in it to make it set
1	i unclear mm
1	but it is like a it s it is like a sort of mousse isn t it event desc sound of phone
1	oh i don t know who that can be it is like a mousse
1	mm
1	kind of a set mousse isn t it it s not event desc sound of phone
1	as i recall it s a bit more it s not just like a blancmange pause dur short it s not like a custard
1	mm
1	it s more of a erm pause dur short well mousse is the nearest thing i can think of not too unclear holey unclear
1	it doesn t it doesn t trunc c trunc it doesn t flow out of the pastry case
1	no no it sits
1	mm
1	but you know but it s not like making a chocolate blancmange and
1	mm
1	setting it in a pastry
1	i was trying to describe it this was at that party on
1	yes
1	anon nametype m type name s family party
1	mm
1	and i was talking to his pause dur short sister in law
1	yes
1	anon nametype f type name
1	yes
1	and erm she said how she liked school dinners and i said i wasn t sure i really liked school dinners very much i i quite liked gypsy tart
1	yes
1	and i said but i think they only have it in anon type place
1	well i m wondering that
1	i think it s i think it s a anon type place food i think i ve seen it written somewhere anyway it s unclear
1	because erm anon nametype m type name knew about gypsy tart he was sort of anon type place almost well he was at school in anon type place
1	mm
1	even though he lived in anon type place i mean he was born in anon type place but they lived in anon type place when
1	mm
1	by the time he was at in school age
1	mm
1	so he trunc re trunc er well admittedly he s only just in anon type place but he
1	mm mm
1	remembered gypsy tart well but other people nobody round in yorkshire
1	mm
1	seemed to know they d have curd tart in yorkshire but they didn t know about gypsy tart
1	no
1	so i think it might be a
1	mm
1	a southern thing
1	mm cos i described it it was somebody as like banoffee pie without banana in
1	and that s probably why
1	so
1	i liked it anon nametype m type name
1	i wasn t i wasn t very far off then was i
1	yes
1	because that s condensed milk and erm sugar i m fairly sure
1	yes cos i think it s got should be condensed milk for the er thickness of it
1	mm
1	as well rather trunc tha trunc and trunc eva trunc evaporated
1	mm
1	cos don t you make fudge or something with pause dur short condensed or can you make fudge with condensed
1	with unclear
1	i ve never made it
1	cut out a recipe out of the waitrose magazine for tablet which is
1	oh yes that s scottish isn t it
1	scottish tablet
1	extremely sweet
1	which is a simple kind of fudge apparently
1	yes but it s well it s extremely sweet event desc sound of phone
1	i m sorry about this
1	oh
1	i don t know is it s all these er it s all these they ve got my email mixed er my er they ve got my phone mixed up with the queen and her ninetieth i think
1	i don t want to go on about school dinners but erm what was your favourite then
1	i can t recall having a favourite i mean you just had them
1	mm
1	my view rather some bits were better than others they did pretty good roast potatoes anon nametype f type name was always the one for roast potatoes cos she was little and
1	mm
1	she was trunc li trunc little and blonde
1	mm
1	and er you know sort of quite cute she was trunc al trunc my friend she was always the one who got er picked early on in the when we were in the first year to give present bouquets and things to visiting dignitaries and er she always managed to get seconds at least on roast potatoes
1	mm
1	don t know whether the dinner ladies thought it might make her grow a bit more but er
1	mm
1	but she was quite small and thin but er she could eat like a horse
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	we didn t have strapping boys to give the meat the the potatoes to
1	no no this is true not at that time no it was just us and er pause dur short yes but and then when when it was sixth form did you have tables erm separate tables
1	we were allowed tables
1	vocal desc laugh
1	chairs and tables knives and forks and water cups
1	vocal desc laugh
1	from the first year actually
1	vocal desc laugh so were we but when you were in the sixth form up to the sixth form you you queued up in your years and got your plate and went and sat down at a table
1	mm
1	once you ve got your dinner
1	mm
1	past the servery hatch
1	mm
1	but when you were in the sixth form they had erm tables of about six eight six or eight those trunc l trunc longer sort of tables and erm pause dur short i think we had we sat at those somehow i have a feeling that you we had heated containers that you had your dinner out of or else they they put these on the table for the eight to kind of help themselves i suppose it was encouraging table manners
1	oh
1	i don t know cos anon nametype f type name was always er keen to finish off the the tray
1	mm mm
1	the allocated tray of potatoes if
1	mm
1	everybody didn t want them and
1	no we didn t have anything
1	yes
1	we we always just had an ordinary table
1	yes i m sure we had some i can t remember
1	mm
1	the exact arrangement now because those tables were at trunc s trunc er not you know where you went through to the stage there used to trunc b trunc you used to be able to walk behind the
1	mm
1	the stage
1	mm the the trunc p trunc to the pe area
1	yes erm the pudding used to be there served up just in that entrance there
1	oh
1	there used to be ladies with the big vats of custard
1	mm yes
1	and the
1	yes yes yes
1	slices with the tray tarts and things
1	in the hall but would be the other side of the door
1	on the on the
1	yeah yeah
1	side of the
1	yeah
1	in the wings of the stage really
1	oh no
1	area
1	this this was just done in the hall erm outside the you know in the further up in the same entrance hall
1	cos the servery was in the servery bit
1	mm
1	and er but and there s that narrow bit of hall beyond those going through to the passageway at the side of the going through to the other block there was a narrow bit and then there was the main
1	mm mm
1	dining hall
1	mm
1	well the sixth form tables used to be in that narrow bit
1	oh
1	yes
1	oh i think people who had sandwich lunches ate them there
1	yes i don t know whether had one had sandwich lunches i think they got put in some classroom
1	mm mm
1	or somewhere i don t think sandwich packed lunches were
1	mm
1	encouraged
1	mm
1	really yes but we used to have water on the table and
1	mm
1	that sort of thing as well
1	mm
1	and at christmas if you got a sixpence in your pudding
1	mm
1	which health and safety probably wouldn t allow these days
1	no i m sure not
1	er if you got a sixpence you were supposed to hold it up and stand on your chair
1	mm
1	and everybody would clap
1	mm
1	did you do anything like that
1	no
1	well you were ten years behind me so
1	yeah
1	so er perhaps it was considered the done thing
1	no probably not
1	no did you used to have to queue up did you queue up at the side in a medical room opposite
1	yeah yeah
1	those girls toilets there
1	yeah yes
1	come in that way
1	mm
1	and down the side
1	mm
1	and round to the surgery
1	yeah i think so
1	oh right
1	oh
1	i m not quite sure where the staff used to sit or if they used to take theirs up to the staff some of the staff used to have dinners
1	i don t know unclear the staff had dinners
1	and before you got into that bit by the medical room you used to queue up outside in the
1	mm
1	exterior
1	mm
1	hold vocal desc laugh to come in those doors
1	i don t remember queuing in cos i was in the boys school for the first three years were in the boys school
1	oh i didn t realise you were
1	yes
1	in the or that one
1	well that the boys the junior school was in the boys school
1	oh right
1	and then the o level classes and sixth form some of the sixth form anyway were in the erm the girls school
1	oh cos you were unclear
1	but i don t
1	weren t you
1	i i trunc hardl trunc i i do remember yes it was the same i can remember queuing up for the the meals but then i remember you you did as a prefect right you know a sixth former you could do dinner duty
1	oh so you you were in mixed
1	yes all the time
1	you were in mixed and did you have your dinners in the boys school hall
1	well only when i was er in the junior school
1	in the junior school oh right
1	mm
1	i see i didn t realise you d had your dinners there but always had mine in the
1	well you d have them in your own school wouldn t you
1	in my school vocal desc laugh
1	mm mm mm
1	with the blue trunc p trunc with the mosaic pillar in the middle
1	mm did i tell you i went back to anon type place the last time i went down to anon type place
1	oh right
1	and erm i they had a they had the farmers market they used to have them in one of the there s an academy somewhere around there
1	yes
1	erm but they don t
1	oh it s er yes i know i can t think which school it used to be
1	er it s on the anon type place road
1	erm pause dur short oh there was a anon type place was it
1	no
1	no it s one of the other ones
1	anon type place is near just next door
1	yes next door it s the other way i can t think of i
1	anyway
1	unclear
1	it s something something academy
1	yes yes it used to be somebody else s
1	and so i d been to the farmers market there so i went to the farmers market at anon type place cos i thought well it s an excuse to have a look and see what
1	yes
1	they ve done but it s erm pause dur short it it s a completely cos they ve knocked down the boys school
1	oh
1	and they ve built it where the boys school was cos you remember we went back to anon type place just before they started building
1	yes
1	cos they ve kept some of the girls school and the boys school s gone
1	yes
1	but they ve put a sort of a sixth form i think it s the sixth form studies building
1	yes oh
1	there
1	right so they are they are they still anon type place or are they an academy
1	no they re anon type place
1	oh
1	well i think they re haven t they all got to become academies now or did that get thrown out
1	no i think it got i think it i think er there was a u turn on that
1	mm well they re er they are they re anon type place grammar school but they re in a a school group with anon type place
1	oh yes i know they are but they haven t unclear added academy unclear
1	i don t think so but they re a language they re a language
1	yeah
1	specialist school or something
1	yes yeah oh right
1	but going back going back and like
1	mm
1	you know this isn t my school
1	no
1	er i have no
1	well not vocal desc laugh
1	connections no interest
1	not vocal desc laugh
1	in going back
1	not not vocal desc laugh if it s been flattened but we went er a few years back we went and we we met that very nice man who showed us round
1	mm mm
1	didn t we
1	yes that was just before they took
1	yes
1	the building down
1	because erm it was interesting walking round the girls school because erm although they ve changed some of it there were odd bits of the girls school sort of poking out here and there like
1	mm
1	the odd bit of staircase you remember
1	yeah yeah i remember that
1	with the original erm rails or or the odd erm well some of some of the views had changed cos they d built things here and and also erm when i was at school you weren t allowed to go across the joining erm sort of erm er what would you call it not exactly a bridge cos it was over a corridor but the bit the walkway that was on top of the corridor joining erm the bit erm from the dining hall where the passage went across to the rest of the classrooms with our music in erm you you weren t allowed to go across that because one end was the staff room and the other end was trunc che trunc near the chemistry lab or something
1	yes
1	but we we actually we actually walked quite near there or over there
1	oh yes
1	somehow
1	yes cos
1	erm
1	yes it was
1	you know the
1	biology that was where biology was
1	yes
1	er chemistry on one side biology on the other and it was like the tech room in the middle
1	yes
1	that was the tech room and then i don t know that i don t the staffroom wouldn t have been the other end in my day
1	no the staff you know the open well the initially open plan nineteen fifties sixties whatever it was erm you know fifties probably early sixties open plan stairs they had in the
1	mm mm
1	entrance hall
1	mm
1	which was a dining hall
1	mm
1	erm or it when you went up there there was the open plan ones which i didn t like and then they went to normal stairs and as you went round the first classroom of that landing was french and the room behind it was the staffroom
1	mm well the staffroom moved into the old library when i was there
1	oh the library upstairs
1	mm
1	was that the trunc libr trunc like the library used to be a classroom cos we had i had the library as a classroom and then there was a little room you came from that staircase you went into the library and if you went out the library the other end there was a little room that if you walked through it it was a classroom but
1	mm
1	if you walked through it you ended up on the top of the other staircase
1	mm
1	where needlework and geography i oh it s
1	yeah
1	on that floor geography
1	probably
1	was on the floor and then if you went down a floor it was needlework
1	mm
1	erm because you couldn t use it trunc wha trunc you weren t supposed to use that as a through route because it was a classroom
1	mm
1	erm it i think it was an english classroom
1	fairly sure you can go through it in my day
1	erm or am i or was that right or was it that little joining place you weren t supposed to through was it off the commerce room was like that cos the commerce room was below the library i m just trying to think trunc h trunc what happened to the commerce room
1	in my day you went to the boys school
1	no
1	cos i m i first saw erm rows of people sitting behind typewriters
1	ah
1	cos i think i my first year erm my form room was the on the floor above in the junior school in the first year i think that was the year where the school leaving age increased from
1	oh yes
1	fifteen to sixteen
1	no i think i can remember that unclear and i think perhaps you could go in the library both ends but you couldn t go in the commerce room maybe that was it
1	it would be quite handy for the staffroom to be able to get into both ends wouldn t it it would save somebody having to all the way down and all the way up
1	yes yes well that s it they could cut across that link from the
1	mm
1	the art and music pause dur short down near the bicycle sheds end of things of the girls school
1	mm mm
1	to the main hall end because otherwise erm otherwise you ve got to go erm you ve got to go down and round through the hall and along that passage to get
1	mm
1	so it s quite a long way whereas you can just nip out the back door of the staffroom cos the teachers used to sunbathe up there on that trunc pat trunc thing
1	mm
1	unclear cos nobody else was you know the lunchtime had their sandwiches or you know whatever they were doing erm up there yes pause dur short well that s interesting
1	mm
1	but it has all changed rather a lot round there with that anon type place retail park not far away and things
1	yeah i mean obviously they ve got a lot of shops down there now haven t they
1	mm
1	in that area because you know the bit i dunno anon type place it s
1	anon type place retail park or something
1	is that is that anon type place
1	anon type place is east yes anon type place is anon type place retail park
1	oh is it
1	something i think
1	mm
1	yeah so i think i ve seen that as a name or it it s that kind of trunc a trunc area
1	well there s anon type place and then if you go on a bit you get to tesco which isn t quite joined then there s asda isn t there
1	yes well i think the whole thing
1	we ve got a heck of a lot of shops
1	yes
1	you can see why the er high street in anon type place s died
1	is struggling yes
1	because
1	mm
1	unless there s a lot more people down and they need a lot more things cos afterwards when i left anon type place when i went to the farmers market i thought i might pick up a little something for lunch
1	yes
1	and there wasn t really anything that looked really tasty
1	yeah
1	so i thought i d pop into marks and spencer s cos remember there s that big marks and spencer s food
1	near the travelodge
1	yeah yeah on that trunc b trunc and i thought well i ll pick up erm what i d had previously was these little box salads er
1	oh yes
1	not not trunc l trunc leaves erm but erm couscous and roast vegetables and
1	yes
1	you know those prepared salads
1	prepared yes yes
1	i suppose you d call them so i thought oh i ll get another one of those well in fact i got two and had half of two
1	yes
1	and erm and i thought gosh you know there s every shop unlike anon type place it seems where you have to go to different bits if you were going to go in town for shopping or
1	yes
1	you know you have to go right up anon type place road to get a range of shops all the shops they re they re all kind of around there they re all within not exactly walking distance because you re not meant to walk around there really
1	no
1	but there s a lot more choice of shops than when we were there
1	well they were different as well we when we there were when i when i was when i was there to start with the supermarkets had only started to arrive when i was little
1	yes yes but i m not i m but if you wanted to buy anything you sort of had to go to anon type place didn t you
1	well the very big shops were at anon type place i mean our marks and spencer s is a reasonable size
1	but you either went into
1	or or people went to oxford street you used to trunc g trunc go on a shopping trip to london people did
1	yes but all the sort of the shops you d go to anon type place for say when i was there in eighty pause dur short i suppose perhaps anon type place high street had started dying in the eighties but in the eighties like anon type place had all the
1	mm
1	the names you know
1	yeah
1	i m talking about anon type place and posh department stores but you know the sort of shops
1	yeah
1	that you d get in every high street you had to go to anon type place to find one but
1	well
1	they re all at anon type place
1	yes well i know there used to be erm a dolcis in anon type place and well there used to be a dolcis on anon type place high street was it a dolcis or was it a saxo
1	no
1	they had one almost both of them opposite each other didn t they
1	no well freeman hardy willis and dolcis
1	there was freeman hardy willis but i know anon type place had one
1	anon type place was it
1	erm i don t no i think it was dolcis er it s in anon type place maybe
1	oh
1	they didn t have a branch at anon type place at the time cos it s i didn t really remember it opposite anyway we if you wanted to see all those sorts of shoe shops you you had to really go to anon type place if you wanted to see the full
1	mm
1	range although we got quite a few of them you know if you didn t want to go to erm the clarks or the er ones in anon type place so er and er pause dur short well we had anon type place s got in your have you was anon type place s still there
1	mm
1	cos anon type place s
1	used to have those little machines that shot money round the roof didn t it
1	mm yes er anon type place s was alright i mean that had materials and things but there were more fabric shops in anon type place because it was a a bigger place but you could you could get what you wanted trunc r trunc more or less
1	mm
1	erm thinking about it and there were quite a few electrical shops and things but the trouble is if you haven t got a car pause dur short you can go on the bus to anon type place but erm pause dur short as you say if you re a pedestrian it s a lot of walking
1	mm
1	you know if you re an older person it s a
1	yes
1	you might trunc fi trunc they might have what you want but you ve if you haven t got a car to go in or you haven t got a car to drive round all the different bits of it
1	mm
1	erm it s a lot of walking
1	mm
1	and the road scheme doesn t seem to be terribly sensible
1	but i was just amazed how much they had there
1	mm
1	erm and i thought gosh i suppose
1	all this
1	it serves all the
1	mm
1	all the towns around
1	yes well there s erm the sort of not diy exactly what am i thinking of erm
1	well there s a whole lot load of those as well
1	diy and and erm pause dur short furniture shop type places and things pause dur short quite a few of those there are some trunc d trunc diys but it s not all clothes and food there s other carpets and
1	mm
1	stuff aren t there quite a few different pause dur short but er well i suppose because and also with anon type place pause dur short your shops in anon type place have had to fit in with anon type place pause dur short because they couldn t just knock a great hole in the middle of
1	oh no
1	anon type place and stick a shopping centre in
1	well they did with the anon type place centre
1	they did with the anon type place
1	unclear
1	but i mean in
1	yeah
1	in the er in the main bit
1	mm
1	erm you know they had more more restriction on that and it s it s a wealthier place than anon type place cos you get more tourists sort of thing
1	mm
1	to come and look at everything i suppose the same with anon type place that would be the the main pause dur short historic centre
1	mm but they ve got a whole new shopping centre on the side of anon type place
1	yes
1	or it seemed to be
1	mm
1	as i m not a big shopper it doesn t make too much difference to me really
1	mm
1	cos i rarely go into anon type place to buy anything
1	no
1	but i was just trunc am trunc i was just amazed cos i i popped in and i thought i d buy a sandwich and i thought gosh there are all these shops here
1	yeah
1	cos i i went and used erm pause dur short a wilko
1	wilkinson s
1	yes yes
1	yeah
1	and there was something else there and i thought well i m not gonna spend i could usually pick something up there because these things need a bit of planning
1	yes
1	erm
1	mm
1	normally because don t have the the the shops around
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short and i suppose it s living out a bit anyway cos it s a bit of a drive to get not a drive to get into anon type place but
1	mm
1	you know it s an effort to go into anon type place in a way
1	mm pause dur short and also in anon type place erm a lot of the land is controlled by the universities
1	oh absolutely
1	so
1	yes
1	there s er unless the university wants to sell off that land which they or use it themselves there s not vocal desc laugh they re a bit like a a version of tescos that used to wasn t it tescos used to go around buying up things well
1	mm
1	er anon type place don t exactly go around buying up things but they ve got so much trunc h trunc land from historic times and
1	mm
1	things they ve been left and stuff that there s a lot of anon type place you might not appreciate does actually belong to to various university groups
1	oh absolutely i mean most of the centre belongs to unclear wherever unclear and it wasn t that long ago that they bought that erm the bit that s now anon type place docks
1	yeah
1	they they bought
1	oh yes i mean but i mean within anon type place but they
1	yes
1	they they ve bought land in all sorts of odd places
1	mm
1	yes
1	but they ve you know it was
1	yeah
1	it s it s one of the docks unclear
1	is it trunc f trunc er anon type place
1	anon type place
1	anon type place
1	anon type place
1	anon type place
1	yes
1	trunc y trunc trunc y trunc yes
1	erm i think anon type place er one of the colleges bought it
1	yeah
1	erm because somebody the story goes that the bursar found out about it when everyone else was on holiday
1	and he thought it was a bargain
1	and he had he trunc ha trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	no he had to make a decision before he could get in touch with the master or whoever
1	yes
1	you know or
1	yes
1	the other senior people so he took a punt on it
1	yes mm
1	and it worked out very well and i don t there s two things he bought that and he bought something else at the same time
1	yes
1	and er he s made the college
1	and they bequeathed with things
1	i can t think which college it is now is it anon type place one of the colleges
1	don t know
1	whichever unclear yes yes cos erm anon nametype m type name s anon nametype m type name s daughter who s doing some fundraising and erm they were trying to raise something for their must be their four hundredth anniversary
1	oh yes mm
1	and they set two years or something
1	yes
1	to get all these millions and they set off to do these well
1	yes
1	i don t think they personally were but they they were doing it s a worldwide sort of
1	yes
1	appeal
1	yes
1	and they got at least as much money in a very short time
1	yeah
1	so yes but people are you know successful and want to give money
1	mm
1	and then you get weird trunc peop trunc not weird people but trunc k trunc trunc un trunc there was the man er man who gave the anon type place as in the anon type place centre at anon type place college
1	yes
1	you know as you drive out along the erm the road to anon type place
1	yes
1	there s a funny shaped building
1	mm
1	anon type place college
1	yeah
1	and that was left by somebody who was erm apparently had no connections with the college but just thought it would be a good place to have his name remembered i suppose
1	yes
1	or wanted to do a good deed or
1	yes
1	erm whatever
1	that s right mm
1	yeah
1	mm that s good
1	oh i was going to tell you something and i just can t think what it is now we were talking about er pause dur short land oh oh it s gone no it s gone completely it will come back pause dur short so pause dur short what are you hoping to get pause dur short is there anything you you would really like to do this afternoon or you feel we ought to do this afternoon cos it s nearly it s nearly the eve of your birthday
1	it is
1	and i know that you might there might be things in relation to anon nametype m type name s house that we need to sort out pause dur short or you might want to go out now or
1	well
1	or you might want to do anything
1	it looks a bit well it s not actually raining now but it doesn t look very bright out there
1	i ll take that as a kind of no then
1	although the trees are looking extremely verdant but er pause dur short i can t i mean it s it well i know it s i m looking out of the north window but looking down there further it doesn t look that sunny on those house roofs that
1	mm
1	might have got some sunshine
1	mm
1	and there s a bit of a breeze blowing so perhaps we we could go for a little pause dur short walk and go and nose at anon type place park see what they re doing
1	yes oh i m not suggesting we trek as it were i just
1	no
1	you know as in er here or
1	well we could
1	trunc s trunc
1	well we ll we ll take a drive up to anon type place park and just go and nose about and see what they re doing to set up for the triathlon
1	oh yes okay
1	oh in fact we could drive up there to find out how long it is and see if it s as far as you can walk
1	good plan mm
1	erm
1	you could make me walk and see where i stop
1	you can run along behind the car and i ll tell you how far you ve been
1	because it make me go set off and then i ll tell you i ve got there or you come and pick me up but
1	yeah
1	that might not be
1	no so we we could have a a a test of how far it is because we won t be able to to go anywhere tomorrow because
1	mm
1	i can t go anywhere because the road is closed
1	i can actually trunc l trunc always look it up on google maps but we could that
1	oh yes i hadn t thought about that
1	that is a possibility
1	yes pause dur short right
1	do you want to go down to anon type place and look at that shop entrance
1	oh not especially
1	i can t remember exactly why i want to do it now but
1	oh
1	have we looked at it enough on google maps
1	you you ve looked at it i just wanted to establish where it was because
1	yeah
1	it s difficult with erm addresses that have got a hundred and something in them or five hundred and something as to which bit of a very long road it is erm and i thought it was on that bit yes
1	now i haven t put those er
1	and you can t go and get your keys
1	sorry
1	cut in anon type place s yet so
1	cos i haven t got them
1	you haven t got them so
1	where is that
1	anon type place s is along it s up anon type place road almost to the school
1	oh right okay erm the thing i haven t done also is i haven t put the reflector spotlights on freecycle yet
1	no
1	because possibly
1	somebody needs to be there
1	no no no
1	if anybody s interesting
1	no no no they ll phone they ll get in touch in whatever way
1	oh right
1	we ask them to
1	yes
1	cos you need to know when otherwise you re gonna you know don t just wait and see if anyone comes you arrange it with a particular individual
1	yeah
1	but possibly i should have should measure the erm the width of the front of the lamp you know the top of the non screwy end of the lights
1	the glass bit
1	yes the width of it because looking at how they re sold
1	yeah
1	they re sold in diameters
1	not in wattage
1	well i guess wattage as well
1	yes
1	but they tend to be quite close fitting don t they they re not like a bulb which hangs in a space they tend to go into something don t they
1	er they do but a lot of those they as they were originally on anon nametype m type name s disco they weren t necessarily inserted
1	okay
1	in unclear
1	well i ll try and i ll put them unclear advertise unclear but i just think it might be a question we ll get
1	right
1	but i can put them on
1	yes and and the fact that pause dur short presume they work
1	well we can t
1	well if they rattle they don t work and if they all rattle then there s no point
1	we are selling them with trunc guarant trunc we re we re not selling er we aren t giving them away with the guarantee
1	no pause dur short but i mean we could just
1	and some of them
1	trunc sh trunc shake a few
1	yeah well i mean i went through them as much as i could bear
1	yes
1	and if you shake them too much i think you ll break them anyway
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so i mean it s a little self defeating
1	they ve got to stand a little bit of movement because of the er pause dur short fact they re going to travel about
1	are they
1	well somebody s gonna come and get them
1	well yes yes but unclear they re going to be yes once they ve got them home and tested them they trunc m trunc
1	yes
1	may not travel
1	yeah
1	so presumably if it s the same setup as anon type place you put your ad up say this is what i ve got i want it collected by x so i ll say wednesday pause dur short erm and
1	trunc s trunc so are they all erm white you know plain normal
1	no no
1	normal light
1	about a third
1	reflectors yes are they coloured reflectors
1	a few
1	or are they coloured light bulbs
1	er
1	have you got some coloured light bulbs
1	yeah yeah i ve got four four sort of things but if we discount the
1	oh right
1	coloured light bulbs ie things
1	because i ve got rid of quite a few er because er when i went to the tip last with you
1	mm mm
1	they hadn t emptied the light bulbs and there was
1	mm
1	erm an array of anon nametype m type name s
1	mm
1	multicolour light bulbs
1	mm
1	erm vocal desc laugh in on the end of the
1	mm
1	collection looking quite erm jolly
1	mm
1	yes
1	erm so discounting about half a dozen light bulbs which were coloured
1	right yes
1	which were in boxes that said reflectors largely
1	yeah
1	apart from the ones that claim to be pearl light bulbs
1	mm
1	which obviously weren t
1	you see the ones that
1	there s a there s three types there s coloured reflectors
1	yeah
1	small white reflector small white reflector large
1	yes because those light boxes that erm anon nametype f type name is going to take away
1	mm
1	have light bulbs in them which are light bulbs that would work
1	mm
1	but there s not a lot of point in taking them out unless somebody wants to stand and unscrew them all
1	which are what are they light large reflectors small reflectors
1	i would imagine they re probably ordinary light bulbs
1	oh light bulbs okay well i think probably people trunc d trunc i don t know how much they use ordinary light bulbs
1	although they may have trunc alth trunc are all those are those reflectors all screw or
1	i think they re all screw
1	bayonet
1	screw i think i don t think i found any bayonets
1	right pause dur short that cos that s another thing you need to put whether they re bayonet or screw
1	yeah i think possibly they re always screw
1	but the pause dur short it s not something i use very much
1	anyway if somebody s interested then we can have a more detailed conversation with them if necessary
1	yes what i mean is it s it s good deal to have actually have the answer
1	mm
1	cos i hadn t thought about that
1	mm if we haven t got the answer we can find out
1	and we haven t got trunc w trunc
1	it all seems a bit trunc lai trunc more laid back than the erm anon type place where you put an advert up and by the time you ve sent it you ve got three people
1	three phone calls
1	phoning and saying
1	yes
1	i ll come now or can i come now
1	cos we might have to put some of those small speakers on on vocal desc laugh i was gonna say on freeview what am i talking about
1	freecycle
1	freecyle vocal desc laugh yes
1	yes
1	mm as well if nobody wants them
1	mm
1	just to see if anybody wants to take them
1	have you got a phone number for that guy who s meant to be emailing us anon nametype m type name
1	he s the anon type place branch
1	yeah trunc ha trunc have you got his phone number
1	i ve got the anon type place branch number
1	well can you phone him up phone him up and ask if trunc h trunc if he received the email alright and that ll remind him who you are and then you ll know if he s there or not and if he s got the email
1	right
1	cos we trunc mi trunc you ll until you know somebody s got an email you might be trunc w trunc waiting for a response for something that hasn t got to them
1	yes well that s what he told me to do to do er to get
1	yeah but you know just contact him at
1	mm
1	i can look the number up perhaps if you haven t got it
1	no i ve got it on a piece of paper
1	yeah okay
1	on all of my lists over there
1	mm
1	can t think of what else we might have been putting on freecycle
1	well let s just let s just see how we go i don t know how dynamic it is here they seem to be going into quite a lot of detail with what s happened to things it s
1	what they report do they
1	well they they say when things are taken in a
1	oh right
1	like in anon type place they just assume like just kind of assume i think
1	oh
1	you know so erm we ll see
1	unclear right unclear
1	erm pause dur short and pause dur short you want to make some choices over the candles or do you want me to well you want to take out some candles and i ll take the rest to anon nametype f type name
1	well i ll show you what there are just
1	okay brilliant
1	cos erm cos they re like a plummy colour
1	mm
1	or well whitey cream cream really i suppose
1	mm well you keep what you need for sure
1	well i haven t used any for years
1	mm anon nametype m type name doesn t like candles in his house so i don t tend to use them
1	no
1	but erm
1	well i don t
1	i might keep a couple of white ones because i have got actually got some pause dur short i might you know i trunc m trunc life s been a bit difficult over the last few years so you know i haven t it s like i hadn t vocal desc laugh gone round to finish my bag of radishes because
1	yes
1	i hadn t got the like i was saying i haven t eaten any radishes and i haven t tended to bother with them because when i had got them i hadn t got them when i was at work i erm wasn t getting through you know i was
1	yes
1	buying them and thinking i would eat them and being in too much hurry to do anything about them and then last year or the year i didn t think to ask anybody to put them in my shopping when i wasn t doing my own shopping
1	yeah
1	didn t think oh i fancy some radishes so there s things in life that i might quite like but have passed me by because either i was at work and hadn t got time to do it or was too poorly to be bothered with them i suppose
1	yeah
1	or to think of them
1	mm
1	but er i wouldn t mind some just white candles cos they can be quite nice
1	right well they re not white white cream
1	well i will review them pause dur short but i m trying not to collect too many things cos it s easy to think one would like things and then one finds life goes on perfectly well without them
1	yes i can t think of anything else that you were immediately going to unclear
1	okay well we can make a start on that and if you to perhaps get get hold of that chap see if he s around or his colleagues might know when he s trunc ne trunc next in work
1	well they said he was around for a fortnight
1	yes but he might not be even they might have let him have some days off
1	no but no i don t
1	mm
1	he may
1	mm
1	be going on holiday i don t know
1	mm
1	it s all
1	and let me know if you want me to text actually not text i m not good at texting if you want me to email anon nametype f type name for you
1	well i don t at the moment so i ll
1	okay
1	just send her a happy birthday
1	okay pause dur short i m just a bit worried if you send an email i mean there s pros and cons to it but
1	yes
1	if you send an email she might email you back
1	i ll send an email
1	which could encourage you to look at your email more but might not
1	i ve trunc sen trunc well i haven t had time to look at my email
1	no i know you ve had a lot on
1	erm pause dur short i shall trunc em trunc i trunc f trunc if i email her i can
1	mm
1	write at the bottom pause dur short to contact me via text or phone
1	mm
1	which some of my neighbours know not to if they send me a text they if they send me an email they trunc s trunc usually tell me i ve got one
1	yes
1	text me to tell me to look at it now i did send anon nametype f type name one a little while ago so whether she will now start emailing me i don t know
1	mm erm something to do later is look again at the email that came from that erm anon nametype m type name chap
1	anon nametype m type name chap
1	is it anon nametype m type name
1	anon nametype m type name who s anon nametype m type name
1	oh well anyway we ll sort it out later but
1	unclear
1	the trunc o trunc thing we were talking about with anon nametype f type name pause dur short those emails
1	oh right
1	yeah anyway
1	yes i don t think i ve got all of those
1	no
1	but i trunc d trunc
1	perhaps perhaps some came to me but anyway
1	well no they wouldn t come trunc t trunc
1	we ll we ll look
1	no they wouldn t come to you unless they were talking about something in general the ones from him wouldn t have come to you
1	no no none of them came from him they always they all came via somebody else
1	yes
1	but erm oh we need to look at the emails to be sure so erm pause dur short do you want to give that person a ring in case they close early on saturday
1	yes well i can do some time
1	yeah okay event desc abrupt end
0	it is good but i find pause dur short like people rave on about it a bit too much
0	because in some bits of it i do find it a bit long
0	i really like hank and mike
0	yeah i didn t like him at first at all
0	yeah
0	do you like that
0	the the first couple of episodes i remember it coming on channel five and i was like that looks so shit
0	like years ago but it s actually quite good
0	he plays a convincing american though
0	who s the convincing american
0	and er vocal desc laugh but he s in he s in that pacific rim but i haven t seen it
0	yeah
0	mm
0	sure
0	everything s like enlarged on him
0	pretty much yeah yeah
0	he s a fucking
0	he s like scared of dogs and
0	he s a fucking creep yeah but he s actually got quite a fun character
0	yeah opie s cool pause dur short erm what he had and they killed donna didn t they he kind of let that slide unless that comes back pause dur short i was surprised that he didn t do shit to event desc unintelligible
0	you need to watch it man it gets so much better pause dur short but erm what else have we watched oh mate we ve watched some stuff we genuinely like so like it s been alright pause dur short but girls like things a lot more civilised you know i mean
0	yeah
0	ran and got through trunc t trunc two seasons and then it got cut and it was pretty shit
0	no no falling skies is alright man
0	i haven t really given it a try
0	did we watch that
0	yeah i mean we watched fucking angel man vocal desc laugh
0	like what way
0	have you heard of that unclear serburn unclear serbian film it s blooming fucking horrible it s like in black and white and he s an ex porn star and he does like pause dur short fucks all and mate some horrible things mate some i can t erm even remember mate but it s all like incest and fucking murder and shit like that
0	no i haven t heard of that

0	because anon nametype f type name s like don t show them vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	pretty graphic
0	fucking bad man when they skin that fox and he s still alive
0	yeah vocal desc laugh i remember you getting a bit like
0	i don t wanna see anymore
0	no
0	no that s nothing that s got nothing to do with food though it s just
0	outlook on yeah just trunc na trunc er nature around us
0	do you know what i mean
0	and made that transition from nomadic to farming then
0	you ve got to use technology to get beyond
0	over thousands of years of that happening you then have things like religion in the mix and they say like in the bible that you have erm trunc mus trunc you have pause dur short i can t remember what how they say it what they it was now but basically they say you have domain or something so over like pause dur short erm trunc pla trunc er animals or domestic and pets and shit like that pause dur short oh no pet the feral and fucking domestic so or something
0	what were we talking about again i ve just forgotten
0	because they re not using pesticides and it s cheaper to do it this way etcetera etcetera but i mean if you mass produced organic food
0	mm
0	it would bring the price down because you re doing more of it
0	mm
0	cos the the ground is already polluted
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	into that that way of thinking
0	mm
0	and they did it in a situation where they were gonna go to war and people were gonna die so we ve gone through that trunc scen trunc scenario before in the second world war and the first world war
0	we get but now as we ve got so many people on this island that if we tried that we wouldn t feed everyone
0	yeah we obviously import
0	well why english is perfect potato growing land and what i don t what i find strange when i fly in pause dur short is that there is we live all so cramped together and feel like we re really really over populated and we are really over populated but there s still so many trunc f trunc so much farmland when you fly in england is just green all over
0	now like now i mean like i work as a gardener there is loads of factors what you can take into account first of all you ve got the weather and the weather is changing
0	and then also there is loads of like pause dur short pests hundreds of pests different diseases loads of them different fungal event desc unintelligible
0	not just farm along to farm up event desc unintelligible hydroponic
0	yeah
0	unclear basque
0	fucking pigeons it s like the british association for shooting and trunc conserv trunc
0	no no you re thinking of basque isn t it
0	anyway
0	but what i m saying about having a small organic garden per community or whatever
0	if you took england when i was saying when you re flying in and it we re all living very close together and under the illusion that you know we re having to import in all this stuff and we can t grow very much but yet i see fields everywhere which makes me think if you just spread out where we live so instead of us living
0	yeah but mate what you re seeing is not all edible
0	oh what you re saying is if everyone grows yeah but
0	it s it s making the money as well it s making the money
0	if you had a plot of land between your small community or something
0	no enough food to supplement so you could trunc st trunc you could live off still off importing but you didn t you weren t it wasn t a problem if
0	erm i don t think you need to live off wheat i m talking about smaller things like the community of like say twenty to thirty to fifty to a hundred people have a small farm that they all manage
0	mm
0	therefore that they don t need to put much time into it because they can still do their job because everyone s managing it
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	you know strawberries
0	do you know what that s called that s called intercropping
0	i m just saying it s possible here
0	because at the minute we re all just like we can t farm around here where are we gonna walk to through the unclear chavs unclear unclear to fields where the
0	i just think
0	you have to have a very on board on board view everyone has to think that pause dur short if you ve got a weak in the chain it doesn t work pause dur short do you know what i mean pause dur short if everyone didn t think that you d have unclear wasted and it you wouldn t really get the right results
0	unclear communism
0	i don t think communism has existed erm in the world outside of traveller societies pause dur short since the invention of capitalism which happened a lot longer ago than they seem to think it did pause dur short i think since the agro industrial revolution of like five thousand years ago we ve effectively been capitalist and only in erm tribal societies unclear and gates unclear connected from that and they re still able to they have a form of communism
0	it s terrible trust me all my friends are like you know one single event desc unintelligible

0	is there
0	yeah there s a rain maker somewhere
0	a rendang it s an indonesian slash malaysian curry it s the best it s the best curry in the world i m convinced of it it s like beef chunks you high fry them to like sear them and then i use tamarind kaffir lime lemongrass erm a bit of brown sugar goes quite well in it as well that s the only time i add sugar as well i cook sometime with curry but you like you add a lot of coconut cream to it and then cook it really really low for about four hours until right at the end there s like no sauce left it s just like a really thick dark black paste on it or like a kind of dark brown almost reddy sometimes it s really sweet for curries it s really really good
0	and then like erm turn it up really high right at the end to like caramelise it in the beef fat erm or the lamb if you have it

0	i wonder how they made this like carved the the centre pause dur long
0	it s one whole bit of wood
0	do the trill
0	i think that s cos you have to add one after the other

0	that had the monocle
0	yeah
0	same place
0	shit anon type place is just outside isn t it
0	but i m like a five minute walk from anon type place station
0	and there d be like a big movement to say
0	yeah
0	i realised that there s they just if you ve
0	i know but some people don t think about where that is
0	the rest is anon type place and then all the way on the other end anon type place is really quite similar actually from us
0	where were you going for that unclear slinky unclear
1	i can t i don t know what pause dur short there s no spare pause dur long i m gonna sleep in in the study when they come pause dur short is it thursday
1	you can have your own bed they they there are only two of them coming they ll sleep in my bed
1	they don t want to share a bed surely
1	they re used to it
1	well i m used to sleeping on the floor i in fact i d almost prefer it because my separate out of the way
1	you re not you don t need to do anything they can have my bed it s only one night and when they come back it s one night
1	yeah but what if they don t sleep the night before travelling that wouldn t be a good idea would it pause dur long how come there s only one piece of carrot
1	because there wasn t any carrot this is this is what was erm left over from yesterday pause dur long
1	oh what time s the flight
1	two forty five
1	mm have you got the rail tickets
1	not yet pause dur long there re gonna they ll get their tickets to gatwick when they arrive here erm
1	why
1	cos they ve got passes i suppose they could they could buy them from any railway station couldn t they
1	but what s the advantage of oh yeah the theoretical yes pause dur long
1	oh erm trunc wh trunc when i come up on tuesday do i should i get a travel card how how many tube journeys are we going to be making
1	three
1	oh it s worth getting one then
1	cos he ll cos you won t want to walk to piccadilly you won t have time
1	no
1	and then there ll be piccadilly to south kensington and then back from south kensington to victoria
1	yeah i thought so
1	well do you know where this restaurant is
1	yes i ve looked on erm the map
1	where
1	is it anon type place something like that it s just off erm piccadilly isn t it
1	yes it is but it s confusing and erm isn t it erm near anon type place
1	unclear no unclear
1	well i think it is anyway it s confusing because it s not a big street it s probably not clearly signposted and the restaurant is erm in the basement
1	erm
1	so you won t see a restaurant probably on at street level
1	there must be something outside which which says that the restaurant s there what s it called anon type place or something pause dur short yeah
1	there probably is but you know what it s like in that area there s loads of street furniture and street signs
1	mm
1	well erm i recommend that you have a look at the menu today or tomorrow cos it ll be up for the week
1	ah
1	and decide before you go and that ll save a lot of time
1	mm
1	cos if they go away cos they wouldn t cos they unclear then they may not come back for a long time
1	yes we just unclear one immediately unclear to unclear sit down
1	no pause dur long and that includes erm drinks because nobody ever seems prepared to order drinks and that ll that could cause a long delay thinking about what about whether whether or not you want a drink or just have tap water
1	mm pause dur long and the concert finishes about ten o clock i suppose
1	mm
1	so i should be able to get the quarter to eleven train out of victoria
1	vocal desc cough well you might even be able to get the twenty two seventeen er it officially finishes at erm nine fifty
1	oh right
1	and that s the erm estimate but
1	yeah depending how quickly you can get out
1	the yes exactly and i might have erm well you can go ahead if you want to erm cos i suppose i ll need to take erm small case
1	oh cos you re going up to erm cambridge aren t you unclear
1	yeah i can t really i don t know how i can t i can t use that bag any more have you seen the state of it
1	oh you mean that s like strap
1	rucksack
1	oh the rucksack no i haven t seen the state of it why what s wrong with it
1	well it s falling to pieces literally things have
1	is that the one you got in australia
1	yes it s things in that yeah in that arcade things are falling out of it erm loose stuff is falling out because it s all it s ripped it s got holes in pause dur long
1	no there s plenty of places where it can get you get a new one they re quite cheap
1	well i thought i d get i thought i d have a look in tesco that s where i got the one before and that trunc la trunc that was quite that that was quite good quality it seemed to last a long time
1	mm
1	that one that was with a mouse that we never used it was for unclear it was for laptops or something
1	no pause dur short mm the best rucksack i had i got from marks and spencer and it was only fifteen pounds and it unclear lasted ages
1	yeah was it a sale or what
1	erm don t think well it might have been yeah it might have been in a sale
1	you can t erm vocal desc cough you can t trust marks and spencer though they automatically you think of that that erm umbrella that i got
1	yes i know i i bought one
1	it s rubbish
1	i told you didn t i i took it back
1	oh you took yours back
1	i took mine back and i said i d only had it a couple of weeks and he said yes it looks new and i showed him what was wrong with it and he cos i he said you should take it up to customer services and they ll probably exchange it for you cos i was just gonna buy a new one
1	and did you have your receipt
1	no that s why i was just gonna buy a new one cos i hadn t got the receipt with me and i needed a brolly urgently cos it was very it was raining very heavily it was my lunchtime the umbrella had broken
1	which marks and spencer was this then
1	anon type place
1	you mean anon type place
1	mm
1	well how come you were up there that s nowhere near your work
1	it is i was i was out in my lunchbreak i think
1	surely you don t walk that far in your lunchbreak
1	yeah it s not far
1	it s down one hill and up another hill
1	yeah so what i often do that
1	vocal desc cough ah i suppose it s good in
1	yeah i like to you know get get a good walk in
1	mm
1	i don t do it every day but erm pause dur short i do it maybe once er maybe twice a week
1	mm
1	just walk up to churches where that that area and then back then sometimes i walk along the seafront and then up
1	mm
1	is it anon type place street and back through the town centre or vice versa
1	vocal desc cough anon type place street pause dur long anyway so i m going i ll i ll probably take that case and no rucksack but it ll be a nuisance because i suppose i ll have to check it into the cloakroom
1	mm you would
1	and that means
1	more time
1	at the end it could cause a delay in leaving and then you don t know how long the applause will take and if they do an encore
1	mm trunc tr trunc
1	i think it s unlikely isn t it because erm encores would usually be for soloists that would be the first half wouldn t it
1	mm i can t remember the programme now what what is it the rachmaninov a symphony second pause dur long
1	and a new composition pause dur long
1	a new composition by some russian
1	chinese
1	ah yes pause dur long is anon nametype m type name going to that one
1	he s not going to it any more
1	oh pause dur short there s not many left anyway
1	well yeah i think it finishes next saturday doesn t it
1	mm no maybe it was the saturday after it s about the twelfth twelfth of september isn t it
1	i don t know
1	thirteenth i think s the last one pause dur long
1	anyway vocal desc cough i ll erm i ll probably take her i can take her circle line as far as victoria when you go afterwards
1	mm
1	if it s convenient and then i ll change but erm my train i ll expect i ll get the quarter to eleven train
1	right
1	cos i don t think i d make the erm i doubt if i d make the ten fifteen because it s a long walk to the tube
1	right
1	that s the problem with that place pause dur long yeah it does it
1	what place the royal albert hall
1	well yes and and south kensington tube station where they it takes a long time to walk there pause dur short it doesn t look far but it is it takes you know ten fifteen minutes doesn t it
1	and there ll be loads of people doing the same thing pause dur long
1	well i wonder whether there s any point in doing it
1	what rush it
1	no i mean going at all it s supposed to be to celebrate birthday but the whole thing is meaningless pause dur long
1	what do you mean the whole thing is meaningless unclear to celebrate birthdays with having a meal and enjoy the concert pause dur short it just means erm
1	it s no no where it s weeks vocal desc cough it s weeks after the event and there s no relationship is there
1	it s alright pause dur short you probably wouldn t have done it were it not for birthdays pause dur long
1	do you want erm pineapple or erm plums or an orange
1	unclear do those erm mandarins need using up
1	yeah
1	cos i saw one looked a bit black a bit manky yes
1	well anyway you probably wouldn t want to eat it but anyway do you want a mandarin and something
1	yeah i ll have a mandarin yes pause dur long
1	they re not gonna taste very nice are they if they haven t been
1	well if they re not very nice i won t eat it
1	no i mean because they ve been in the fridge
1	oh they ll be cold yes pause dur long
1	anyway this is this is from yesterday they brought a very strange selection of fruit i i wonder who decides these things because erm last a week a week yesterday there was one red apple green apples and erm mm don t know whether there were mandarins or not but anyway yesterday there were only green apples and oranges
1	mm
1	and trunc ever trunc everybody knows that people don t like oranges cos they re messy
1	yeah
1	erm and erm and the sandwiches were quite strange as well cos i i remember erm last last week there were erm i don t are they called shrimp or prawn
1	prawn probably
1	and trunc may trunc yeah sandwiches but erm i think they re quite expensive aren t they prawns anyway there was nothing like that
1	yeah
1	there was there was tinned salmon and cucumber er yesterday that was quite nice because of the cucumber
1	mm
1	that was the nicest and then there was also some cheddar sort of erm what do you call it when the cheddar is put through a sieve pause dur short grated
1	grated cheese
1	grated cheese sandwiches and probably had bits mm anyway pause dur short there s nothing to write home about
1	brown bread or white
1	oh i don t know there s trunc no trunc nothing properly brown pause dur short there was definitely white there and there was something that was off white pause dur long and there was enough an average of probably there was enough for everybody to have three hearts which in a way was sufficient because i think they add olive oil or something to fill you up unclear
1	yeah yeah
1	they used to do that at anon type place the the sandwiches were actually indigestible
1	mm
1	they they they d look alright and then you d eat them and you d suddenly feel queasy maybe it was salmonella
1	mm vocal desc cough i d have thought if it was something like salmonella you d have had pain and vomiting
1	yeah well i remember taking it up with them i think i might have found out i think i might have asked one of the people serving what was in them
1	so did you need to eat your own sandwiches that you took pause dur short as well
1	yesterday
1	yeah or did you have that at in the evening or something
1	i had them on the train
1	oh
1	on the way home i didn t i told you it was a we weren t moving around we were tied vocal desc cough we were just sat behind a desk for pause dur long from nine o clock till four or five o clock
1	yes
1	it s horrible and and also in the afternoon for the first time cos of security erm they it was like an exam we had to move the desks from the horseshoe shape to exam style
1	oh yes
1	a metre a metre apart plus we got given different erm sets of paper anyway and you know that bloke from anon type place pause dur short who i told you about
1	erm which one i can t remember
1	anyway erm once again did it rather like last saturday erm i heard a i heard a noise and it throwing things into his bag and stuff and he walked out and he just like he just just zipped through it and finished in an hour or something
1	oh
1	i thought that was strange i mean you can you you could do that you could probably do that pause dur short you could do that in an on an ordinary working saturday but that that was that was more you had to get it right if you didn t if you don t get it right you have to re do it so i thought that was a bit of a risk taking that attitude
1	mm maybe it s maybe it s it s all stuff he s done for years and years and years
1	yeah but i know he s a new person
1	oh really
1	he might have been doing it before somewhere else but
1	mm strange
1	it s just his attitude anyway i was one of the last people there and makes me think maybe my brain is slowing down
1	it s probably just more conscientious
1	i dunno pause dur short it s true that if there s a deadline then you speed up and there wasn t actually there wasn t a deadline particularly you could theoretically i think you could have carried on till seven o clock
1	mm
1	if you d wanted to
1	and were you the last person
1	no i was the last but one
1	mm
1	or the last but two cos when i finished somebody else finished as well
1	mm
0	but luckily like it was kind of comfy there and it was cheap and like the toilet was good so it wasn t too bad unclear
0	no cos the fan was massive but in battambang it was horrible
0	yeah
0	no
0	i recommended a few antibiotics to you and then the next thing i knew was that you d been taking them
0	and found that ciprofloxacin
0	the ciprofloxacin yeah
0	yeah just don t get into the habit of taking them every time you get sick you know cos it s there s not much you could do probably
0	yeah but that sorted me out and then i i went zip lining

0	but then because they go on your hips and kind of stick forward a bit don t they
0	then you can see a line around the bottom of the dress
0	right
0	which you can see
0	no pause dur short cos the zip ripples
0	mm
0	like doesn t hold pause dur short cos that s too big now too
0	so as i move it trunc wr trunc trunc wr trunc trunc wr trunc wriggles up
0	mm
0	yes
0	will be sixty four pause dur short cos i think i have er a gift voucher for topshop that s about four quid or something
0	yeah pause dur short so it s gonna be like probably looking at a hundred and fifty quid aren t you pause dur short for a birthday outfit pause dur short which is fine because normally a dress would cost that
0	but
0	what s gone before
0	mm
0	yes
0	i want one of those pause dur short a black one pause dur short black shoes pause dur short black bag pause dur short black fascinator pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	i think actually they might ve done one this colour the black
0	mm
0	well they just thought they d send a letter to my old address pause dur short cos that s nicer
0	yeah pause dur short i said
0	yeah
0	you let your dad open your bank statements
0	er yeah
0	um for the month pause dur short and they charged me something like over a month and a half a pound a day for a month and a half pause dur short and
0	that wasn t my overdraft that i signed up for pause dur short they ve changed the terms without telling me
0	no pause dur short go ahead
0	um
0	didn t question it pause dur short put a hundred quid in to cover it
0	um pause dur short went back a couple of days later and he said by the way you re due another charge trunc b trunc for being over in the last quarter something something
0	so i thought do you know what i ll just pay it in pause dur short suck it up
0	how is that possible
0	for over your overdraft
0	it needs to leave
0	um pause dur short quite quite a lot of blue fluff
0	um pause dur short tut pause dur short we might need to eat cake
0	yeah
0	and then because i was over my overdraft it must be trunc someth trunc something had happened before pause dur short there s a sixty pound charge
0	um pause dur short then
0	then they took a hundred and fifty pounds
0	i put this in
0	i can spend some money pause dur short no i can t spend money pause dur short because on the twenty first a hundred and thirty two quid pause dur short one one charge pause dur short i was like what the fuck i don t know what that returned bounce is pause dur short i don t know what that is pause dur short either way pause dur short and then another one of sixty pound pause dur short and then the latest one of a hundred and eighty
0	yeah
0	i mean i ve i
0	just to keep you within
0	all these paid outs all these paids outs account account account account are all going to my other natwest account
0	mm
0	mm
0	and they think that s okay
0	cos with hsbc if i go over my overdraft it s thirty five pounds
0	are you gonna you re just gonna have to speak to them and say what the hell do you think you re doing i mean really it doesn t seem like this account is doing you any favours
0	well absolutely pause dur short the bank charges are disgusting pause dur short but really what they what your bank if they were responsible would be saying to you is you ve got an account where you ve got a basic salary coming in pause dur short use that as your current account pause dur short and very slowly over the months decrease it so you re
0	unclear
0	that s what you re doing
0	right
0	right
0	so when i moved the new job i stopped it cos they d fucked me over pause dur short you know when i was unclear bank card
0	god i d forgotten about all that
0	i don t know
0	oh yes pause dur short i have horrendous credit rating pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	yep pause dur short like as in
0	horrendous
0	mm
0	well i ve spoken to this guy before pause dur short every single time i ve had a complaint
0	and his name s anon nametype m type name pause dur short i know him pause dur short he s shit at life
0	and he s the escalator to his boss to the regional boss and to
0	their head office in anon type place
0	good pause dur short huh
0	that s really helpful pause dur short um pause dur short oh i d have thought they
0	so
0	but er have you got internet banking
0	mm
0	bank statements pause dur short so maybe in that case they keep all of that electronically on your
0	maybe
0	and i would try and find that out before you go in tomorrow pause dur short cos then at least you can
0	okay
0	say it to their face
0	i m escalating this to this person because
0	that s it
0	yeah the but the thing is the bank will charge you an instant fee for for breaking terms of your
0	the terms pause dur short yeah
0	five hundred pause dur short and then at this point where they charge me a hundred and thirty two
0	a percentage of how much you re over pause dur short because i m only over a hundred and thirty eight pounds it s a percentage of that against the five hundred pause dur short because obviously once they put another charge on and i m four hundred pounds over
0	yeah yeah yeah pause dur short apr that s like twelve you know two thousand percent
0	on the account usually is like really low pause dur short that s why i ve always kept it and always paid it off
0	i think it is their error pause dur short because i just can t see how that can be a charge pause dur short even if it s the initial charge for breaking your overdraft agreement and then the interest there s no way that it can be a hundred and eighty pounds in the space of not even four months pause dur short trunc e trunc cos that s only one charge pause dur short or maybe it s two charges pause dur short that s the conversation that you remember having
0	mm
0	mm
0	isn t it
0	completely forgot where it was despite the fact i live just off it
0	and made anon nametype m type name and anon nametype n type name drive to anon type place

0	an order to the letter pause dur short like they will not question it pause dur short and basically the officers who are there pause dur short they don t do the dogsbody work pause dur short they re not the ones that actually go round killing people pause dur short they re the ones who sort of put the plans in motion

0	mm
0	than it might be
0	like most places
0	somewhere else yeah pause dur long but no it would be interesting to see what he thinks about the whole isis thing
0	i can imagine he d feel quite angry
0	but i wouldn t directly say hey anon nametype m type name what do you think of the
0	got ages
0	oh wow how does she feel about it being in her last year is she gonna miss uni do you think or is she just
0	cos they re kind of newly anon nametype n type name group erm and they re sort of erm they re in the spotlight now
0	which they weren t before so they are just using it and they re just using all the students to you know churn out success but not actually caring at all about
0	yeah
0	she says
0	yeah she is yeah she and
0	so

0	god
0	oh awesome
0	yeah
0	yeah yeah definitely
0	and when you like put it together with a university that s the cause of it all the time it s just they need to just look at that and think
0	yeah which is
0	it s yeah
0	yeah definitely yeah
0	it s almost kind of a side effect isn t it yeah
0	yeah
0	i think also it s because we have more kind of understanding of mental illness
0	mm
0	people have definitely become more aware of it
0	yeah
0	mm
0	doesn t sound strange it s like i don t really get the
0	thing of not really knowing that you are depressed
0	cos it s like you ve dealt with it for so long that you can just sort of
0	yeah
0	so that was like trunc s trunc sort of like whatsit it was a reactive depression
0	mm
0	yeah
0	treating it except with medication obviously if it
0	about your eating disorder cos my friend like she had trouble with it and then it sort of came back and
0	i feel like
0	mm
0	you kind of just shut down like your whole body and it kind of just like gives you this like
0	whereas if you re kind of like i dunno if you re just like helping yourself like if you re like at a healthy weight and you re like stuff it s just like do you know what i mean
0	mm
0	i mean this is the one
0	that s good

0	enough to know that

0	erm there we are that s what you were talking about
0	yeah
0	no pause dur short most of them just look a bit mm pause dur short there s like westies or terriers they re all a bit yappy and a bit bitey i don t really like them
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i love how she hates it though vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh i know
0	but that s a classic case of a really really loved family pet dies so they buy a new dog and then they all just hate it cos it s this horrible mean dog vocal desc laugh that bites everyone
0	is that alfie alfie s the current dog
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	so he was about seventeen i think pause dur short cos when he got very old he went to live er with his with their nan pause dur short cos they were out at the time and stuff
0	ah
0	is it five
0	then maybe you won t
0	loads of calls
0	yeah nothing particularly exciting but just pause dur short it s like the girl who i ve taken over from has left literally the shittiest instructions
0	ever
0	she obviously thinks she s very unclear important unclear
0	when we retire it ll slow down
0	yeah true pause dur short mum okay she found out today that she is gonna be made redundant
0	yeah i had all that lowdown when she was here what she like
0	yeah when i was late
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh no it won t be good for her but it
0	like a lazy person who has no like obligation to do anything
0	and they were like oh this isn t our department so can you call back and i was like okay that s really helpful and they weren t really unclear anyway it s like unclear
0	and then i rang the council and they said for me to ring citizens advice even though unclear
0	okay
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	she was actually quite rude and it really got on my nerves
0	she could
0	if we haven t met the contract
0	which no offence if she s not gonna actually make er she s not gonna take the whole erm repossession seriously i doubt if she ll take us to court but i get the point yeah
0	yeah
0	i mean we re not about to go to court
0	sort of said erm if we re in a trunc bi trunc i think it s basically what we said before if we re in a binding contract then the people that the lender will take over pause dur short with the rent paying
0	yeah
0	tenancy
0	tenancy mortgage erm and we can find that out the agency might know that or pause dur short we
0	yeah
0	cos i m not i i don t know
0	it s really hard so pause dur short unclear hang on unclear let me just think about this so that was that erm i asked about the in fact i looked at the contract again i i did talk to her about the contract and trunc t trunc and said about that thing and she said well erm if it says that then erm pause dur short because it s a contract you still have to pay because it s a contract
0	vocal desc laugh
0	if it s not in writing as well
0	yeah
0	what in december
0	no we wouldn t cos the lender would probably it would be in our their interest to get us out anyway so
0	oh i see so
0	so what does the surrender include what does it
0	no i know but it s got to be something from their interests for it to happen so for example they ve got new tenants coming or erm i don t know she wants a month to redecorate or something like it s got to be something that s in their interest
0	and i ve i ve confirmed that with her anyway and she said that s fine
0	cos they are the ones that are releasing us from the tenancy
0	yeah
0	if they have that information but again if they d protections in for this into this they might not give us that information anyway
0	cos i very much think it s unfair that if they re that s if we move out and the the new tenants move in like the day before and they haven t
0	probably not cos it s gonna come out by by post so it won t come out like trunc w trunc we won t know on the fourteenth cos we haven t got the rights to that information
0	no
0	i know they don t know whether they re coming or going really
0	but then i think they ve got the rights haven t they so i think they were they knew but i think that since this has happened pause dur short they ve changed the goalpost which they are actually entitled to do
0	but they were so sneaky about that i think
0	which trunc wasn trunc yeah saying we can t do that vocal desc laugh
0	well we can ask could we pay up until january the first or pay up until december the thirty first and then the new tenant pays on the first well and give and ask the estate agents to offer the new tenants the option of moving in you know straight away in january
0	but the estate agent is so shit
0	no pause dur short i think she s quite hard to track down though
0	mm
0	yeah i guess well until after er but unclear pause dur long
1	yeah it is a bit cold erm
1	it s very cold and there s a thick fog isn t there was it still on the ground it was when you went and did you get the bus
1	well yes i did but not at the time you said
1	oh what time which bus
1	well you said you said seven forty seven yeah
1	yeah
1	and it eventually came at five past eight
1	oh that s a different bus then
1	well the when i got to the bus stop it trunc wa trunc it was sixteen minutes past it said bus due in sixteen minutes
1	oh and that was the five trunc wa trunc was that the five or the five a
1	that was the first that was the five a
1	oh
1	and erm
1	mm oh well they ve changed the bus timetable in the winter but i don t know or what to
1	yeah well it s
1	but that was on that was online this morning wasn t it how weird never mind the main thing is you got a bus but you got there in time did you
1	yeah i got there about erm twenty to and er there were three people waiting apparently one a really nice chap and we started a conversation and we were chatting about this and that
1	oh
1	he was there because he was er his landlady refused to get the heating fixed
1	oh
1	and he wanted to find out what recourse he had and because he was wouldn t let it go she gave him his notice two months notice and he went down and i saw him when he came out and he says he s stuffed unclear
1	nothing you can do
1	no
1	i think you know it s amazing isn t it what people can do and there s nothing you can do to make unclear nothing you can do to make things make them unclear
1	apparently not erm they ve got they ve got a rent agreement that s and i unclear presumably she s in er
1	yeah the landlord unclear
1	yeah she she s in the wrong there you know because she she s has agreed to do what she said she would do but apparently the bottom line is that she s got the rights and he hasn t so yeah
1	and the heating s not been working but is that a boiler or what what is that unclear a boiler or
1	i don t know he didn t trunc s trunc say exactly what it was but there s a there s a problem with the heating and erm he said they they couldn t er pause dur short they couldn t make her do anything so she she
1	to sort it out
1	yeah trunc sh trunc she she gave him the two months notice and presumably er she ll do nothing about the heating
1	she ll have to when the new tenant goes in surely
1	i don t know i don t know
1	very odd anyway how did you get on
1	well erm unclear we re given a number and i was number four i had to wait again unclear
1	it s quite a long time isn t it
1	yeah nearly erm nearly an hour
1	do you want something to eat
1	mm i would actually
1	what would you like
1	erm well anything thanks
1	well do you want a sandwich now or do you want
1	anything honestly anon nametype f type name
1	porridge or
1	trunc any trunc anything

1	a bit late for porridge vocal desc laugh er so erm then it was just putting on the computer my details and she said well what do you want to to see us about
1	everything vocal desc laugh
1	and well yeah that on the on the form you had to fill in before you go and see them er then you re only allowed to tick one of the items
1	yeah
1	so i i ticked benefits and i told her it was er it s the trunc sit trunc i told her my situation and er she went to see her supervisor
1	yeah they ll have to be
1	and they came back and said well we ll make an appointment at er for somebody to see you tomorrow so i ve got to go back again at half past nine tomorrow

1	yeah erm
1	that s good because it s new year s eve and erm i thought you might not get anything you know until later
1	yeah yeah
1	well that s good then so did you did they talk about anything
1	no not really but i trunc w trunc while i was waiting i was looking through the leaflets that they ve got there booklets and one of the things they said er as looking at er cos i didn t you know i don t know anything about anything like really you know
1	no of course not no
1	and er if you are a pensioner
1	mm
1	you cannot claim jobseeker s allowance
1	no
1	no so
1	well i i did
1	but what i can do is apply for pension credits
1	yeah and top it up
1	yeah so i said you know i want to is it worth erm and i d planned to er i told them my plans to to go down to the pension office after i i left there and said would it i would be er doubling would it be necessary so i was gonna see somebody tomorrow you know and she said well you can go down and tell them what they ve said so i did go down to the pensions people
1	you did
1	and they said oh it s all centralised now
1	yes
1	you have to ring this number
1	mm
1	so then i told him well what i was given the runaround yesterday
1	mm
1	and they said that i d got to ring er one of the numbers that i rang yesterday
1	mm
1	and trunc apparent trunc
1	did they tell you what to ask for though did they cos sometimes unless you re asking for the right thing erm
1	yeah yeah yeah well it s to top up pension erm so
1	ppension credit
1	pension credits yeah so erm
1	well that sounds quite good though doesn t it
1	yeah well if if i can get to talk to somebody er that s what i m gonna do now er or after i ve had something to eat
1	but it s you know these there is some things that you can
1	well yeah i i suppose you know you ve got to two things i learnt today and one is patience and the other is perseverance
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	oh unclear
1	mm well i think that s the way of the world unfortunately because what you re dealing with is they re dealing with is people who aren t working and have got time so therefore you know that s how they are they re because you can wait for me kind of approach
1	yeah
1	did you have to wait there then when you went today
1	no
1	unclear
1	that was vocal desc laugh well it s in the job centre there which is
1	yeah
1	you know right next to the law courts
1	yeah
1	and the first two guys are there are two obviously bouncers
1	yeah security
1	i know yeah erm both playing with their phones
1	oh cool
1	and then you see somebody somebody will come up to you and say oh can i help you
1	mm
1	which is quite nice erm
1	eventually
1	and then you know he told me you know you ve just got to phone you you can t see anybody the only person you could see there is somebody who actually pops in and he said he just pops into the office because essentially his job is going around to see pensioners who can t get out
1	oh right yeah
1	so he said it s all got to be done over the phone
1	mm and they ll probably send you forms and then you ll fill those forms in
1	yeah maybe
1	mm
1	maybe anyway i ll find out later
1	so you ve got you ve got to ring there
1	yeah
1	what time is that so right now it s probably
1	well it s twelve o clock now so
1	yeah you ve got to it s probably lunchtime
1	oh i don t think they that matters about lunchtime erm
1	well unclear
1	cos they got they ve got calls from all over the world coming
1	yeah well unclear
1	i expect they have a staggered lunch you know these
1	yeah yeah
1	maybe it s less chance of getting unclear
1	yeah or yeah
1	what are the chances of them replying in the lunchtime so
1	unclear
1	maybe i should wait a couple of hours
1	yeah well yeah i would say by two o clock anyone going to lunch is coming back now and don t forget between christmas and new year there ll be a skeleton staff
1	mm
1	you know unclear
1	yeah i suppose people do take holidays now it s like that
1	yeah
1	er policewoman that
1	yeah
1	er filled in the form and she said
1	everywhere you go unclear
1	unclear until the twelfth
1	yeah the twelfth mm well i mean the garage that we go to anon nametype m type name s been down there twice to pay them and they re and he went on christmas eve and he went yesterday and they re not open until the fifth of january pause dur short i suppose they know they haven t got anybody booked in and they choose when to have their holidays pause dur short but our erm the guy that runs the garage owns the garage we ve been with him for years and years and he would retire but he s got staff that wanna keep going so he has lots of holidays and they they keep the garage going while he s away
1	mm
1	but anyway pause dur short so your plan is to phone them up and try and get that sorted out
1	yeah
1	you re going back tomorrow
1	mm mm
1	and erm
1	well i ll have a clearer idea of erm
1	mm where to
1	what i ll be entitled to
1	yeah so tomorrow it s a specialist person is it
1	yes it s a
1	mm pause dur short that s good then
1	yeah
1	and did you have to explain about your circumstances like what you ve been doing and you know
1	mm yeah yeah vaguely without going into much detail
1	i mean did you tell them about anon nametype f type name
1	yes they asked me and i said i ve got family in anon type place dependants
1	yeah
1	erm so i expect they ll want unclear to be able to unclear
1	well that
1	take take people unclear
1	you might get child benefit
1	well
1	unclear you don t know unclear
1	maybe if i can prove she exists
1	well that s why i said birth certificates
1	yeah but it s in chinese you see
1	well you know
1	because i i
1	they can be translated
1	but i have got erm the form that says she s registered with the british government as erm british father
1	mm well you you need to have a copy of her birth certificate and they will translate it over here
1	ah
1	if need be and that that s why i said to you you need it as proof and you could be i mean i don t know how much erm family allowance is but it s quite a lot about ten pounds or more it might be even
1	is it
1	i don t know it might be even eighteen pounds a week which is a lot if you ve got to pay school fees
1	mm
1	and
1	well we ll trunc s trunc i ll see tomorrow what they say and if i need it or not or if if pause dur short but these pension credits er it seems like that s
1	that s the way to go
1	that s
1	what you need to find out about also have you they asked about trunc you trunc your savings
1	trunc y trunc they will do but
1	yeah
1	it s it s all done on a on a scale here see there look
1	mm okay god it s hard to follow isn t it
1	mm
1	the pension credits chart for people age you re not single actually
1	no well the different
1	yeah
1	well
1	people aged sixty five and over
1	yeah but i m not a couple either am i
1	no so you god unclear get the credit pause dur short your income pause dur short is rock bottom isn t it then vocal desc laugh
1	well my income will be just what i m being paid
1	on the pension
1	on the pension at the moment so
1	yeah
1	i m pretty
1	and it starts at a hundred
1	yeah a hundred yeah
1	unclear and a hundred pounds
1	yeah
1	but you re below the scale
1	mm i m trunc pr trunc i m pretty sure that
1	you will get
1	i ll get something
1	well yeah mm it s that
1	and they asked me if i m paying any rent and i said no i m just er staying with my sister at the moment
1	but you or what you have you asked them will you get housing benefit if you want to take a flat you know
1	yes yeah and and
1	unclear
1	anon nametype m type name s been pushing me to he said well get your trunc hou trunc get your name down on the housing list
1	well
1	i said what
1	forget that forget that they unclear
1	i saw a thing on the tv recently er that said in in anon type place there s a is it sixteen thousand people on the housing list or something like that
1	yeah well they re mainly people with children and unclear
1	yeah
1	you know and and they have to be overcrowded if you can put your name down on the housing list here we re not overcrowded
1	mm
1	so that s you know that s what they would say well you ve got rooms you know
1	mm
1	where you re living you ve got a bedroom to yourself if you put it down as anon nametype m type name then
1	well he s he said he he
1	he would
1	he could yeah he would do that but that would mean erm that it would show up that he s he s getting an unearned income or something like that you know er and that and that that would
1	well only only
1	that would actually affect and also it would affect his rates because
1	yeah
1	that would be more than one person living in the house
1	yeah
1	and he said you can do that anon nametype m type name but you ll have to pay the difference in rates
1	yeah yeah which isn t a huge amount though
1	well i ll have to find out when i see him
1	erm it s erm it s what they call erm community tax tomato sauce
1	please yeah since you told me the benefits of
1	tomato sauce absolutely i mean i don t eat it myself i can t stand it but everyone tells me it s do you want a cup of tea
1	lovely
1	camomile
1	er peppermint please
1	peppermint okay pause dur short yeah so trunc th trunc this is the thing so if you put it down here we re not overcrowded we ve got rooms if you put it down at anon nametype m type name s then it ll show that you re you know haven t got a bedroom of your own and you are overcrowded but if you it might trunc compli trunc you don t have to say you re paying him any rent
1	mm
1	so it won t affect his income
1	no but it will affect his rates
1	yeah it would affect his er his erm community tax the only thing is of course he s got his nephew staying there and he might not want that to be
1	well technically his his his property is four to six actually
1	mm right oh right
1	and where his nephew s staying there s a door that leads into the
1	other room
1	the other room where his bedroom is
1	right
1	he s got a bedroom and that is technically number four
1	right
1	and anon nametype m type name is number six
1	right okay pause dur short what anon nametype m type name needs to do is get the other ones up and running
1	mm well
1	and you pay rent and get housing benefit that would be the thing that would be the ideal
1	he showed me his new new year s resolutions for two thousand and thirteen
1	oh major new year s resolutions
1	yeah for two thousand and thirteen
1	oh for two thousand and thirteen
1	and that erm one of them is to erm do his property up at least
1	yeah
1	one day a week
1	oh that s good
1	and that i think it s going to be on his list of trunc th trunc things to do
1	unclear
1	and i told him yeah i told him i ll be you know more than happy to help out
1	yeah give you something to occupy yourself
1	mm
1	and actually probably be very good for you because using physical energy makes you tired and sleep well
1	mm well in theory vocal desc laugh i thought that that would be the case erm the day before yesterday
1	yesterday
1	no it was on sunday
1	oh yeah
1	you know when we did did all that walking
1	yeah
1	didn t do much unclear but
1	yeah
1	walking around anon type place along the seafront and er
1	well unclear
1	well when the time time to go to bed i still didn t have my pills with me right
1	right
1	so i wasn t sure how that would affect me but i kept you know thinking and things go around in your head you know
1	mm
1	about the past and the future and
1	so you ve got to leave the past behind
1	and i unclear
1	really anon nametype m type name and think of the future
1	i know well apparently you should live in the now live in the present
1	yeah
1	mm
1	mm well yeah
1	well
1	i agree with that
1	but erm
1	because i also
1	er you know it s it s the mind that keeps grabbing you back
1	mm
1	you know mine loves problems and it presents you with all the problems that it s going to think about
1	well especially at night
1	mm
1	i often anything i anything on my mind worries me at night
1	but also they
1	but in the morning i come up with a solution often
1	sure
1	i go oh that s it you know that s what i ll do or that s unclear
1	but essentially you know for my particular problem there is no solution really er
1	well there are solutions
1	well yeah
1	they re not they re not in you know not maybe ideal solutions but there are solutions and
1	mm
1	you know and it s erm
1	but also he s got this grandfather clock
1	anon nametype m type name has
1	yeah well he s got two actually he s got one on the landing on the on the stairs leading up and another in the living room and it s so loud
1	ah ticking
1	and yeah and two o clock in the morning and i was still
1	tearing your hair out
1	not asleep but i got up and stopped the pendulum
1	did you
1	mm well it was still you know but i i i couldn t get back to sleep and i turned the tv on and watched erm a programme about autopsies called
1	lovely
1	erm michael jackson how
1	oh really
1	you know the reason yeah the reason why he died
1	oh
1	another programme about john denver and
1	i ll give you that back anon nametype m type name
1	oh in the end well no
1	unclear it s floating around and it s getting tomato sauce
1	well put it in your bag it s yours
1	i told you it s fine keep it
1	so i don t know eventually i must have dropped off about four or five or something
1	yeah
1	i got a couple of hours sleep and er
1	so do you think the tablets that you re taking they do help
1	i think they do
1	yeah
1	well so last night i went to because i had slept so little the night before
1	mm
1	around ten o clock i just couldn t keep my eyes open
1	well that s good though
1	well it was except i woke up at midnight and then
1	oh no
1	well i trunc we trunc went back to sleep again but then i then i woke up again at four o clock and and that was it
1	oh
1	so i was awake at four this morning
1	oh that s no good well i wonder why though i mean do you think your body clock s still
1	no
1	no
1	no
1	it does take a long time to adjust you know and you just think it s sleepless nights and stressing
1	mm
1	insomnia they call it don t they if you can t sleep
1	yeah i was renowned in my trunc young trunc younger days erm for
1	leave that there
1	for er sleeping
1	for sleeping
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh and now you re renowned for waking
1	and i could sleep anywhere any time unclear but it s getting into regular you know
1	a routine
1	have a routine
1	yeah that s one of the things though when you when you erm can t sleep at night you don t want to get up in the morning but if you get up in the morning at least you re tired at night you know what i mean you might yawn a lot during the day but i i know that unless i keep my routine well i wouldn t sleep i i m awake later at night now than i ever used to when i was working mm
1	mm
1	yeah and that dell computer that s what keeps me awake on the computer my laptop and and they say the blue light from emitted from er screens is erm prevents sleep
1	really
1	yeah so they say you shouldn t watch tv which i do and you shouldn t use a laptop or or erm tablet because or even a phone because they emit a blue light which affects your sleep and i don t know i don t know whether that s true but not that i ever have trouble sleeping except if i ve got an inspection at college unclear vocal desc laugh then i can t sleep probably but erm it s a shame sleep is so important to your you know your health and wellbeing but
1	yeah it s
1	you ve got to well get back in a routine maybe what you know what you re doing get up and go out for a walk is very good a brisk walk
1	mm
1	something like that get a pair of roller skates on
1	well i ve done my exercise for the day
1	vocal desc laugh you what
1	i ve done a bit of exercise today
1	mm did you walk from anon type place then to or did you catch the bus

1	well i got the bus to erm the pavilion
1	mm

1	what
1	she s registered with the british government
1	with the yeah yeah so you ve got all that that s you know erm pause dur short then i suppose you you need to write a list of things you want to talk to them about
1	it s funny you should say that anon nametype m type name said exactly the same thing vocal desc laugh and i said i know what i ve got to talk about
1	yeah but it s so easy to forget when you re talking about like some one thing you go off on one direction
1	yeah
1	if you ve got them on a list you can say oh yeah
1	yeah you re probably right
1	i just wanted to ask about this so trunc i trunc it s worth doing
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short well one of them of course that you haven t thought about perhaps isn t er er wasn t on your mind is child benefit
1	yes
1	say i ve got to contribute to her
1	well i have actually
1	yeah yeah of course i know you have
1	you know i i agreed to pay the school fees
1	mm
1	so
1	which is more than you actually get coming in at the moment
1	maybe yeah
1	don t don t tell them that you re she s in a private school or anything
1	well
1	she s
1	unclear
1	just say you have to pay for school over there
1	yeah
1	schooling it s not free erm so and which of the unclear about the property or anything because that would complicate things but
1	well it wouldn t make any difference it s not er there s only one of them is in my joint name
1	mm
1	but
1	mm but they ll be looking at that
1	yeah but i i
1	trunc in trunc as income income from that
1	well fair enough yeah
1	what you could say is that she s living in it
1	yeah pause dur short
1	has has it trunc g trunc has it got a mortgage or anything like that do they have mortgages like we do
1	we did actually well after we bought the first one we got a a a loan
1	mm
1	i suppose you could call it a mortgage but er for because we didn t have quite enough to buy it and it s it s weird you can the erm the chinese they they ve got a can do attitude to everything you know
1	mm mm
1	and there s no way they re gonna give me a loan
1	no
1	but trunc a trunc and again you know anon nametype f type name didn t have a job but so they created a job for her they made her manageress of mcdonald s
1	vocal desc laugh really
1	yeah
1	how weird
1	so they yeah so that we could get the loan
1	good grief how weird is that because she s not trunc eli trunc because you re not eligible to have a loan
1	i i wasn t eligible and er
1	yeah we can give you a loan
1	and and she wasn t working so she suddenly became employed
1	mm and so no paperwork or no nothing for it
1	no
1	it was just
1	just to
1	put it on a paper bit of paper
1	yes just
1	fill in the form tell a little lie and you can have what you want what would happen if if the loan hadn t been repaid then what do they do about that
1	well they repossess the property
1	yeah i suppose so yes so it wasn t a loan against the the property then rather than just a personal loan
1	well it must have been they wouldn t have taken a chance of
1	mm
1	of doing that but the the chinese are trying to cut down on the amount the banks are giving cos all the banks are underwritten by the government
1	cut down on the amount of
1	money they re lending
1	oh right yeah yeah mm they re all under well it s a bit like here ours are aren t they really
1	well yeah

0	then they unfollowed you
0	right
0	like some girl from anon type place actually has quite a few hundred followers like pause dur short now each have started following me she was like a third year or something and i started following her because i was like oh anon type place
0	mm pause dur short but then once i followed her back i re fronted my page and i d gone down to like a hundred and eighty followers and i was like you fucking bitch sorry i trunc apol trunc vocal desc laugh
0	so is that what they do then they follow you so you follow them back and then they unfollow you
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah
0	event desc unintelligible and erm so i started doing that and that s what i see is that when the person is private i don t bother adding them cos i don t know what their photos are like i don t know if i m gonna enjoy following them
0	yeah
0	yeah like anon nametype f type name erm pause dur short thanks pause dur short thank you she s got mm pause dur short two thousand and something followers
0	mm
0	if like having people
0	yeah
0	it s creepy
0	exactly so she s almost hit that point where her videos she s gonna be paid to do them
0	really
0	promote our product
0	yeah
0	mm
0	like i really really love that and that s why i wanted to start doing videos but for my music cos like i ve wanted to do that for a while i ve been too shy
0	i know it s
0	no i no i understand trunc th trunc
0	mm
0	make you a dickhead it s not attractive but the fact that you don t know it and the fact that you re so insecure receiving compliments makes it more clear that you are a beautiful person
0	like so anyway let s just forget i said that because i don t want you to feel awkward
0	yeah
0	why
0	i see a lot of myself in you pause dur short but mostly i see a lot of my personality in you but it s parts of my parts of my personality that i would never show
0	i think that s what drew me to you at first is because i d love to be outgoing and i m really outgoing with the people that know me pause dur short but with strangers i m not like when you were so outgoing with strangers and so came to my door and so easily made friends so this is the kind of person i need to be with because you ll you bring out like the better side of me
0	if you know what i mean pause dur short whereas if i was to hang out with another shy person it would be awkward like erm anon nametype n type name s friend anon nametype n type name pause dur short i had a absolutely fantastic night when i went out with them that was the first night i went out with anon nametype f type name black anon nametype f type name
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i said that because i knew i was gonna live with you
0	and because you didn t know then yet wasn t gonna be like okay but anon nametype f type name has to come cos they didn t know you
0	mm
0	so i just like yeah thanks i m previously engaged vocal desc laugh
0	l actually broached the awkwardness and i was like
0	like me with anon nametype f type name
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and then the whole night it was amazing because i didn t know anon nametype f type name very well at that point this was still very early this was in like first semester
0	the thing is with anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name has a lot of friends and she only considers a small group of them close
0	yeah
0	oh it s because i went to erm i left that day remember i left down to london that day
0	yeah
0	so cos it s like i know i m the same it s like i made you as a friend and anon nametype f type name and i felt like that was enough for me like i i feel more comfortable
0	mm
0	in smaller numbers and when you started branching out i was like i was so happy for you i was like i m so happy that you ve gotten over that insecurity because of everything that happened with our flatmates
0	mm
0	that s so so sweet
0	it makes me feel really good because i ve always gotten on really well with black anon nametype f type name
0	yeah like from that first night when we bonded over unclear betty crocker unclear and the fact that she got naked in front of me
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	i just find it hard to not feel awkward around her pause dur short but that s the same as anon nametype f type name i trunc fee trunc i will always feel like awkward around anon nametype f type name even though after our library sessions and all our like anon nametype f type name were one of the first people i told all that happened with them and they were calling me a slag and all that even after that i still feel awkward around them but that s cos i ve not spent enough time with them not to feel awkward
0	whereas mine s different i ve got so close to anon nametype f type name straight away
0	like i ve never gotten
0	no me neither
0	anon nametype f type name raves on about anon nametype f type name but she said as trunc soo trunc as soon as she started seeing anon nametype m type name she changed and maybe that s why you don t get that vibe from her because i don t get
0	a nice vibe from her either
0	yeah
0	so i went with them and it was a really really fun night like we sat in anon type place for a few drinks and were like out clubbing but erm pause dur short like i met them we met up with white anon nametype f type name like pure coincidence she was walking around with her boyfriend and anon nametype f type name saw her outside when we went out for a cigarette and anon nametype f type name scrounged a cigarette off me even though when i m completely sober i would never let anon nametype f type name smoke
0	as soon as she s drunk and i m drunk and i m smoking she s like can i have a bit and i m like yeah go on smoke it like
0	and i feel trunc s trunc so bad about that
0	yeah but she doesn t smoke normally
0	go on i ll have a drag
0	white anon nametype f type name and her boyfriend came round and we re like we were having a laugh and a drink and a joke and then they got into an argument and they went home and anon nametype f type name was like no i don t wanna come out with you guys i m gonna go home so we were like okay we went out but that was the only time i properly bonded with her like we had one on one conversations
0	yeah
0	i was chatting to anon nametype f type name it was fine and the next few times like the time that we went out for pre drinks and i don t know if you remember i went down a bit earlier than you
0	but i need someone to make the first move so anon nametype f type name was bezzy mates with her i m already a little bit awkward with anon nametype f type name but just because we ve never had the bonding experience so like it was fine but then anon nametype f type name came down with her boyfriend and i was chatting to them and we were playing never have i ever and me and her boyfriend drank at the same thing i can t remember what it was it was something funny and he was like oh you too and we started laughing and i could just see her sort of like eyeing me a bit weird
0	anon nametype f type name
0	yeah but because i knew he was i knew that he was her boyfriend so like vocal desc sigh it sounds really stupid but as soon as i saw her eyeing me i was purposefully brushing off any conversation he made with me and he was standing next to me and he kept making conversation and i was just like yeah and i was trying to be purposefully a bit shut off so that she would see that i wasn t
0	but it s it it turned out fine and then cos anon nametype m type name was there a really good friend of
0	yeah erm asian asian anon nametype m type name
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah so it was me and anon nametype f type name and him and anon nametype m type name and then we became like a kind of foursome
0	right
0	unclear
0	yeah
0	and i was like oh but anon nametype m type name i loved you
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i disappear all the time like how many times do i disappear
0	over the course of the year just the
0	oh god i literally
0	she s completely right and everyone was like no she was the one that left we tried looking for her we couldn t find her
0	yeah
0	no to be fair i think it were like trunc par trunc fifty fifty blame cos like i managed to get us into the vip area but i can t remember how we got in vocal desc laugh so i was like
0	yeah we and we walked
0	and there was a walk to go up so we went up
0	you blagged us in but
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i know
0	you went with everyone i was on my own
0	we waited upstairs for about half an hour
0	but you went off to see someone you didn t come back we waited there for half an hour and we were like right we need to start looking for her so we some of us stayed upstairs me and anon nametype f type name and anon nametype n type name and cos anon nametype f type name was there as well we went downstairs everyone else stayed upstairs
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but instead of being angry i got upset
0	oh i m sorry
0	because that time because i was no no i m not saying this to make you upset it s just i m telling you my side because
0	mm
0	we were so close i literally i felt so guilty like i couldn t enjoy myself without you being there
0	i was like oh my god i feel so bad but the next day you were completely fine with me the next day when you
0	like
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and i came over and it was fine and you were like hi how are you and stuff and i was like pause dur short you don t know
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and that s when you were like no no i m sorry it was my fault and you said all this kind of stuff and i was like i have been worried
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	i m such a dick i m sorry vocal desc laugh
0	no but from now
0	wouldn t say yeah aggressive when you re drunk
0	i ve stopped taking it personal personally
0	you re just gonna leave me
0	er i m i m just gonna leave you
0	because i m not saying this nasty like obviously i ll check that you were okay and like ring you if you stop answering or whatever if you ve gone home to sleep i m just gonna like she s fucking fine
0	because that night was honestly i i was sick with worry
0	oh i m so sorry
0	i m so sorry
0	not even or a bit more
0	we were still like even then we were like mega close though weren t we like
0	yeah
0	so
0	even when i
0	everyone
0	and honestly it s not a a problem but i felt like i had to agree with you on everything because you were so strong personality wise
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	she s gonna yell at me tomorrow and all that kind of stuff
0	but he was like you re out with all these people and i was like yes but i don t like them
0	vocal desc laugh so that s why at first i was so scared because i felt like i had to agree with like all of your opinions
0	mm
0	like i i have to agree with her because otherwise we won t be friends
0	all the nights i ve been like don t take offence don t take offence
0	mm
0	mm
0	i i can t like i physically can t
0	and trunc y trunc and the thing is you ve taught me that like
0	it s like i just don t care i nothing them
0	with their feelings i guess
0	so because i was also quite young i mean i was only eighteen like i m nineteen now it s not a big difference but because i d never pause dur short lived through all the stuff that
0	didn t i didn t speak to her for four years i used to tell her how much i hated her
0	that s really sad though that s really
0	it s alight event desc unintelligible
0	it was weird i don t know why event desc unintelligible pause dur long
0	the thing is anon nametype f type name though
0	and
0	and you still are but
0	i m working on it
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	you are not like that
0	i ve always always felt every time something happened and i er i couldn t not that you were insinuating because i know you didn t mean it to put me down but when you d say or when anon nametype m type name actually would say i hope like people would stick up or whatever it s when i realised i was like i i need to i need to stick up cos i was like i i love her so much and i can t even stick up for my friend who is in need of it and that s when i really realised that there was a problem and i tried to make a difference like that
0	and you did though
0	but
0	you didn t stand up with your gob you stood up by being my friend
0	and you stood up in a different way
0	and everything was so perfect like you remember that little white board that we had
0	put all our names on it
0	mm
0	and i was like things could be better thanks like i was being short and i was
0	but like in my head
0	hear me out like this isn t nasty at all you re saying this now but at the time i know you wanted to stick up for me i could see it in your eyes i could sense it in what you were saying even anon nametype m type name i think the worst part was anon nametype m type name because he was the one that made me feel the worst i can t remember exactly what it was that he said or what would be said but he would make it known that he was disappointed in the fact that i wasn t pause dur short sticking up do you know what i mean
0	mm
0	because of what they ve done to someone else because no matter how close that person is to me or whatever i if unless they hurt me personally i physically can t muster that strength and that anger
0	i know you do
0	er anon nametype f type name
0	i can t
0	no
0	i m sorry because i realise that
0	it s not because of you
0	but i would always choose you over anyone else
0	yeah but i
0	well of course
0	through you helping me and showing me that it s okay to stick up for yourself and it s okay to get angry at people it s not the end of the world pause dur short because i i guess that from where i came from it s it was it was quite an enclosed environment like with my parents and my friends pause dur long
0	and it was fine and as soon as i realised and i saw anon nametype f type name s reaction yes she was hurt but talked through it and then we went out together and it was fine like it was absolutely fine there was
0	yeah you worked it out
0	not even an awkwardness because she wanted to hear it and i was ready to say it it made me realise that i ve got nothing to be afraid of by standing up for myself and that s because of you pause dur short so i want you to know that if anything happens if ever i run into any of those girls or if ever they say something to me i ll be ready to say something back and if ever you have any problem with anyone else i m i m ready to stick up for you it s like
0	but
0	rather than immediately defending myself what i do is i i mull it over it builds deep inside of me and then one day i snap
0	and it builds up
0	i inverted it on myself
0	i m sorry for doing that to you
0	i shouldn t have put you in that even though you are
0	you are my closest friend
0	i was so ashamed at it and the fact that it was happening and i was so ashamed that i d gone back to that after having it happen before i was so ashamed at myself that i felt like the only way i could genuinely get it out was if i was drunk and i wouldn t have any inhibitions or anything but genuinely you are my closest closest friend and i would tell you anything pause dur short but i felt bad at the way that i did it because i felt like i owed you more than telling you my deepest darkest secret when i was drunk i felt like i owed it to you to tell you when i was sober
0	it
0	i m so glad that
0	i ve calmed down and i haven t been stressed and i haven t had worries or since i saw my sister and it s been fine pause dur short but like honestly i think it s just cos i ve been away from him like the only person whose opinion of myself and my body matters because like it does get away with yourself like when you were saying when we go to the gym and we see those really skinny girls always doing stuff
0	no i know you say that but people have different visions of their own bodies
0	like my weight
0	bothers me so much
0	shut up
0	and i can t
0	no anon nametype f type name
0	i can t even
0	no
0	i don t compare myself to you i compare myself to fucking ridiculous things like celebrities and
0	they are perfect in comparison to your body and your boobs and your waist goes in so much and you have perfect curves in an arse it s like it s like looking at iggy azalea
0	but you have the tits that go with it
0	and it s so irritating because
0	but a bum as well because i know that i m petite but i m a kind of curvy petite
0	most petite people s i i think of petite and i think of anon nametype f type name small boobs small body
0	you ve not got small boobs
0	i m alright but i ve got the curves that go with it but not the kind of arse that goes with it
0	and i feel the same when you vocal desc laugh fucking say the same shit
0	that s fine and then you turn around and look at me and i m like yeah yeah i agree i m just like what s she talking about
0	i need you to stop
0	i need you to stop
0	i need you to stop
0	she were on bebo vocal desc laugh
0	oh bitch
0	mm
0	everyone thinks i m confident until i m a friend
0	but i think one of the reasons is that i ve always been pretty confident in myself like i have always just like not cared well i say that apart from a few hiccups along the way i ve always just sort of not cared and i ve been like this is who i am and no matter how much i diet and no matter how much i do sport my body just never changes pause dur short so like whatever but then when i came to leeds and like i found you and like how confident you were and anon nametype f type name how confident she is and stuff it just sort of made me think about little things that i d never thought about before it just makes everything go into like overdrive which i m sure is what s happened with you as well like you just look at other people and just
0	fake it until you make it
0	like you fake like anon nametype m type name you d think he d be the most confident guy in the world he is the most insecure person i ve ever met other than myself
0	the same i would never ever think that about him
0	but how confident does he come across
0	mm
0	i ve heard that
0	and fucking cheesy
0	go like that and winking
0	cos he s not manly enough vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh neither is anon nametype m type name his beard grows here
0	she said that to me as well
0	i would never say that to her
0	we should like go to the
0	i was going to say yeah pause dur short em i ll take you now to kind of one of the not very nice bits
0	can we hire a car to do it
0	this
0	it s good pause dur short we could have gone to see anon nametype m type name again today but i think that would have been pushing it
0	i love that the eh the eh unclear have got a jacket tied on to a unclear thing poking out saying yeah pause dur short that doesn t make it safe
0	em em
0	yeah yeah
0	no to fit in

0	or something to do with a hundred not a thousand
0	yeah
0	yeah that s good that s sorted pause dur short now i m just thinking the way to the meet pause dur short it was relevant to something
0	well i will actually need to remember that i need to start taking them with me
0	yeah yeah pause dur short it s not a bad idea anyway cos i guess even in winter you can have bright sun
0	do you want me to have a look so you know where it is
0	yeah i don t think they re going to let you miss that one
0	i hope not anyway
0	so em do you want to give anon nametype m type name a a bell and make some plans for him and tell him to bring anon nametype m type name s stuff if he wants to
0	i think i would like to get some unclear today pause dur short it s just kind of a fun way of unclear and i d like at least us to go
0	okay well i maybe pause dur short cos
0	what
0	i m trying to think what em pause dur short i can t remember what time the last bus is
0	oh right yeah pause dur short em pause dur short i m sure he said something else pause dur short i can t remember why he got up so early pause dur short it s like yesterday morning
0	barely unclear
0	yeah it just seems like a kind of slightly odd yeah use of eh
0	unclear interesting choice of phrase pause dur short unclear tangible benefits
0	unclear
0	yeah pause dur short it s a good situation to be in
0	em pause dur short no i don t think so i mean i think it was completely clear
0	oh right okay pause dur short sounds quite that s better for him then
0	yeah it ll be nice actually i m really looking forward to it
0	an os map if we can unclear so i might ask dan if he s got one pause dur short i don t think we ve got one
0	alright just if there s no wind
0	how the hell did that come up
0	that was quite a bizarre night but quite fun
0	it sounded pretty awful
0	yeah it did actually yeah pause dur short in unclear finding out the well kind of finding out the solution to sherlock pause dur short i m not sure we really did
0	don t you think
0	but yeah em it was funny this morning we were like i didn t realise she had such a deep kind of throaty laugh and i was like don t mention the fags pause dur short oh pause dur short i did have an image of her accidentally leaving them on the on the table and eh my parents being like anon nametype f type name are these yours
0	your parents would actually ask you that question
0	no no no they wouldn t but i was a bit like
0	cool pause dur short cos that i mean yeah pause dur short he could come earlier and come to the gym with us pause dur short or if he comes at half six we ll probably have been to the gym anyway pause dur short so we will pause dur short that could fit in fine i think
0	okay cool
0	i m also possibly thinking unclear is one of unclear
0	okay
0	this isn t best way of servicing the unclear
0	beach boys
0	abba that would fun pause dur short let s try that
0	unclear
0	and not dancing queen
0	roseberry topping yeah
0	i think we found her for a tenner in hmv the other day
0	well that s fine
0	it s fine but i think look on amazon because
0	it s cheap for two box sets like that
0	but yeah but i think it s worth looking on amazon because they might just have it reduced i think they re more likely to have it reduced and it s not you know not any different from getting it from town
0	i d like it urgently
0	okay pause dur short imagine if we got it for you know eight ninety nine it might be worth
0	but it won t pause dur short there s no way it ll be on for that
0	okay well we ll have a look pause dur short it s kind of weird i mean i m kind of wondering what the last series is going to be like pause dur short whether it s going to be just a bit sad you know cos they re all a bit older and pause dur short or whether it s going to stay being good pause dur short cos it hasn t really got worse quality i don t think
0	no
0	i think it even improves with age because the relationships develop
0	oh right
0	sweet
0	this guy is unclear cos he s managing sixty quite comfortably
0	yeah not bad pause dur short how is the unclear
0	right yeah yeah pause dur short put it on the board
0	it doesn t have to be particularly nice you know pause dur short em pause dur short yeah that would work unclear it is a good vacuum for doing that with actually
0	exactly yeah pause dur short the thing is like you know hoover bags bin bags is they re really expensive pause dur short especially if you ve got a fancy hoover and you need to get the branded hoover bags pause dur short and you unclear you need to get the ones that fit
0	yeah it was wasn t it
0	yeah but we do all like the cars our father have driven pause dur short i think it s really interesting pause dur short em but yes ha ha very amusing pause dur short it does look better with the unclear you re right pause dur short ah frank s factory flooring pause dur short unclear used to be em so frank s flooring store pause dur short used to be frank s factory flooring and then they changed it cos it sounded a bit cheap and knock off pause dur short but the tag line is i love carpet s me pause dur short so there s these radio adverts pause dur short franks factory flooring pause dur short i love carpet s me pause dur short it s excellent
0	and my other favourite is hadglider unclear had a bric a brac random kid of electrical type shop but you know a kind of second hand store pause dur short and the tag line was up for sale give us a bell pause dur short which was excellent pause dur short what was the other weird one that my dad always talks about when em pause dur short cos it was for some kind of tailor pause dur short em when he s talking you know kind of saying you know we em pause dur short you know an indian man you know doing the voice over saying em tailors we do em unclear everything pause dur short unclear bikini and anorak pause dur short vocal desc laugh it s just bizarre pause dur short ha pause dur short a list of items they can put unclear
0	yeah exactly yeah pause dur short it s time to be cautious pause dur short don t want to end up in a thai prison pause dur short oh good that s finished
0	yeah that d be fun
0	that looks like a dog
0	unclear
0	i imagine the hills would be accessible pause dur short unclear hills pause dur short that is easy access
0	shift new singing unclear shift new normal the tangerine
0	and the other chap i just can t think who he is
0	he is actually getting really famous pause dur short em he s in
0	no no well he was in pirates i think pause dur short yeah he s in pirates but not in unclear and he s in em the new unclear
0	that looked really good pause dur short was that subtitled or i can t remember
0	yeah well unclear i didn t actually watch it i was
0	well we ve got it recorded but unfortunately not in any way that would eh provide evidence pause dur short ah it s the lorries again doing their thing pause dur short it s so annoying
0	this other guy behind him wasn t going to give him lots of room so pause dur short he s sticking right up behind him
0	yeah they pause dur short yeah pause dur short well the gap now turns into ten yards
0	alright pause dur short stop
0	you re either on you re not pause dur short unless you are you re unclear by the traffic acts pause dur short which does actually apply to you unless you re training or responding to an emergency
0	unclear
0	yeah there is actually nice little cycle lane down here
0	yeah pause dur short fair enough i guess
0	we re getting to the unclear of james harriet pause dur short yey
0	yeah so em we need to go on pause dur short it s so it s like coming off again we we the a doesn t actually go directly into the a m but em pause dur short we go on to the a and i imagine it will be signposted
0	yeah pause dur short oh sorry yeah yeah we stay on pause dur short yeah no you re right the a comes off at a junction pause dur short we are close enough to unclear it s that first pause dur short yeah we sit stay on this road pause dur short em pause dur short and then that feeds into the a m so yeah it should be nice and straight forward pause dur short yeah like i said i think there will be services further north than anon type place itself pause dur short em so
0	likely i should think
0	i ve got unclear on here pause dur short a specialised tourist attraction for somebody in the country
0	yeah it s on the unclear yeah
0	oh
0	underestimating his appeal pause dur short i just don t think he has massive appeal pause dur short yes so we stay on this road now this is where the a comes off we em we don t want to carry on pause dur short i think it carries on down to york
0	that s trunc ri trunc that s good
0	oh right
0	so yeah sorry yeah so i should explain pause dur short em it s not it s just coxwold priory house or whatever the priory and coxwold vicarage pause dur short and it i don t think it had any particular interesting name but they called the house in tristram shandy is called shandy hall and they ve named it in honour of laurence sterne
0	because it was unclear autobiographical
0	it was semi autobiographical
0	right pause dur short and unclear is a vicar yeah
0	very nice
0	interesting just to unclear to yorkshire and unclear about
0	yeah files miles to the unclear unclear
0	get a what sorry
0	ah
0	by memorising this leaflet
0	do they fine
0	i think they said they would pause dur short they wanted to see how it ended
0	great
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short nice and easy pause dur short it s very straight forward pause dur short you get onto the a and just sit on the road pause dur short like there isn t anything to do
0	ah pause dur short well pause dur short yeah all one motorway
0	that was unfortunate pause dur short i accidentally pressed too many keys when i was typing in pop and it came trunc o trunc came out as porn
0	that s easier than going up and then coming off the unclear yeah
0	at busford there with the unclear
0	yeah yeah pause dur short true pause dur short well that s the way my dad always go pause dur short but i think it is yeah it s very civilised pause dur short and you get to do the cool unclear bit pause dur short so is this the em anon type place services in forty miles
0	yes now but yes in terms of its unclear so that s unclear
0	true but it would be hard to beat anon nametype m type name
0	say we re just both thinking about you and
0	yeah
0	awesome pause dur short i m hoping that s been nice just to to be remembered is sometimes nice if you re away from people pause dur short it s easier to forget if you if someone s not around you so pause dur short i hope it s nice to be reminded that people are you know rooting for her pause dur short yeah em so pause dur short i just think it s interesting what s happened with anon nametype m type name that he s you know he always seems quite em you know really into the theatre thing and more career focused than kind of plays or relationships or whatever and pause dur short you know more i could have imagined him doing that pause dur short taking it quite seriously and willing to give up a lot for it but actually
0	he s decided not to
0	well they tend to have that effect
0	i was very dubious but he said it should be done pause dur short i think anon nametype m type name s got a beard pause dur short i can see that happening pause dur short as in my cousin anon nametype m type name
0	yeah pause dur short what s anon nametype m type name s boyfriend called again
0	anon nametype m type name yeah
0	well i suppose they re people of his own generation
0	well yeah pause dur short well no i mean but the fact he s now living with another boyfriend unclear his parents pause dur short i just wonder if they re a little bit
0	what anon nametype m type name wants to do sorry
0	yes
0	mm pause dur short excuse me
0	no i meant close to us or not
0	there s all the thing pause dur short unclear
0	lovely spot for a picnic
0	maybe not entirely pause dur short but to fair we could probably just take these inside and eat them there but eh
0	mine s ham hock and extra mature cheddar cheese on multi seed farmhouse brown bread
0	ah yeah pause dur short i know you like it mature
0	as toast
0	of course cos you ve had them before cos i ve brought some on holiday once
0	mm pause dur short it s funny but given it was your family that introduced me to wraps how your parents are eating them with knives and forks
0	mm pause dur short this is pretty good actually pause dur short m and s quality
0	mm pause dur short well these taste the difference one s are nice pause dur short and they re not pause dur short because they re part of the deal
0	well exactly pause dur short i think most of them probably chocolate and crisps pause dur short vocal desc cough really need to stop inhaling the bread
0	yeah pause dur short i wasn t that keen on her lighting the fag on the hob pause dur short i was like my there s been too much gas
0	on television
0	ah right pause dur short that does make sense
0	oh there s a spaniel out the unclear gorgeous but he s quite frisky pause dur short as you might understand having been shoved in a car for a while
0	grape eh
0	yeah
0	cued
0	mm
0	in principle yeah in practice no pause dur short it s okay for a while but you do need someone to look after it pause dur short it s not really fair to leave it at home all day when you re at work i don t think pause dur short unless you ve got two
0	cos dogs keep each other company kind of well enough
0	well the spaniels are sort of neither here nor there pause dur short and collies are fairly sort of people dogs
0	yeah pause dur short i m just having an image of those blue napkins i was presented with the first time i went on holiday with your family
0	yeah it s much more fun on a phd
0	yes
0	mm pause dur short interesting
0	hmm
0	mm
0	mm
0	er it s not pause dur short or as in it wasn t pause dur short it wasn t out and out luxurious
0	in the same way that sort of maybe newer and swisher ones are so we re gonna have our own pause dur short i think they ve now pretty much all got flatscreen tvs pause dur short they don t have their our own hot tubs
0	erm they certainly er you know used to be er very good taste
0	yeah
0	erm
0	okay pause dur short erm so i mean yeah pros and cons i guess pause dur short i guess er nice cottage you know pause dur short erm pause dur short i mean i think the the main thing is it s not worth obviously we re not gonna go if they won t give us it for
0	we could of course just have it for a week
0	yeah i mean we could try and ask them and see if we can get it
0	have the entirety of a week off
0	still driving and fuel conserving petrol
0	er it would be three to four days
0	unclear you need to have four days off pause dur short erm
0	oh deer
0	i though it was a fox to start with
0	i did see what you did there pause dur short very good
0	you started off
0	yeah i mean if it is pause dur short it s not necessarily that much further driving wise but if feels like it like mentally pause dur short cos i ve got so used to doing that drive up north
0	it would be a complete change
0	yeah pause dur short we could just chill out pause dur short do the things we want to pause dur short there s no pressure to go anywhere or see anyone pause dur short we don t know anyone in anon type place you know pause dur short erm
0	yeah
0	cos there are no speed cameras and therefore i m just gonna allow the car to bring itself down to speed pause dur long i wouldn t normally do it but it s very clear
0	ah pause dur short fabulous cos anon type place you really can t do that
0	you can pause dur short it s just not easy
0	yeah pause dur short oh that d be nice yeah pause dur short wander down the pub and then come back and have some dinner
0	either of the other two
0	either of the other two might be nice pause dur short which gives it a bit trunc mo trunc you know gives us a little more hope that neither of them will go pause dur short or one er sorry one of them will be available
0	yeah they re both the same price which is a very sensible pricing structure
0	they probably will do i mean unfortunately it s no longer anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name cos they d definitely have done it
0	mm yeah
0	erm
0	so if you yeah so if you say i know anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name that will help pause dur short ha
0	pause dur long
0	yeah didn t have to stop
0	you re in the peak of efficiency tonight
0	i m trying
0	what we should do on sunday pause dur short oh sorry on friday night is go to a college bar
0	i m not working out tomorrow
0	er yeah trunc if trunc i would
0	alright
0	yeah pause dur short i haven t actually had to stop once since entering anon type place
0	the lights
0	just easing off here pause dur short just take second pause dur short i need a bit more flexibility pause dur short it s not that bad there
0	yeah
0	ironically sitting up with your engine idle in that queue you d probably be more cost effective to drive to
0	well maybe not by the time you ve driven there but
0	it s quite a big lorry actually
0	okay
0	yeah pause dur short none of you lot are very decisive
0	um pause dur short i mean anon type place is a nice option
0	where else
0	alimentum pause dur short erm
0	yes
0	i m not particularly fussed on going to anon type place in some ways
0	hmm hmm hmm pause dur short oh
0	hmm hm pause dur short oh first time we ve had to stop
0	which bus
0	the uni four pause dur short the one that we get erm
0	erm i think it s called that because it goes between erm kind of comes down from anon type place sort of end and goes to anon type place and anon type place pause dur short there s a lot of students at anon type place
0	ah
0	and then through to anon type place which which i used to do for my supervisions pause dur short anon type place to anon type place direct bus pause dur short trunc oof trunc pause dur short girls out on the town look at that
0	oh
0	i ve seen actually it s not that bad i ve seen a lot worse
0	the skirts are all exactly the same length
0	what if it is a uniform it s called fashion
0	that s anon type place s road sixth form pause dur short erm anon type place is a little bit further on pause dur short very very good sixth form that one
0	um yes pause dur short that s er no that s education pause dur short oh no it is anon type place pause dur short that s the education building pause dur short this bit here is sort of anon type place main building
0	are they taught there
0	yeah pause dur short trunc do trunc well the the education does well i think drama you would be in the english faculty for some of it
0	and this is a degree from the university of anon type place
0	well no i mean like so education i think you have to do with a subject obviously pause dur short and so anon nametype f type name did maths for half of her time and education for half of her time
0	no i meant the education and drama
0	i don t know i you think you pause dur short well i m not sure because there definitely is the i did i was supervised because i did shakespeare in performance and i was a supervised with drama students
0	so my other leg s aching now
0	mm
0	so trunc bus trunc
0	here presumably
0	there s a barrier but i ll see what it says
0	ah right pause dur short staff one
0	patient
0	which way
0	so right
0	so so the next left
0	so back the way we ve come from
0	back yeah yeah sorry yeah
0	that s what i mean pause dur short right pause dur short when i m on a roundabout it doesn t mean nothing
0	main hospital car park yeah
0	ah multi story pause dur short wow
0	oh my god
0	one assumes so yeah
0	oh my god pause dur short ha ha pause dur short it s only until seven charged pause dur short thank goodness

0	yeah pause dur short it did also say apologies this is a cash only car park
0	ha ha pause dur short well yeah it wasn t a service space pause dur short excellent
0	just one disk free
0	unclear
0	okay
0	yes
0	yeah i like that unclear
0	yeah pause dur short i m sort of used i think they re maybe more well i think they think i ll be more bothered by the fact he s a bit confused but just from the you know the
0	yeah less than five times is good
0	oh yeah yeah fair enough
0	but yeah erm thanks for doing the driving unclear i think it s been really worth coming even though we didn t see him very much
0	yeah
0	oh right yeah pause dur short but it s stupid i mean
0	possibly but i think it s literally just taxis unclear
0	that s yeah pause dur short you can use it as a car though
0	oh i see what you mean
0	unclear my glasses
0	how you can unclear
0	i ve i ve still got them on the same key ring yeah pause dur short well cos they were on originally and i just put the new ones on but actually it s it s quite handy having them
0	unclear
0	no well
0	no it was just instinct unclear
0	mm
0	yeah
0	erm yeah one of the nicest ways to do it is to get the sunderland to london train so that s a really nice train pause dur short erm it s quite fast as well
0	and then come out again
0	who s we
0	what what was the situation we we were getting a
0	yeah
0	i was gonna say that that doesn t stop after york so it would have been sort of newcastle sunderland sunderland to london london to unclear which would have been a pain
0	yeah pause dur short i miss the sea
0	er and you unclear to me
0	well i d gone out and i i d been moved down one i think
0	yeah
0	unclear
0	yeah
0	erm what was i going to say yes erm so i thought pause dur short so anyway she was saying when when she was first applying for jobs and there was one erm in hull which she went for the interview and everything and she the feedback was basically we d really really like you but and we d love to give you the job but unfortunately you just don t have any experience pause dur short erm
0	has come up pause dur short in hull yeah pause dur short but this job has come up again and erm she rang the woman and who d you know had given her this feedback and said right pause dur short so if i apply for this job i ve now got a year and whatever how many months of experience in this industry
0	so obviously not unclear
0	yeah they ve taken the top off pause dur short that s really good
0	i think it s very similar but probably slightly better paid erm
0	so so i think it s marketing yeah pause dur short so a similar sort of thing i think just promotions erm and that sort of thing pause dur short i m really pleased that she s managed to make inroads into it because it could have been a bit of nightmare
0	yeah
0	so unclear difficult
0	yeah yeah sure pause dur short yeah he s abled to kind of not earn very much and he can t yeah
0	yeah i mean there s only so much you can pause dur short i mean i i do think it s unfair to because the whole thing about internships in erm was it in government where it was like six months unpaid internships in central london so the only way you could do it was if you had parents who
0	mm pause dur short i think fifty eight it was fifty eighth birthday
0	but anyway yeah erm yeah i mean i don t kind of know how i feel about that because to a certain extent
0	oh dear lord
0	mm
0	which unclear
0	yeah
0	mm
0	yeah
0	to effectively do the majority that s not unclear work
0	without
0	yeah lovely pause dur short yeah i think they might have to er rethink it all pause dur short but i mean it it s hard to know how easy most people find it because i thought it was actually quite a bit you had to do to get it but i mean maybe that s because i was
0	yeah i mean that s ugly there isn t it
0	right
0	well basically they re saying unclear vibration and like unclear
0	or to er you know unclear
0	yeah well exactly unclear
0	yeah unclear
0	unclear we don t you here
0	yes er it s probably not tidal it s wave
0	unclear
0	yeah yeah but it s sort of the same idea look very posh
0	unclear
0	unclear
0	unclear
0	it s stupid pause dur short i i kind of feel like giving them placements is more useful and maybe unclear doing and enjoy doing it
0	yeah
0	yes which was after
0	it s in auf wiedersehen pet isn t it pause dur short it s in billy elliot as well pause dur short have you seen that film
0	about dancing yeah erm but it s yeah it s it s funny and it s it s got a lot of really good erm good scenes in it and it i think you might enjoy it unclear
0	unclear
0	not usually
0	you re not you re not a massive unclear
0	as in i ve seen more picturesque places in my time
0	because durham has a campus in teesside you know durham university
0	why
0	i think it s stockton unclear there s certain courses are taught here it s really weird pause dur short and i think sort of the slightly more vocational ones
0	mm that s that s the point i think durham s got to teach them but on a sort of separate bit so you re not part of the kind of college system
0	erm pause dur short so i think yeah so there s i think erm i know somebody that did sports science at durham but it was in teesside pause dur short you see you don t really win in that regard pause dur short but teesside uni is sort of relatively popular with people but not for you know if if you re gonna go to teesside you may as well go to sunderland kind of thing pause dur short if you re from sunderland i mean
0	yes very
0	well sunderland careers service is actually really helpful erm they felt like they had less of a erm a kind of a trunc s trunc a party line
0	yeah they have a very strong party line about what s what s what they recommend for cvs and stuff whereas the sunderland one felt a lot more flexible erm and they trunc ta trunc they listened to what i was saying and sort of said well we can help you with this and just were a lot more open basically pause dur short the the cambridge one wasn t very open but i guess that s because i was a very very standard case for them pause dur short english two one looking for sort of jobs you know erm not really standing
0	i still can t understand why they helped you unclear
0	so the job for recorders
0	oh right
0	erm we were gonna stick it on there and see if any students were interested so erm
0	only cambridge unclear
0	yeah or any other university yeah pause dur short so i erm you know i logged in to to have a look at the format and sort of erm see what kind of information we needed to put up what unclear erm and you can t see the adverts unless you log in pause dur short so yeah so i logged in and it was my old account and it had all the old searches and all the old jobs that i applied for that was still saved
0	i was registered with all kinds of sites and in the end it didn t really come down to that you know to find jobs on weird internet sites pause dur short it came down to going to a company s website and looking for it and er applying pause dur short they ve got loads of erm ecm information in the er foyer to the university centre
0	oh right
0	right yeah pause dur short unclear remember if they d sort of if you know if if so if you ve come across them somewhere or whether you d gone right i want unclear to help me do all the work
0	no it was great
0	information about unclear
0	yeah
0	er i mean i think i ve come to the conclusion that i don t want to i m not going to unclear reapply for post unclear
0	okay pause dur short okay
0	yes and the problems i have with this sort of aren t i don t think about the job in a lot of ways unclear lifestyle
0	but it s changed unclear anyway and that s not coming back so
0	i mean it seems to me as well that you i mean
0	ah of course yeah
0	unclear
0	be a woman
0	well i think unclear
0	yeah yeah pause dur short so we d have come more
0	unclear
0	erm no i m gonna find that very interesting unclear
0	just sort of going about unclear working on strategy and stuff
0	unclear
0	yeah
0	but unclear experience and learning pause dur short again it s learning about unclear stuff
0	unclear as in i m still unclear
0	no i mean that s really great pause dur short that s the kind of thing that s gonna help you get erm get on as well
0	yeah
0	but they ve yeah they always come out you mean
0	well possibly yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short erm pause dur short erm unclear
0	sort of you mean like the sort of nine to five
0	erm yes we re not so we re not far away now pause dur short it s erm possibly erm six miles to the town pause dur short and it ll be the junction four first erm and we ll go through a roundabout but then we go away from thirsk unclear
0	unclear roundabout i trust then unclear
0	yeah

0	and the accountants still saying no we re not refunding it until they ve provided other card details and i was like but they can t do that
0	it s not it s not a business card pause dur short and he was like so it s the only leverage that we ve got
0	jesus
0	yeah pause dur short blazer on all day pause dur short all day long
0	no no pause dur short this i thought well maybe if it was tighter waist band pause dur short no the waist and is just half way up my boob pause dur short so that s nice that s attractive
0	and i was like oh nice pause dur short so the covers em pause dur short what the fuck client supplier pause dur short fifty odd year old man and a pause dur short cos what do you say did you have a lovely time he was like yeah it was great pause dur short you know totally ruined my weekend but em pause dur short you know totally you know cos he was probably really off his face cos he s an old man pause dur short but em pause dur short but he said yeah we had a lovely time pause dur short he s probably still high now to be fair pause dur short he wasn t really with it pause dur short hilarious
0	cos i told anon nametype m type name our designer who is you know know him much better than i do pause dur short because normally it should fall to them to do the briefing but pause dur short funnily enough they said oh we re really busy pause dur short can you do it well the thing is i m really fucking busy pause dur short unclear it s a different story pause dur short and i told her and she was like no fucking way pause dur short what did you say and obviously there s nothing you can say than lovely

0	ah nice pause dur short ah i could do with a cardigan pause dur short you em aught o message him and say pause dur short we need pictures pause dur short having id cards made for if you ever ever come here
0	yeah so that s a new development pause dur short but i did superglue on my light pause dur short because when i stacked off my bike a few weeks ago the trunc l trunc the light came you know where it fixes it slots in at the top pause dur short underneath the bracket had broken off so it wouldn t stay in the holder so i ve glued it on pause dur short unclear batteries but we ll cross that bridge when we come to it
0	yeah yeah
0	so he s got no fingerprints
0	yeah
0	i always thought that you know if you were going to be a criminal you could put superglue on your fingertips
0	all those all those traceable things
0	that s what i thought pause dur short if it s not you and it s some other anon nametype f type name i thought wow
0	yeah bitch
0	i think we must be related distantly because i know that sounds mental but it s not a a common name pause dur short so i think we re all like all the anon nametype f type name s and all the anon nametype n type name s which is my mum s maiden name we re all related pause dur short so it s all quite em quiet em em eh what s the opposite of common rare scarcer
0	all the rare
0	whatever pause dur short so i figure i m doing nothing this afternoon pause dur short yes pause dur short i was so trunc cl trunc so tempted to pub so tempted to pub
0	really
0	especially on a budget
0	mm mm
0	aqua pause dur short aqua tomorrow that sounds good pause dur short and i might go for a little run after work cos what time is aqua six forty five or something
0	maybe it s six thirty
0	oh that s fine pause dur short so i ll still be home by five pause dur short i mean anon nametype m type name was supposed to come over for dinner but i haven t heard from him he s in some sort of work crisis
0	no pause dur short i wonder if i can give pause dur short oh cos you re not driving or walking

0	i went i went from pause dur short it looks bad because the traffic s at a standstill pause dur short once it moves
0	but to be honest pause dur short em
0	or if i put my swimming if i take my swimming costume with me put it on under my dress that when we get there i just have to strip off
0	might be able to sneak out
0	get the old mobile on the go when i m on my way pause dur short it s looking pretty unhappy
0	so i might drain that away and give it a bit water actually that s a bit grim pause dur short but there is like compost and stiff out there and flower pots so i m thinking i might do that at the weekend
0	yeah got a wash my bike cos it s pretty grim pause dur short thought about going to pound land and looking for car shampoo
0	yes pause dur short yeah that s wise
0	i was going to take things to the charity shop but as much as you know i m in to charity shops i thought if i go in i ll only buy more stuff pause dur short if i m going to car booty things even if i get a pound you know it s better than a poke in the face
0	yeah pause dur short get some right old bargains but i don t need new things
0	i ne dress yes yeah that s definitely going to happen
0	you re not eating any food

0	fine pause dur short well you i mean the best you want to be doing the best don t you you want to be lowering it as much s possible
0	i didn t text anon nametype m type name and tell him did i fucker saying well you know anon nametype m type name you need to take it more seriously you might need to get a personal trainer ra ra ra pause dur short piss off
0	that s obviously how you keep a hymn interested is you just play the game pause dur short which is fine if you want to play the game pause dur short that s fine pause dur short it s entertaining to a degree
0	did they
0	yeah
0	on no hang on pause dur short did she move out before i thought she moved out in january but anon nametype m type name reckons it was before christmas so
0	i thought it was january but who can say

0	that grill that was here though i m sure he said sonly twenty pause dur short twenty twenty twenty five twenty six pause dur short twenty six
0	cos i ve got a brain
0	did i tell did i tell you i was joking to dad about walking round in a bikini
0	secretly cry
0	i won t be having to do that
0	not turns out i m not sure i ll be able to hold that but pause dur short if it s going to result in death then i think i m one be more scared
0	that s what they did pause dur short they slept on the floor
0	like if i have to go on with the kids if i have to go in with the kids i m not going to take it seriously
0	yeah i know
0	yeah pause dur short em
0	hilarious pause dur short so your dad didn t really realise when you would be going then
0	no so when i said this he was like oh right and then twelve weeks training so
0	i plan on just wearing a bikini
0	probably didn t think that through far enough did i
0	i really don t want to go to work tomorrow
0	really
0	really
0	twenty okay well we can offer twenty one would you leave
0	oh okay pause dur short you get a wear a t shirt saying i m a genius or something don t they
0	but em yeah once you re in apple apparently it s quite difficult get promoted pause dur short cos they re all very yeah we all love everything pause dur short frigging nutters pause dur short so they re all like there are all the people that are there are very brand eared like they re very we love apple we all want to progress in the apple
0	mm mm pause dur short yeah that would cheese you right off
0	a bit mental pause dur short secret squirrel things
0	nobody would go and talk to them cos they do their own secret thing so unclear no one really understands that but it s fine
0	but can we still use your unclear
0	i was talking to somebody from anon type place trunc ases trunc anon type place actually
0	anon nametype m type name pause dur short the anon nametype m type name
0	well yeah that s what i mean pause dur short i see the name and i think ooh liz might know him and i think how the fucks that going to happen
0	definitely going to look him up in connections tomorrow pause dur short but em so they restructured this restructure about six months ago pause dur short and em and obviously now we we re now in in the new restructure pause dur short and one of them has been headhunted y the head of trunc in trunc you know anon type place it s like an alternative to a level pause dur short has been head hunted to be the head of anon type place pause dur short she s going to go and work in anon type place but she s going to you know
0	how the hell did that happen
0	yeah yeah cos everyone was like have you heard anon nametype f type name s leaving i was like no hang on wait a minute let me get go through my trash pause dur short em and they said yeah she s you know she s been recruited to be head of whatever and we re all very excited blah de blah pause dur short okay wow it s amazing pause dur short speaking to anon nametype f type name it turns out the they that she works in education and i work in elt that their head of education was headhunted first pause dur short she turned it down but said to her boss like the director i ve been headhunted i want a better position and i want more money and they went okay oh my god right stay and we ll create this new this new role for you which was announced last week and now i know why because that that was her bargaining chip pause dur short cos she was the one who was actually headhunted pause dur short she turned it down anon nametype f type name she turned it down and now anon nametype f type name s got it pause dur short but it s so good because i mean it s a trunc n trunc it s a fantastic opportunity for anybody to be em headhunted at that level but it s a woman pause dur short like it s a female pause dur short it s really good pause dur short it s really really good pause dur short cos even though publishing is a is a real female orientated industry the top jobs are still blokes
0	yeah pause dur short it s the same in any industry isn t it i know it sound really old fashioned but it s true pause dur short you hot a certain level and then it s male dominated
0	yeah
0	i think it s because men are men are easier at piggy backing pause dur short i ve said this for years pause dur short a good manager a good ceo is a good piggy backer pause dur short they re not good at anything themselves but they re god a seeing who s good at the stuff and using people
0	and i think women and less incline to do that
0	and see even above the top line pause dur short like my dad was saying and i was debating going in as an officer or a rating i was like i don t really want to i want to be invoked with people pause dur short and he was like no no no do you want to be giving the orders or taking the orders pause dur short and i was like yeah but it ll be your whole if cos you ll be there all the time pause dur short there s no going home from work pause dur short and he was like yeah but you re still going to have friends there pause dur short they ll just be on a similar level to you pause dur short and i said but like he said well i never went home did i i was on the side i said but were you friends with them he said no pause dur short i said well there you go i want friendships out of it pause dur short and he said well i still go out with them but they re more acquaintances pause dur short and for him it was very easy and it always has been he s always down the same job pause dur short that
0	yeah and i think i think girls naturally find it more difficult cos you don t pause dur short i think girls like to please each other more than man do
0	mm
0	and before i left i was trying to encourage him to retain to work on his retention but he just he don t pause dur short he wanted to do it but he just never really implemented it pause dur short and i said well i m doing all this marketing i need a bigger marketing base pause dur short so every time somebody asks for a quote i should have their details i should have their at least their email address whack on marketing list pause dur short i said cos as long as it s relevant to them then we re not spamming them
0	oh god
0	as is as if he s done it
0	have they got a copy writer in to do it or would they just have done it themselves
0	but we do have a typesetter pause dur short like anon nametype f type name works on indesign pause dur short how the hell she let that go through pause dur short i think it s more of a a thing of taste as opposed to anything else
0	yeah but i was like what the fuck
0	gutted
0	anon nametype f type name i ve just thought of something pause dur short what are you doing now
0	em i m getting a yoghurt

0	they ll make me buy another card
0	i think that might be the option
0	he was on a crusade
0	wow that sounds usual
0	how can one one lots of people say yeah he s fucking insane
0	fucking crazy
0	they don t do that do they
0	oh so the crazy person says he s not crazy he says he s a political activist
0	the crazy person thinks that it would be worse to send you to a psychiatric ward
0	playing scenarios
0	just a bit messy i think bit fiddle some
0	i mean unless we all you know have medical degrees
0	or that crazy guy we watched the other day pause dur short we need to do eight minute abs pause dur short i probably should have done that before i had the ice cream
0	you managed to do ten real press ups
0	no
0	yeah
0	but i it s quite it takes your mind off the fact that you re rowing cos that s fucking boring let s be honest pause dur short but
0	yeah i don t have that game
0	i really want to see if i can do a boy press up pause dur short i don t think i can
0	mm mm pause dur short i think i might actually die if i tried to do one pause dur short i ll try and do one in a minute when i ve eaten my from you pause dur short but today man alive pause dur short i tried to get out of bed and i went ah pause dur short cos he was getting me to do ones for my top abs and one for my lower abs or something

0	no me neither pause dur short she was in here earlier and she barely looked up
0	it was really nice but em pause dur short i m just thinking it i appreciate that he s really making an effort to be quiet but i you have it s always hoping to wake us up pause dur short cos it s a relay the walls are really thin and the bokes are noisy and if you are owing to be getting up at that time just don t leave your bike out the front pause dur short go out the back pause dur short because i can hear anon nametype f type name in the kitchen pause dur short she was up pause dur short and that s what fucks you off like why do we wake up just because your boyfriend s staying and

0	it s like really erm i was like why is everyone not doing this vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	i don t think it needs to be brilliant
0	unclear that ll do unclear i guess in something
0	it ll be so flavoursome
0	it s just that yeah i was i cos i was
0	i was thinking about the noodles they ll be fine
0	vocal desc laugh
0	that s a distracting thought
0	vocal desc laugh that will be delicious
0	yeah
0	it was really good
0	it was so good i just felt really run down and like erm you know and you just feel like
0	oh my god
0	in the house cos i didn t feel ill enough that i was like oh can t go anywhere
0	but like it s trunc wor trunc it s like nice work like
0	i was really excited about it like i actually every night this week i ve not wanted to do the thing where i ve had
0	faraway place
0	so i m really tired i just wanna
0	what was the article
0	but so it s really interesting it s just a bit it s quite trunc har trunc it s quite well trodden ground in a way i m sort of looking at like the situation now and how it s evolved since the policy was first introduced but er mainly like policy stuff into the thing
0	this targets muslims is not enough
0	for that is you have to make the case more for unclear and i think it s probably more interesting anyway to make
0	so like freedom of speech
0	yeah
0	which is what they re doing quite specific
0	yeah
0	yeah it is interesting
0	different tack
0	yeah
0	and also because it s been written about on like quite a lot so
0	yeah
0	i thought it was a bit more interesting sort of like should a government be fighting ideas which is what they ve said they want to
0	like yeah it was just trunc rea trunc it was really challenging to do and
0	what the kind of like unclear laws unclear of like not being able to like think
0	it s exactly the same sort of thing and we ve now got like a definition of extremism on unclear the statute unclear
0	unclear so it s not just that it s bad to be a terrorist or unclear
0	it s just being an extremist is prohibited which is kind of edging towards
0	yeah
0	like possible yeah
0	and stuff yeah
0	yeah
0	and obviously most of them are really bad at it cos they just
0	far right far right extremism
0	but that that s just like it s so like
0	so much better than any but like i
0	yeah in other countries
0	yeah
0	or unclear other places unclear which is quite interesting whereas here
0	that is interesting
0	mm yeah it was super interesting but i just had lots of other like bitty bits of work i had a thing to do with
0	yeah
0	but i trunc d trunc i just like didn t do anything for them after that cos the guy was a complete idiot like
0	ah thanks so much
0	soya sauce
0	tomorrow i was like it s very unlikely
0	yeah
0	but erm there were just a few things that
0	yeah it was great just that s what was a bit annoying about it is that the piece was really interesting and like the it was really fun working on it but then all the stuff unclear was just too stressful
0	crazy is it like an academy
0	no it s a further education college
0	are they like they re like what are they
0	it s like fuck off
0	yeah
0	it s like if you know anything about journalist unclear topics unclear
0	yeah
0	very you know she was very reasonable she very specifically wanted to check about people s immigration statuses
0	yeah
0	just like i ve also probably been a journalist for longer than she has
0	so i know i m i mean i think we re about the same age
0	yeah
0	but
0	like lawyers and teachers just check and you make it clear you say i m not gonna trunc chan trunc make any
0	that is good
0	if there s anything you don t like and i ll change it you know i do on stuff like that like i see why it s not good to let people approve it cos they always wanna change random stuff but but
0	mm so is that a general rule you never send it to
0	yeah
0	or a safety unclear issue unclear
0	yeah
0	yeah definitely yeah if it s like safety or pause dur short employment or like unclear
0	and you can just be very clear
0	yeah erm
0	it s a bit so that s why it s not good to do it but i trunc wou trunc i mean i wouldn t do it in the normal circumstances but it was really annoying being like given loads of shit for it when i was like i don t they didn t agree to anything unreasonable i don t think
0	also unclear forty five minutes of really stuff go back and forth when i had like not very long to write the thing and then like i arranged for the trunc wo trunc the photographer to go into the college so i spoke to the woman like sorted that out for the next day and er the photographer just didn t turn up erm he was such a dick she had said she was seeing the same class who i had met and interviewed the next morning she was like well i i just wanna ask the class if they re alright with the photographer
0	like if you knew that was happening
0	yeah
0	surely you would check your email at like ten but she just didn t check an email i heard from the woman at like pause dur short yeah like eleven and she was like oh the photographer hasn t arrived like i haven t heard from him so and i called the editor she got in touch with him and so he went just went to the wrong site i d given him the full address pause dur short so the wrong site
0	but like so unclear
0	over
0	mm
0	i think it s so interesting where look at like trunc ju trunc i trunc imagi trunc like yeah it s probably like whoever like the editor is just being like okay we ve been given this like new news thing unclear
0	yeah
0	and like that american guy coming in and being like
0	about all that stuff cos it made it stressful and i was like
0	yeah how much did sorry that s
0	that s alright
0	no no not at all it was like two hundred pounds
0	mm
0	yeah
0	but erm yeah it was good
0	like vocal desc laugh
0	yeah is it something you wanna do more of like that kind of like
0	instantaneous
0	mm
0	i guess so
0	i mean it ll be so unclear
0	anon nametype f type name
0	anon nametype f type name
0	yeah
0	unclear
0	is it oh good i m really glad it was worth the mission
0	i think erm
0	yeah
0	erm and like i kept really hoping like like this unclear coming up like he ll be coming up the stairs with him and be like please let it be anon nametype m type name coming into the office vocal desc laugh
0	you want some company
0	need someone just to like be there
0	you have
0	mm yeah i do feel a bit bad for missing it but
0	anon nametype f type name s got this thing vocal desc laugh he was like unclear but vocal desc laugh
0	cos i thought maybe after the dinner i might go to anon nametype f type name s thing but if they ve like cooked loads of food and gone to loads loads of effort and like figured out the numbers and
0	yeah she won t notice anyway once she s in unclear the party unclear it s just that thing before
0	yes
0	when you re like
0	i just thought i was sort of like it was one of those things when she first changed it i was like oh she cancelled so much unclear and i was like oh it is a bit pause dur short it s been planned for so long and i can go to both things cos it s like anon type place in anon type place then i would have to cancel probably to go to anon type place cos
0	and you went to see her last night so fine
0	mm
0	yeah i really wanna go have to invite myself round
0	it s very proper i realised though like
0	i ll go round for a visit

0	i mean that types of things happens when you move in somewhere as well doesn t it even if it s not yours
0	yeah
0	like you just
0	yeah
0	totally decadent but it s really great
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	do that but pause dur short yeah
0	mm
0	yeah
0	and so so
0	no you ve just gotta like further stress of it
0	like
0	quite stressed and busy
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	unclear
0	yeah i
0	oh i don t think it yeah
0	and trunc l trunc like but the world like that the world should not be like that
0	mm
0	so
0	yeah
0	mm no that s true
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	like what we trunc thi trunc it s like service industries it s much more like
0	yeah
0	yeah that s interesting
0	but i think but i just like i strongly believe that some jobs are better than other jobs
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	well they get like a day normally no it s not a whole week they get like a day off a week normally but most of them will save it up and go for a
0	and for me it s odd cos i m like well what they have a really different conception of what life is
0	yeah
0	mm
0	it s like that kind of like
0	cos if you yeah
0	but it s like the futility of like that i think that s what it like er just like well that stuff just highlights like
0	and the bullshit of like erm sort of consumer trunc demo trunc
0	like it was so annoying like
0	like vote with your purse like
0	yeah
0	and like pause dur short it s like until yeah it just and it s kind of like being a vegetarian as well like it s just really pointless
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	it does help people get by
0	oh sorry can i keep the thank you
0	i don t know what i think about it
0	i think i i mean i think they ll like they they feed
0	and i know
0	yeah
0	it s like pause dur short sure you re like but it s like government subsidising the developer is what it becomes
0	yeah
0	and the thing is until you until you increase the stock of houses all that means is that those homes then just go straight back into the
0	the market
0	as soon as they re sold off like you re back to where you ve started
0	yeah
0	what s that
0	for a starter home
0	and that s getting rid of the affordable homes
0	oh
0	and what they are the new builds
0	mm
0	and like the way to like there are set like the like yeah i told you about like the green belt like so if like the one if you wanted to do it if you wanted to do
0	you you ve got trunc r trunc unclear
0	i ve read about this before
0	build the green belt legislation tomorrow you would bottom out the trunc h trunc housing market by flooding
0	the market with new homes which would then be
0	so that has to happen so no one else
0	it s insane it s trunc ins trunc in london it s just obscene it s
0	and it would be a problem for someone like anon nametype f type name for example like
0	like much nicer the majority of people wouldn t so like it would just be like not only would it like decrease in value but the places that people afford would also
0	it s hard isn t it
0	yeah you do it slowly
0	yeah
0	like like so much of that land is unproductive
0	yeah
0	like i dunno like moscow or trunc st trunc seoul or something it s going say well aren t haven t we built on like
0	thirty per thirty percent of the uk is built on or something
0	yeah
0	mm
0	yeah
0	and guidelines and
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	and like they re really incredible like but it s like
0	yeah
0	it was like people in the city were like all these poor people are moving down and building these like
0	really
0	yeah
0	aggregates all the information because it s political and there s it s like once you start to put it together and you actually i mean there s like percentages and stuff but until
0	you start to see like the mod owns this this family of aristocrats own this like like ex mps
0	grandad owns it there s there s this guy kevin cahill who wrote this amazing book called who owns britain
0	it s so and it s really radical and he s like
0	yeah
0	yeah it s really it makes me really depressed it s so shit
0	yeah
0	i keep talking to people who are like oh yeah i ve i saw one of my old colleagues the other day and she was saying another woman we used to work with who i used to work with who s quite senior and she and her husband were buying and they started off looking in like anon type place and anon type place and now they re looking at somewhere in like anon type place like south of anon type place with no proper transport links and stuff so they just need to buy something so but compromises that you make
0	yeah
0	the way this
0	is so expensive once it had gone up they ve got no interest in like at least a a private landlord
0	yeah
0	up up up yeah
0	yeah it s crazy
0	but like when you put it like that that is that is really that is
0	like or moving up
0	er so no it s not and then
0	that is crazy isn t it
0	yeah vocal desc laugh when you compare it to
0	yeah yeah
0	yeah it s crazy
0	really
0	that is so crazy
0	it s it s like yeah i dunno like even like with those distances i just think
0	but there might i just think you have to start thinking about it different like you have to think about like it s one of the things like it s like making you can invest in london being much more multimodal
0	but like if you properly invested in like and i trunc th trunc i think they are trying to but like you said very haphazard
0	yeah it makes sense
0	but like there s like sprawl already like in south london there is so much low density semi detached housing
0	yeah
0	blocks within
0	yeah it could be better couldn t it
0	it s just interests
0	yeah it s really unclear shit unclear
0	that s the seat of power
1	so trunc h trunc how s your day gone
1	well i i it was good that i left early this morning because i erm it was a bit further than i anticipated and so i had to vocal desc laugh skate get my skates on erm when i arrived at the trunc c trunc pub carpark everybody was there fortunately nobody else had got there desperately early so erm it wasn t a big deal in the end although i was panicking towards the end of the journey
1	you weren t leading it
1	no no no i wasn t the leader erm i can t remember who was trunc l trunc oh anon nametype f type name was the leader anon nametype f type name was the leader yeah
1	and was it anon type place or anon type place you seemed to be a bit
1	it was
1	undecided
1	well we went to the village of anon type place cos we went to the pub in anon type place but we were walking around anon type place but we went round a different direction than we d done before so i didn t recognise any of it
1	well there s quite a bit of it
1	mm
1	i mean we went up here years ago
1	mm
1	that may be the last time i went do you remember there was a snowy weekend
1	mm
1	one january
1	i don t trunc rea trunc the things the place we walked round i don t recall remembering any of it from that trip though
1	well it is kind of a bit difficult to
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i mean it s all kind of flat and looks the same really
1	yeah trunc d trunc we did we go past the anon type place centre
1	i don t think they had a anon type place centre
1	well they ve got a cottage which is a anon type place centre it s only open at the weekends but the we went past that certainly but we didn t go past a er a a major sort of show building or anything like that at all
1	well did you go to the main entrance i d have thought there was only one
1	no we didn t no no no er somebody else said we think we re sneaking in the back door
1	mm
1	we seemed to go through lots of fields and things the one that s really nice there was okay winter it was fairly low sun but because there wasn t much cloud there was the sun behind all the unclear reeds unclear you have the flags that wave about so they really looked quite spectacular oh and we saw some horses we saw some horses the funny horses in the
1	oh now that the funny horses we saw from a walk from the walk from anon type place didn t we
1	yeah was that with anon nametype f type name
1	yeah is that the same place
1	yeah yeah
1	i don t really know the geography but you said you might head for anon type place
1	yeah well yeah i got there via anon type place so it s quite a bit further out from anon type place yeah yes these are przewalski horses or something
1	mm
1	but that quite happy on the quite coarse grazing there we saw some highland cattle as well both were quite a long way away the horses looked very suspicious they were watching us go there was about twelve of them they were trunc qui trunc about well i dunno six seven hundred metres away but they were watching us very suspiciously vocal desc laugh
1	i wonder if you d gone into anon type place proper would you not have to show your national trust membership
1	i don t know i don t know i don t
1	well did you
1	no not at all there was no we didn t go through any barriers or gates or anything
1	and not even at the anon type place centre
1	no no that was at the side of the public road you know
1	mm was that part of anon type place or not
1	it trunc w trunc it vocal desc misc it may have been i m not entirely sure
1	mm
1	it seemed to be a trunc cer trunc well there was a sign on their fence that said anon type place national trust that way with an arrow
1	mm
1	you know but i don t know if that was actually a national trust building at all
1	mm and you had your lunch in anon type place
1	yeah the pub was very nice the anon type place i think it was yeah
1	does do they just have one do you think is it that sort of place
1	yes i think so it s not a big place but the the funny thing was just as we were about to set up another walking group arrived and they were having lunch at the pub as well so we vocal desc laugh checked the times fortunately they weren t eating till one o clock and we were we d set to twelve thirty but when we left after the meal the pub was actually stuffed to the gunnels
1	mm
1	there wasn t a spare space anywhere for food so they obviously they the food was very good so they ve obviously got quite a reputation
1	what did you have
1	oh i had stroganoff
1	uhu
1	which was superb somebody else had a sandwich which came a doorstep sandwich which came with a load of chips and green stuff and they were only expecting a thin unclear girly unclear sandwich
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh so they were a bit
1	so everyone was happy with that one
1	oh yeah oh yeah i think everybody did well you know so what have you been up to
1	well erm largely sorting out my online accounts which i made sure i could access them properly i also just wanted to update my well i wanted to be sure i knew what sort of interest i was getting on accounts
1	vocal desc laugh bugger all i imagine
1	because when my pension comes through i ll have the opportunity of putting some more money in
1	mm
1	an interest trunc a trunc
1	mm
1	er in a a savings sort of account
1	vocal desc cough
1	erm and also setting up an isa for the year
1	have you have you found anything worthwhile for
1	erm
1	interest wise
1	well i know where i m going to put my money initially because it s always easier to open another account with a building society
1	oh yeah
1	you re already with
1	but we the national pause dur short savings pensioner bonds were quite a good interest rate
1	mm
1	but they may have gone down after the first year all of these things seem to go down
1	yeah
1	after a year
1	yeah
1	don t they
1	and erm oh there is pause dur short yeah i saw something that had twelve months of interest on it interesting interest
1	interesting interest
1	i think it was a tesco account
1	yeah i had some money in that but they ve they sent me a letter saying they re reducing the interest rate to the square root of bugger all you know
1	oh is that their current account
1	no no no i had erm i just had a a a savings account
1	oh
1	of some description i think it was kind of at two percent
1	well have a look again
1	yeah
1	and cos i think you can get if you do an internet one you can one point seven five for the first year
1	mm
1	so i m going to work on the current account cos you said you get some interest on that
1	from from which which trunc comp trunc
1	tesco
1	mm no i didn t say you get interest on the current account from tescos
1	oh i think you did cos you told me you ve got one
1	no i haven t got a current account with tescos
1	well anyway i have well i m in the process of getting one and then i ve trunc g trunc obviously i won t open the the one where you only get the high interest for a year until i ve actually got the money to put in it
1	well
1	erm but i ought to trunc d trunc i i mean you don t get very much at all but i ve got to do something with it and depending on how much money i get you know that rate has gone down to er the protection is seventy five thousand
1	mm yes yes you of course if you re gonna get a big lump sum you re gonna have to spread it around ain t you
1	well i ve it s not gonna be so large i have to spread it very far
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but because of the way i
1	well you re a moneyed woman aren t you vocal desc laugh
1	the way i ve got erm accounts set up erm i do need to fiddle around with my nationwide one to make sure that s a legit
1	mm
1	erm and they will nationwide will let you take ten thousand pounds out of any erm account if it helps you get your you know without a penalty if it helps you get your money down
1	oh gets you under the er is it
1	mm
1	eighty five thousand now
1	well it was eighty five it s gonna go down to seventy five from january
1	oh right oh that s unclear fine unclear
1	and there s a on one of the sites it talked about and after april i think it is all erm interest account is gonna pay er without tax being deducted so
1	so is that
1	you have to
1	is that
1	declare your own tax presumably
1	oh that s
1	but
1	well that s bloody stupid isn t it because that means
1	seems it s it s likely to cause more employment opportunities in the er the the tax department
1	in the tax well more trunc opp trunc or opportunities with accountants as well i suspect
1	well it makes it a bit more complicated i i i can t see any good reason for it erm
1	no i d have thought it would have been easier for the inland revenue because it was all done corporately so they got a big wodge of money from each bank and they didn t have to pursue it
1	mm
1	now they re gonna get little dribbles of money from or little dribbles of sort of tax demands from that millions of people
1	unless they think it s a way of checking if you give so much interest one year and give get a lot more interest the next year perhaps that s a way of sussing out who s got more who s you know who s got money they haven t declared but i mean don t
1	mm
1	unscrupulous people won t actually declare it will they i mean
1	well no quite yeah
1	you d only trunc dec trunc er declare it at whatever you re allowed to have every year
1	because
1	so it s a bit strange really
1	yeah cos when you fill in a tax return you still have to declare interest but they crosscheck that against what they ve returned cos i used to get that when i did the detailed tax return unclear they they would think unclear they would mash their figures to mine
1	uhu
1	and often they weren t exactly the same but as long as they were fairly close they didn t seem to worry too much about it
1	and have you erm heard about the second home business
1	no what s gonna happen on that
1	if you buy a second home or potentially if you buy pause dur short a new house before you ve sold your old house or anything like this
1	mm
1	erm you have to pay higher rates of stamp duty
1	oh yeah i ve heard about that i m not i wasn t sure of the erm how it was hedged about with erm advantages and restrictions so cos you know sometimes you don t sell them by at the same time and so
1	well i don t know i mean apparently they re gonna have to have a month or two months to suss out what it might mean
1	mm
1	but i think it s an attempt to try and share the houses round more people
1	well which is not that
1	but
1	i still like westminster council s idea that if you re not registered to vote there you pay a lot more tax
1	mm
1	i think that s a brilliant idea
1	well
1	because it catches empty property as well
1	mm
1	that s the thing that so often escapes the net
1	and they might be going to charge people from abroad more
1	mm
1	er well at least as much as everyone else has to pay
1	charge them what stamp trunc d trunc
1	well trunc h trunc the the trunc m trunc even if they ve only even when they buy their first one
1	mm yeah
1	but it might
1	vocal desc cough
1	it will make it a bit more expensive for erm
1	inward investment
1	landlords to buy
1	mm
1	multiple properties
1	yes i did recall
1	but i mean unless it s expensive it s not gonna make a huge difference
1	no it ll just push the prices back up again wouldn t it which is not
1	well it may depress prices for a while it may just put rents up
1	i think the only thing that ll depress prices is building a hell of a sight more houses
1	well
1	well i think the government
1	we don t really want that do we
1	well i don t know you know
1	well if we want it but it s not in our back garden
1	yes vocal desc laugh that s right yes
1	but probably living in the houses in the parts of the country where there aren t jobs would help
1	well that s right yeah and unclear
1	and why build on any more of the countryside why make anon type place three times as big because there might be people living here and then
1	mm why trunc d trunc why did anon type place move from anon type place to anon type place you know they said unclear nominally unclear was to be near the university but i these days with communication and things like that good grief you don t really need to be physically near anywhere do you they re not physically near their manufacturing plants which are all in the far east
1	mm mm
1	so there must be another reason
1	well i mean maybe it s easier to get the labour down here
1	mm the skilled labour
1	the skill
1	i wouldn t have thought so we are maybe like yeah i don t know i know anon nametype f type name was erm could get i m fairly certain she could get a job there but vocal desc cough they re not a good company to work for apparently
1	well if she doesn t absolutely need a job but could have a job then that puts her in a good position
1	oh yeah yeah she s very highly skilled
1	anyway she may be doing enough with what she s got
1	yeah she s not earning big money but anon nametype m type name s earning good enough so
1	mm
1	and they ve paid off their mortgage so they re quite they re sitting pretty really
1	anyway how how are we left with this front door
1	erm we have to lock it from the inside to lock it the cos you can open it from the outside now if you ve not locked it with a key from the inside you can just open it from the outside
1	mm
1	yeah because it hasn t got as there s a thing called a split pause dur short barrel no it s not a barrel a split something or other which we ve not got at the moment cos that s part of the problem the locksmith has ordered the part we need and when it comes in he will phone me to let me know
1	i take it he didn t really like the lock you took in
1	no he was he was quite amenable he says it s a he says it s a bit unusual he says erm it s not a standard lock because when i looked on the web on to find out it s all a great thing you can actually look on the web and look this all up
1	mm
1	the standard locks are seventeen millimetres wide and you can buy whole replacement locks for about a hundred pounds you know having said that the barrels and handles are all separate again you know and the handles are twenty quid
1	mm you fitted a very stylish erm door trunc ha trunc door handle on your door
1	it s it s the only one they had vocal desc laugh in the right size
1	oh
1	the and erm the
1	it doesn t no unclear i haven t seen it very closely
1	it s it s very carefully fitted because it
1	mm
1	cos it s much narrower than the old one but when he gets the part he ll phone me and i ll go in and collect it it s gonna be a lot of money could be up to a hundred quid for this part and then i had to ring back take the whole mechanism off again and replace the bit the lock behind the centre
1	mm
1	and he says it s a bit fiddly to do he says but but he seemed to be quite confident i could do it so they were very busy when i was in there really busy cutting keys like men possessed they were
1	oh what s mm it s not a particularly trunc s trunc time of the year for students to be starting
1	no no these were pause dur short unclear locals unclear
1	would it be a good opportunity or would it be a not a good opportunity to take the keys round when you go back
1	take the key round where
1	you know i need some keys cutting cos we decided one of the keys we only had one of didn t we
1	oh which the front door or back door
1	i don t know perhaps you found some more for the patio door in the end one of the doors there was only one of them
1	no for the back doors we ve certainly got a we ve got two sets complete sets of keys for everything
1	mm well i think we ought to no i think have we got more than trunc t trunc one one each for the front door
1	well i don t know where was the key you gave me is that your normal front door key
1	are we talking about here
1	yeah
1	i m not
1	ah that
1	so okay
1	actually changes the issue yes right carry on
1	that that key
1	reset
1	okay let s talk about keys here then first the key that is in the front door is the one that lives in my my belt so if i go out
1	is that your main key
1	my main key is slightly bent and belongs with my
1	right so
1	with my car key
1	you ve got two keys and i ve got one so we ve got three keys basically
1	okay so i ve got a slightly bent key and i ve got a key that isn t bent the reason i ve got the other one is because i don t always take my car keys out when i go out at the moment cos i quite often go in your car and but i have also got a spare key upstairs
1	so we ve got four keys one of which is bent okay and you re holding on to three of them vocal desc laugh
1	well it hangs it s it s hanging on the chest of drawers upstairs
1	alright okay
1	on a long loop of string and i put it there in case i had to throw it out the window for anon nametype f type name if i if i couldn t get down trunc t trunc you know if i needed her to come in
1	oh right
1	that s how we got up there
1	okay fine
1	but i ll bring that one down and
1	no no unclear you can use that unclear
1	use it in the front door because i d rather have one in my
1	okay
1	in my belt
1	yeah we ll in while we re messing about for the next two days do that swap them round yeah erm now did you want to say there was something about the keys that unclear
1	yeah i m sure
1	i m not sure what sets of keys we had we had hundreds of keys and most of them didn t fit anything you know
1	yeah but i m sure there was one door we only had one key for is it actually a good time to actually go round is it good when you go back to collect it to have keys cut or or is it better to keep that transaction simple
1	well i can do the same fine yeah i m er i ve half a mind to take take the whole thing off and take it with me and get them to do it
1	well if you do
1	he trunc s trunc he seemed er i said do you need me to take door oh no he says it s quite easy you can do it yourself he says yeah
1	well that s up to you
1	mm
1	if it when are you going to do it
1	actually well when he gets the part in probably
1	and when when
1	friday he says day or two
1	friday okay well
1	oh what day is it
1	if you re going to take
1	do we have to put the bins out tonight
1	it s your black bin this week
1	oh i put it out it s got quite a lot in it
1	oh have you been throwing things away
1	yeah i ve been throwing lots of things away i will not let you look cos you ll wanna keep everything
1	what are have you been throwing away
1	no nothing of any weight or trunc impor trunc
1	oh
1	vocal desc cough
1	erm i have put a smelly fish thing in it
1	a smelly fish thing
1	you know that under
1	unclear what s unclear
1	under sort of under thing you get in
1	ah right
1	unclear fish
1	from where you bought it from er
1	yes
1	the trunc supermar trunc yeah okay packing it s called i think
1	yes it s a sort of i think it s meant to absorb any nasties but it can certainly absorb a lot of fish smell
1	so we could have the cat in the bin tonight then
1	no it s not that strong i gave it a wipe over
1	mm vocal desc laugh i haven t seen any of next door s cats for a while
1	mm
1	cos they don t like the wind pause dur short so
1	so erm now tomorrow you said you d got you ve got something in the morning
1	i m going to the genome project in the morning
1	are you you ve been saying for weeks you re going there is this
1	yeah trunc ye trunc
1	the time you really go
1	they kept moving it around yeah yeah
1	have you been there before
1	yeah i have i have i didn t realise well that s some the thing i remember from pause dur short er somebody was trying to get some concept of how much data is involved in having a complete genotype
1	mm
1	and somebody said well you need about a terabyte hard drive to hold it
1	mm
1	so that gives you a pretty good idea how much information is involved rather a lot vocal desc laugh
1	yeah i mean it depends how they ve got it stored really i mean
1	they ve got a lot of
1	do you just mean a terabyte as in my trunc har trunc my pause dur short my removable
1	drive yeah
1	yeah i mean i
1	per person
1	oh per person
1	per person pause dur short so vocal desc laugh yeah you can imagine the amount of storage they ve got to
1	well it s a lot of messages to get you know
1	mm
1	you don t want your left leg coming out like your right leg do you
1	no
1	i mean you need them different
1	i might actually take my er my genotype my the little bit of information i ve got with me
1	mm
1	and if there s time ask the question you know so they almost certainly the guide won t be able to tell give me anything tell me anything but pause dur short but er i i
1	make your own up with
1	vocal desc laugh
1	coloured shapes
1	yeah vocal desc laugh trunc m trunc my i get the impression they did the four genotype because the research panel expressed an interest cos
1	mm
1	when the erm cardiac specialist saw it it wasn t room trunc f trunc it was the other one her boss i think he says we ll have a bit of a job justifying actually running the genotype cos they ve got it s about seven thousand quid it reckoned it cost although on my information now it s down to about two now
1	well isn t that the price unclear to do things unclear
1	yeah and erm then i said oh i m on the er on the the research trunc pane trunc oh he said then in that case there might be some quite a lot of advantages for trunc doi trunc for getting you to do it if we do you
1	mm
1	then we can store it and use it for as part of the research panel as well so
1	so are you going to have your your erm your drive done in coloured bricks to
1	vocal desc laugh
1	follow you er
1	tca tcaff i think
1	yes
1	or whatever it is yeah
1	i was thinking of the path you know
1	oh right oh that would be fun wouldn t it trunc st trunc yeah
1	imagine by get a longer path but it s quite long
1	the trunc ye trunc
1	isn t it
1	yeah vocal desc laugh it s never gonna be long enough though is it
1	no and you could do a little bit of it
1	mm mm
1	anon nametype m type name might not be up for it
1	mm
1	oh the
1	oh he ll be up for anything if you pay him enough money
1	yeah
1	yeah but i think we might end up with ashfelt actually
1	so
1	yes
1	so erm just think you re so you re doing that in the morning
1	yeah
1	and then you re coming back
1	yeah
1	and that s the afternoon you can take the my my reserve rollator
1	mm
1	to anon type place
1	yeah
1	and i trunc h trunc i thought really i should go first and sort my clothes out before collection
1	uhu
1	but i could a either make a start on doing that just for a few minutes pause dur short i see i don t trunc kno trunc
1	all your all your all your boxes of clothes are carefully labelled are they
1	well all the ones in the wardrobe are labelled
1	uhu
1	so they re they re fine it s the ones that erm are pause dur short it s you know those big plasticy ones that are red yellow and blue with wheels
1	oh boxes not big plasticky clothes
1	no no you know the big ones
1	yeah yeah yeah ones the ones that look like treasure chests
1	yes
1	yeah
1	exactly erm and possibly could be yeah i don t know i suppose they plastic goes a bit brittle cos i could probably
1	mm
1	sell them otherwise couldn t i
1	yeah
1	on gumtree and buy something probably a little more appropriate
1	yeah
1	or indeed possibly eliminate them now i ve got the other ones erm pause dur short i don t know how much they ve got in and they re quite bulky
1	mm so what i need to do is before i go is to fold all the back of the car down
1	well you re gonna have the rollator in anyway don t worry about doing it before you go
1	no it makes more sense to do it before you go cos it means i can take the cover off and it s a lot easier to do here
1	trunc oka trunc is it cos i thought
1	oh yes
1	you could be doing it at anon type place while i m sorting out
1	no it doesn t take very long but if i m gonna take things out the car it s a lot easier to do it here cos i shove it all in the garage then
1	okay pause dur short erm
1	i need a few minutes cos i ve got when i went on the walk i i vocal desc laugh i put the big thick sweater on where you know it was glorious weather this morning
1	it was wasn t it
1	and i sort of rummaged through my bag of bad weather clothes and just took the neck warmer with me
1	mm

1	oh that s quite a nice group then
1	yeah and the erm there was an older couple that the end of our table today and we mentioned something about it and they said what s that about
1	mm
1	so i explained it and they re quite keen to come pause dur short anon nametype m type name asked to he asked to buy erm one of my poetry anthologies
1	oh that s good
1	for it
1	have you got any left
1	he actually gave me the money well i m running out now
1	oh well make sure you keep enough for yourself
1	yeah because erm er anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name asked for copies last time so i took them
1	mm
1	and they coughed out the money and this guy was i don t know if this older couple are a bit on the periphery of the group cos they didn t seem to know a lot of what was going on i think they ve not come for a few
1	mm
1	and erm he was looking through it and he says i have you got i want one if you ve got one i said oh
1	oh
1	i ve got them all with me
1	well i mean maybe you could email around the others and see if they ve got any trunc d trunc that they don t want to sell
1	mm yeah if i get
1	i mean
1	numbers very low i will but they didn t have very many you know normally i print ten and give trunc everybo trunc sell everybody ten
1	mm
1	but i ve told them to tell me their numbers this year
1	oh i see
1	but as much
1	i thought they had to have the same number
1	trunc m trunc no no it s much lower numbers this year so that s why the price went up a little bit because i needed a print run of eighty
1	mm
1	instead of the usual hundred hundred and twenty
1	mm
1	so
1	and tell me now er you re you re you re you ve said something about your family history you ve made some progress
1	oh oh no you re you re talking about tomorrow
1	oh yes of course
1	i ve got this it meeting tomorrow and i can t remember if it s a lecture or a committee meeting
1	i think it s at six
1	then it s a committee meeting then it should be a committee meeting then that s not so much of a problem it will be useful tomorrow afternoon if i did the rolling display for the next erm lecture then i can trunc gi trunc
1	so you won t be free tomorrow afternoon
1	er no it s not that i can email it to to anon nametype m type name no no that doesn t matter
1	well i will have to go to anon type place tomorrow because i m fairly sure let me just look cos the box is here i ve found a few more pills because you know i make up those threes in a strip
1	mm
1	that i keep if i m trunc g trunc carrying about oh i may actually i may i could possibly even go over on friday
1	uhu
1	to collect them so
1	i i ve got i can go on thursday if you like
1	okay well are you you re coming back here anyway are you
1	oh yeah yeah
1	you re not having lunch with these people
1	no we don t usually have lunch
1	well if you
1	not not as sociable as you
1	if you did have lunch with them pause dur short you d be over in roughly the right area wouldn t you
1	no no i we d never have lunch trunc tog trunc
1	no no
1	never had lunch unclear together unclear
1	okay so you ll come back and have some lunch here will you
1	yeah
1	and then we can event desc sound of computer
1	decide whether it s
1	what was that
1	best to erm pause dur short i think it means an email message has come on my computer
1	oh right
1	erm we can decide how we play it
1	right okay
1	because
1	that s fine
1	er my timing for going over to anon type place is pharmacy dependent
1	yes okay and if i get spare time and the library s open i shoot across to the library pause dur short oh i ve gotta do erm try and do anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name s fairy lights as well
1	okay
1	i m very very close to throwing them in the bin now vocal desc laugh
1	i think that might be the most time time effective thing to do with them really
1	well i it s got personal now because i haven t been able to to suss the problem but i think it s either one of two things there s either an internal break in one of the wires in the control unit or it s a crack in the printed circuit board controller so what i think i m going to do i m gonna replace all the wires in the control unit one by one and then cos what happens is i get it working then as i start closing it up it stops working but if that happens i ll just say to them you know fine all the lights work alright or i can make all the lights work er but yes they re running off a four and a half volt battery you know or
1	mm
1	three triple a cells or something
1	are they putting them outside
1	er i i don t know they might oh yeah i promised i ve got i ve got a little cheap set i picked up at the pound shop i said i d let them use them at the erm anon type place christmas fair
1	which erm which er because i m needing to buy my secret santa present pause dur short and i netto had a pound lights for a pound
1	netto
1	netto the one that anon nametype f type name calls the dog and basket
1	oh right i know what you mean
1	yellow and black
1	we haven t got one of them in anon type place have we
1	no we haven t but anon nametype f type name s got one
1	oh right
1	cos it it it s owned by sainsbury and it s actually on the same site as sainsbury
1	right
1	which seems a bit strange really
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short anyway they had them for a pound but we didn t get round to going er well no er well i wasn t sure cos i ve done lights before
1	mm
1	but i do think they re a nice thing to pause dur short normally you can
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you can stick a few extra lights up somewhere can t you trunc any trunc anybody can
1	oh yeah yeah
1	i think erm
1	i still haven t made my giant christmas tree i was always gonna make mm
1	well let s not let s let s let s leave it for this year perhaps
1	christmas cards
1	yes christmas cards erm pause dur short so we re we re talking about tomorrow and we ve got basically please don t point at me i hate people pointing erm and it s obvious you re talking to me cos there s nobody else in the room pause dur short erm pause dur short tomorrow we ve got tomorrow you re going out to your whatever it is and we re working out we re doing something in the afternoon so that s alright
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short friday i think you re free on friday so
1	mm
1	we could do it on friday if not
1	mm
1	erm or if it seemed a i could go over to anon type place and then we could go over together and pick things up erm have you insulated the tap at erm
1	no isolated
1	insulated is the word the application of
1	wrapped it with bubble wrap no i haven t
1	in in the old days it used to be the old sock
1	no i haven t
1	father was very keen on the old sock approach
1	yeah
1	but actually erm bubble wrap is what i used last year
1	no unclear
1	okay ah er we need to take some with us although there s probably gonna be some there erm
1	really
1	and there might even be the thing i used last year if had to unclear blame my unclear how how it got pulled off erm pause dur short okay erm you you mentioned christmas cards did you see that i ve got the first christmas card of the year arrived
1	oh was that yeah i guessed it might be
1	the little square one
1	yeah
1	it s from anon nametype m type name who if he s in the country and he often goes to erm vietnam or somewhere at christmas cos he has vietnamese in his in his blood
1	mm
1	erm i think with his sister they both sometimes go over erm pause dur short but that that s arrived he always seems to like posting them on the thirtieth of november which he may have done and he d trunc ma trunc and i always think i d really like to have my cards out as early as his but i m not competing this year because i know i can t erm what pause dur short what thoughts have you had about christmas cards
1	no just none i thought i d just panic for a bit trunc ye trunc
1	okay i maybe we ll put some thought into that tomorrow morning
1	uhu
1	because alongside the christmas card is what we say in a letter and i need to be a little bit thoughtful about what i m putting in
1	oh i think i might leave that to you i ll i ll do some late night tonight i ll do some looking around see if i can find find a picture
1	so you re thinking about making some in some way
1	well that s a possibility yeah but
1	uhu
1	it that depends on it depends on a lot of things it depends on the picture it depends on could i get some half decent paper which i probably can t anyway
1	you ll probably only get packs of ten or something
1	well it s either packs of ten or a ream you know pause dur short but erm
1	if you can get anything trunc dece trunc what s a ream
1	five hundred sheets
1	one pack
1	five hundred sheets
1	five five packs
1	no five hundred individual sheets in a
1	yeah
1	ream
1	how many trunc d trunc how many do you get in pause dur short a photocopying pack
1	a ream
1	we normally buy possibly up to a hundred and fifty
1	mm
1	so if you could get good paper
1	yeah well it ll be worthwhile buying a ream to keep us going for a couple of years
1	if you think there might be two times your you want to do it again even if it s not next year it s worth thinking about if you could get something good
1	i haven t seen it i i ll it s worth maybe on friday i ll have a stroll around anon type place cos there aren t that number of places there s staples rymans
1	i don t
1	and that s oh paperchase i suppose but their stuff tends to be very expensive
1	well it tends to be in in small packets
1	yeah
1	but i d do web research rather than walk round anon type place
1	mm
1	then if anybody does have anything decent you can go and have a look at it
1	yeah i suppose so
1	erm
1	so do i look for ornamental paper or something
1	well just look up er everybody you know in anon type place paperchase the other ones you mentioned and just see what they sell
1	mm
1	erm or or i don t know if there s some more wholesale paper sort of place
1	i could actually i could go and see my mates at anon type place road couldn t i the printers i use
1	could ask the printers about it
1	yeah that s an idea cos they can get paper at ultra short notice as well
1	yeah
1	they literally phoning up and have it delivered the next day
1	we may not need that much but i mean
1	well we unclear don t unclear have a minimum of a ream i m sure
1	well yes pause dur short but
1	yeah but they re quite friendly and quite helpful i ve put a lot of work their way
1	it s worth thinking er it s worth thinking about i think even if
1	yes
1	you don t do it
1	that s a good idea actually
1	okay so it looks as though you ll be i bought some cards cos i always send some of
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	some individual cards and the first individual card i might be writing is one to anon nametype f type name
1	uhu
1	that we can take over if we go and see her sometime in the next few days with a poinsettia
1	uhu
1	can you think of any reason why it wouldn t be good to take her a poinsettia yet
1	well have we done it before
1	yes which sort of traditional
1	it sounds sounds fairly boring
1	it s sort of traditional
1	oh right okay
1	well er she s got a lovely home and
1	she does have a lovely
1	she trunc de trunc she does tend to decorate it for christmas whether she will as much this year i wanted to get it early so she could enjoy it before christmas
1	oh
1	well they you know
1	okay
1	anon nametype m type name said well i bought one of those already but the one i bought died so it was quite nice you brought me another one
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but she s got you know different rooms and
1	yeah
1	you know she s well not different rooms but
1	and a cat does the cat eat poinsettia
1	i don t know i imagine if if we take it round you would like to come
1	oh yes i d like to unclear play with the cat unclear
1	only anon nametype f type name and i it s nice it s a shame that anon nametype f type name wasn t able to visit when we were down last time cos we had it on a long list of things we might do because i do feel a little bit bad that we didn t talk to anon nametype f type name individually
1	vocal desc cough
1	about coming to the funeral
1	uhu
1	cos she s not our friend more than anon nametype f type name s friend but as things turned out erm it i i do feel i wish i d checked in with her
1	mm
1	but i didn t and
1	i i i wouldn t have thought of doing it so
1	mm cos you know i although you know it s it s difficult because er perhaps perhaps anon nametype f type name ought to take the lead on her friends
1	mm
1	but there was a bit of a slip up over some relatives
1	mm
1	which could have been a misunderstanding on my part perhaps but i suspect it was on a list of things that anon nametype f type name was going to do but erm and she may not have done well it appeared she didn t do erm pause dur short but anyway er i don t know anon nametype f type name may not have wanted to come to the funeral i don t know
1	i don t think she knew anon nametype m type name particularly well
1	no but just
1	she d met him or you think she might liked to have come out in solidarity with anon nametype f type name sort of thing
1	well only that she has been involved in the family for fifty or more years
1	oh yes that s true isn t it indirectly via anon nametype f type name as well yeah
1	it s via anon nametype f type name
1	yeah yeah
1	so
1	yeah
1	i don t know when somebody in the family dies
1	yeah
1	do you go i don t know if you re a longstanding family friend
1	i think typically you do yeah
1	but you would if it was in anon type place would you necessarily
1	if it was local local you certainly
1	yeah
1	you certainly would go but trunc bei trunc that much further away makes it makes it a bit more difficult i dunno
1	i don t know anyway we can t do anything about that but
1	no no water under the bridge
1	i feel i d still like to maintain contact with anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	and in that she sent you a card
1	mm
1	admittedly it was you a card rather than me a card but it looks as though she s keen to keep
1	mm
1	a card going obviously it was your birthday
1	it s was my birthday so she can hardly send you a card you prawn is she vocal desc laugh
1	no but you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i mean anon nametype f type name sent you a card but i wouldn t expect she d send me one
1	mm
1	for example
1	mm
1	erm and just because you know she s done it to you it doesn t mean
1	well whatever
1	she wants to do it for me but anyway i think one if we go early it will also set what we re doing
1	trunc ye trunc right i need to put the bin out and do the washing up erm
1	okay well i m i will assist i can do the washing up or i could probably
1	oh oh
1	i could do the drying up with the use
1	do you wanna put the bin out
1	no won t do the
1	no
1	put trunc th trunc put the bin out
1	no right
1	i trunc ye trunc and we were going to do the servicing of the unclear troja unclear this afternoon
1	the servicing
1	you said you would service it
1	oh right okay unclear just give it a brush unclear
1	you said when i come back
1	i ll give a brush with the scrubbing brush
1	no not not a clean er it has the servicing instruction for
1	oh
1	check the brakes and things
1	oh right oh i didn t know about that
1	well on that instruction leaflet it s very thorough
1	oh right okay
1	erm
1	does it need re greasing like like six thousand kilometres
1	no it s the one that ends with you need it if you want it disinfected it had to be done by a professional
1	oh you read that part out for me but you didn t read out the
1	trunc w trunc
1	servicing this
1	the the only thing is that erm it is a little bit stiff to
1	which where
1	when you unclip it and when you try and
1	to open it out you mean
1	trunc y trunc you can open it out when you try and close it you have to almost yank the
1	right just
1	handle up
1	it just sounds to me it s not been used for a long time
1	well i d just like you to check it cos i don t want to be pulling it inappropriately
1	yes you can
1	i did
1	tend to rip door handles off and things can t you or unclear
1	i did check to make sure that i was erm i understood the mechanism
1	uhu
1	but i just wondered whether if it hadn t been used for a long time although i don t know quite i don t quite understand that er but it does look a bit dusty in places that it just might need lubricating a little or something
1	mm i won t do that this evening but i will
1	no
1	i ll dust it over
1	no no no you shouldn t do any more cos you ve done enough with that erm pause dur short with that door
1	mm
1	but
1	bit of a pain that actually
1	yeah but it does need to go back on the list of things that to do because i would like it looked at
1	uhu
1	i d also like your opinion on when or trunc m trunc you know i ve got three small candle lights they re not candles as in real flames you just put a battery and they light up
1	oh yeah i know yeah
1	one of them doesn t anymore but i think i i can t remember if it even came they may not trunc m trunc the batteries may have been separate oh the batteries would have been in place probably one of those pieces of plastic you pull out
1	that you pull out yeah
1	but there s a little screw and i think you might be able to get the battery out
1	oh well that s fairly simple
1	and i would like you to show me if that is the case
1	yeah
1	cos you i and we may er even have some batteries to fit on your big board
1	it might might be another one of this cr s which i the ones i got for my car key
1	oh right
1	cos i bought eight of those in one go from the pound shop
1	well if you ve got a spare one of those then that would be
1	got a spare seven actually
1	yes erm well one of the others might need a go soon but
1	mm
1	if if if you ve got a small screwdriver i d like i think
1	i have many small screwdrivers
1	i think it s erm something i could do myself
1	oh
1	but i need instruction
1	oh
1	i didn t haven t got on very well with the watch battery thing yet but i think i should be able to do that
1	i ve gotta do anon nametype m type name s watch he s given me a watch to put back in unfortunately it s a it s a very peculiar strap cos normally i pin the bracelet off
1	mm
1	so you ve got good access to the back but it s a funny one if you oh i don t really see it at aldi once they did a watch repair kit
1	mm
1	which was something silly like three pound fifty or something like that and i wish i d bought one now because it had three or four it had an adjustable spanner a pin a push pin and for for just the odd funny little tools you need
1	mm
1	which might have been quite useful pause dur short mm i might even look at the web see if there s one on the web
1	might be it s always possible
1	or i ll put it on my christmas card list you never know
1	yeah i don t know well not on your christmas card list cos you re not gonna send them a christmas card but you might put it on your
1	amazon wish list
1	christmas present list
1	yeah
1	erm
1	oh damn i must phone anon nametype m type name up pause dur short i just remembered
1	i am really at a loss as to what to put on my christmas card list er oh you ve got me saying it now my amazon wish list
1	i trunc f trunc er books is yours a good thing i think
1	i well i don t i trunc d trunc i mean i m not getting round to reading
1	neither am i
1	books you know if i i m not going to want to just get them and throw them away
1	no have you seen any dvds you want films
1	well
1	cos there were a few you you you ve acquired a few that you particularly wanted haven t you are there any more that you could put on
1	well if unless they re trunc rea trunc
1	cos dvds are easy to get you know
1	unless some really special one i d rather borrow them to be honest
1	okay fine
1	because erm i don t really want to keep them
1	well the other issue is
1	you see
1	if you don t choose something something will be imposed upon you vocal desc laugh
1	well i i did choose things last year and i still was given something
1	well i think they ve bought that much earlier on with you in mind you know
1	well maybe
1	yeah yeah they had bought it
1	no they said no they said they d bought it and they and they hadn t quite decided who to give it to
1	mm
1	and they
1	they bought it cos they liked it
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	erm would it be if i mean the thing that i might like is a smartphone
1	mm
1	i mean in a way it would be nice
1	mm
1	it would suit my purposes more
1	mm
1	if they could give you a small contribution
1	mm
1	towards my smartphone
1	mm yeah think it would cost you about sixty quid for unclear wire three thousand unclear trunc y trunc
1	cos i mean they
1	which is quite good
1	they give awfully generous presents and if there are things that you want it s trunc int trunc but i i mean i d sort of been putting things on a wish list at the moment unless i m get great inspiration
1	mm
1	i mean i don t i mean i m i my my life is quite you know i ve got i would have needed an mp player
1	well we sorted that
1	but i needed to get one and that s quite a big thing to put on even so isn t it
1	yeah
1	erm
1	yeah i can have a word with the two of them they re quite they re quite amenable to suggestion they ll much rather give you something you want
1	well it just seems like that would be something i d i d like
1	yeah
1	i mean i d rather they didn t buy me a present anyway to be honest
1	well you can t avoid that i m afraid they re like that mm
1	erm pause dur short well i i i could trunc poss trunc i mean if they want to buy me something i could try and put some very small things on there
1	mm
1	do you think that would be helpful
1	yeah pause dur short yeah we ve got a present i think we ve got a present from anon nametype f type name s folks at their house
1	tea or jam
1	i don t see the point of that but she s very erm pause dur short oh i think she s she feels i look after anon nametype f type name you know so i think cos i see anon nametype f type name quite a lot quite often
1	mm
1	i think she and i think the way i looked after when she was very ill when she was
1	mm
1	she s got unclear
1	so do you think we better make a start on this washing up
1	no i ll make a start on taking the bin out
1	oh bin out and then washing up
1	yeah
1	have you had something for supper
1	yeah
1	oh i trunc did n trunc missed that happening
1	you were too busy watching television

1	and it was it s me pause dur short er looking at pause dur short a a a nice cup of coffee pause dur short and this this is in anon type place airport pause dur short and it was the last drink pause dur short to use up the trunc c trunc trunc l trunc local currency pause dur short and erm pause dur short and you notice there are pause dur short er there are two two erm pause dur short vocal desc laugh when it when it when when it vocal desc laugh it s when the camera behaves itself pause dur short erm pause dur short erm and you notice there s two straws and a stirrer pause dur short and this turned out to be the most expensive cup of coffee er i ve ever paid for pause dur short it was er a ordinary cup of coffee i would say and it was six pounds for a cup of coffee
1	gosh
1	and i don t think anywhere possibly in china was that much pause dur short most cups of coffee in china were probably around erm pause dur short vocal desc misc the erm trunc w trunc what they are in this country about pause dur short two and a trunc ha trunc to two pound fifty three pounds but this was pause dur short we only had so much currency left and we thought we d have two cups of coffee pause dur short but in the end vocal desc laugh everyone erm pause dur short trunc o trunc on our on our in our group pause dur short trunc t trunc decided that this was just six pounds was just too much so everyone asked vocal desc laugh for a straw two straws pause dur short to to have our er to have the coffee anyway that it s just a it s a little bit of trunc f trunc of fun there pause dur short erm but if i go to the trunc begi trunc the trunc f trunc the first first place we went to pause dur short which was erm we arrived in beijing er at the end of september the weather was pause dur short very very kind to us actually because beijing can be very erm vocal desc misc er they have a lot of pollution and er but the two two to three days we were there it was erm pause dur short trunc a trunc as far as one could tell it was er trunc s trunc trunc no trunc well it s nice and sunny you could walk around it was lovely and warm pause dur short and er and it was really right quite you know quite pleasant erm pause dur short er place to to walk around but er trunc i trunc the the pollution pause dur short trunc ca trunc er we were told can get down to very it can be very very bad er trunc ha trunc trunc h trunc bad levels of pollution so people are have to wear masks and that sort of thing but we didn t pause dur short while we were there we didn t trunc no trunc we didn t see that pause dur short erm pause dur short we did hear that when we got to shanghai at the end of our trip that in beijing that the the pollution had closed in and er the index we were told was over three hundred pause dur short er trunc i trunc trunc how trunc however they rate the pollution index but it was over three hundred the erm pause dur short er pause dur short and apparently london in comparison so someone was saying the pollution index in london pause dur short which some consider to be quite bad trunc w trunc was ten to fifteen
1	right
1	so so the the difference between beijing on a bad day and london is er is a is a different erm er you know different kind of vocal desc laugh er
1	category
1	category altogether really pause dur short anyway we were we went round erm er we went round erm pause dur short er pause dur short er beijing pause dur short erm on our trunc t trunc couple of days and we went through to what s called a summer palace and erm pause dur short trunc a trunc and this was er pause dur short the the the trunc th trunc one of the things that i hadn t fully appreciated erm when when we went until we went there just how much history there is in china i mean you they their history goes back erm thousands of years
1	mm mm
1	and it s just pause dur short mind blowing absolutely mind blowing so
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	it it it was a fascinating pause dur short er pause dur short and i don t think the chinese themselves actually have erm pause dur short er have appreciated just how historical their erm pause dur short er you know how much history they actually have and and and you probably know of erm it s was on the antiques roadshow the other day that because erm pause dur short trunc th trunc trunc they trunc they ve over the years they ve got rid of a lot of their antiques
1	mm
1	and the antiques are appearing in the antiques roadshow and various places all over the
1	mm
1	all over the world that the chinese now want to er repatriate as many antiques as possible
1	mm
1	erm and er and i think a lot of their trunc his trunc kind of old historical houses they pause dur short may have they may have trunc d trunc er discarded or trunc d trunc or just thrown away lots of really ancient erm pause dur short vocal desc misc er antiques and now they they they need to kind of refurnish er they ve realised now what a big draw
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	er er it is for tourists i m not sure if they still really think pause dur short erm you know that they have er a pause dur short i mean like trunc w trunc ourselves and the royal family erm is is a is is probably a a much closer feeling than a trunc chin trunc a normal an average chinese person to their emperors the emperors were you know a kinda long gone
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short type of thing whereas the the royal trunc fam trunc so so but anyway they are trying to erm pause dur short to erm er make a big thing of all their historical monuments now and of course they ve got the terracotta trunc v trunc er army as well terracotta warriors pause dur short major major thing erm but erm pause dur short vocal desc misc er yes the er er er trunc h trunc trunc ah trunc how trunc ah trunc how trunc s trunc how can er one say pause dur short their the mm
1	well well it s a bit like the national trust isn t it because the national trust erm get homes donated to them to the country
1	yeah
1	and then they have to then furnish them again and look for antiques and they buy a lot of antiques for things to go in the national trust so it s exactly the same thing but the trunc china trunc chinese are really needing things now i mean if if you ve got something tucked away in a cupboard or in the attic or
1	mm
1	aunt flo s old bowl or something that nobody thought was any great value
1	yeah
1	but to the chinese it can be worth a huge amount of pause dur short it is worth a huge amount of money to them to get it back
1	yeah it it it trunc c trunc it trunc c trunc it could be worth a
1	mm
1	an awful lot of money and erm pause dur short erm and and it does depend on the erm pause dur short the on the antiques roadshow they were saying it depends on what you know like all antiques it depends what is erm popular at any one time so the erm the tang dynasty was the er the the emperor then he really encouraged arts and culture and there was a period of er er prolonged erm vocal desc misc stability in the country and that gave rise to lots of erm arts and crafts which have erm we went into a couple of really really top notch er museums where the er and art galleries where they ve got all these a lot of these artefacts going back to vocal desc misc er six thousand years bc it s an absolutely
1	mm
1	absolutely phenomenal er the the art and the the skill er because they didn t have all the modern equipment that we have today so they er you could you could see what sort of skills they had
1	mm
1	trunc th trunc oh you know six thousand years ago it was it was it was quite quite erm quite something
1	mm pause dur short and of course chinese medicine is the oldest and most ancient form of medicine in the world
1	yes yes indeed unclear and er unclear
1	and when people rubbish acupuncture and that sort of erm thing
1	yeah
1	really erm they don t really know what they re talking about because that that s been practised for for many years and if it s practised properly it has a beneficial result
1	mm pause dur short mm yeah yeah yeah
1	and a lot of erm chinese medicine all the herbs and that sort of thing they re the origins in a lot of proprietary medicines today
1	mm mm
1	and that s worth erm thinking about
1	yeah i i yeah i think there was an trunc a trunc there we had a lot trunc in trunc trunc ge trunc we were given a lot of information actually we were trunc e trunc it was very very good tour
1	mm
1	but i i think erm what we didn t erm er what what could ve been carried on a separate talk was pause dur short the medicine side
1	yes
1	trunc wi trunc er that was er and er the other thing was erm i felt that the trunc s trunc that the trunc s trunc do and they do an awful lot of silk printing pause dur short so
1	oh yes
1	that that would ve been er or silk erm pause dur short er trunc s trunc silk print so that would ve been quite good if they d been able to give us a a talk about how trunc th trunc how they do all that and that would be quite good
1	yes pause dur short it would
1	er we had a a talk on feng shui erm and we had lots of talks about the history but the history is so
1	right
1	so vast that erm pause dur short erm but anyway trunc o trunc going back to what we what er our our tour we we we trunc s trunc are are we are we okay trunc o trunc unclear on time unclear
1	carry on pause dur short carry on
1	okay pause dur short erm we had erm vocal desc misc the we went round the summer palace and erm er trunc w trunc vocal desc laugh the other thing the few things that i hadn t appreciated one was just how much history there is in this in china and it it s such a big place pause dur short the other thing was i i i i er i should ve realised just how many people there are so vocal desc misc whereas you trunc no trunc normally go to places in in europe and you there ll be a place people from america japan etcetera pause dur short the the trunc maj trunc it seemed to me the majority of tourists in china were the chinese pause dur short so because it s one point three one point four billion the numbers of people
1	yes
1	there were huge numbers of people pause dur short that erm they erm er gosh look at that over there you see he s fallen into the water he s come right back up again gosh that s good
1	unclear yeah unclear pause dur short well just for the tape we re sitting on the anon type place in anon type place and there s a party of five canoeists erm trying to go over the anon type place erm while we re recording this erm pause dur short this talk today erm and the vocal desc laugh the interesting thing is that you may hear and we re in a car erm but you may hear some erm water sounds in the background and so pause dur short while we re talking about china we re also looking at canoeists trying to get up the weir
1	and and they re going trunc u trunc trying to go up the weir and some of them are going up and then pause dur short they re completely going under the water and then flipping up again which is quite
1	yeah
1	quite remarkable
1	it is
1	how how they re quite skilful they re holding holding their obviously holding their breaths trunc f trunc and and erm pause dur short and unclear righting unclear themselves very quickly pause dur short erm
1	yeah pause dur short they re all erm they re actually sort of pause dur short as you can see they re they re actually really covered in these little canoes aren t they
1	well not pause dur short yeah
1	they ve got these sort of like trunc tourniq trunc what do you what do you call them they re like canvas covers that they fit round their body so that they trunc f trunc
1	mm
1	the actual canoe is attached to their waists
1	yeah yeah
1	which is erm really interesting
1	yeah they re they re very i don t think they ll i don t think they ve got any hope of going up that weir
1	unclear they trunc s trunc unclear
1	but maybe what they re trying to do is to practise pause dur short erm
1	turning on a wave
1	trunc t trunc trunc t trunc trunc tur trunc turning yes turning on a wave because pause dur short trunc u trunc trunc u trunc trunc u trunc erm you you yeah you ve gotta be able to cope with pause dur short erm pause dur short i ve done a little bit of white water rafting and
1	oh
1	you you have to you have to cope with the erm the currents and the erm pause dur short and also getting wet and then pause dur short recovering sort of thing
1	anyway well shall we go back to china
1	mm yeah yeah indeed yeah so so er just so we we trunc we trunc so first couple of days or so we ve first day we went to erm pause dur short fact we arrived erm pause dur short i think it was about pause dur short nine or ten o clock in the morning so
1	right
1	so so we trunc d trunc we couldn t go straight to our hotel so we we did erm erm pause dur short we trunc d trunc went to the summer palace the first day the first day we got there vocal desc laugh so we trunc str trunc straight away we went erm from the airport on our tour it was quite remarkable really
1	yes pause dur short did you
1	we had a we had a very good flight and
1	did you sleep at all on the flight
1	er yeah i had a trunc c trunc a fair fair er fairly good yeah so it was erm vocal desc misc yeah it s it s was trunc brit trunc it s er british airways flight and it was it wasn t bad it was erm yeah so it s and we er here are some photographs that you can see how crowded it is because most of these people here they re they re obviously people from all over the world but er there s an awful lot of er chinese people er going round and we our first kind of trunc in trunc instruction was if you see two lions like this
1	yeah
1	you ll see pause dur short er the pause dur short male lion on one side and there you ll see it see pause dur short and you ll see pause dur short yeah a male lion on the trunc r trunc pause dur short on that side pause dur short as on the left hand side and and then the female one is on the right and trunc l trunc you can tell the female one because she s got a a kind of baby lion er under her left or i think it s her left or right claw
1	right
1	and and and and the trunc w trunc the way that was sort of er interpreted was that erm pause dur short that the woman is always right you see
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh er that was trunc th trunc our our tour manager said that s a a modern twist on the er on a very vocal desc laugh probably on a very old theme of something
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short yeah
1	er but the i mean this looks better on the erm on a on a larger screen but the the the the er decoration and everything er on on some of these things
1	describe what we re looking at here
1	it s a it s a erm pause dur short well it s it s erm pause dur short it s trunc a trunc ancient i dunno erm
1	portico
1	yeah i i think when i say ancient it s a lot of what you see in china isn t it looks old but it may not be it may be pause dur short only in the last twenty thirty years vocal desc laugh it might or the last fifty years because they ve done such a lot of work erm er because they know history is such a a big draw to people erm and there s a lot of interest so they ve trunc r trunc trunc th trunc this might be very old but it might erm a trunc l trunc er er er the british i think this is the place pause dur short er or one of the places that when the british went to it er it might ve been beijing but they burnt a lot of er the the erm old buildings
1	oh dear
1	erm so the brits didn t have a a great erm pause dur short erm vocal desc laugh
1	sympathy
1	trunc sy trunc sympathy erm trunc th trunc there is a story that erm er erm er trunc i trunc i think it s a colonel or captain mccartney pause dur short did
1	right
1	er in the nineteenth century erm trunc f trunc there s a story that he went to do business with the chinese and the chinese at that time were starting so pause dur short erm oh well they d been quite a closed country because of the big
1	mm
1	land er big trunc m trunc trunc m trunc trunc m trunc range of mountains on the left hand side of the country
1	mm
1	but and they ve always been very kind of they ve always been quite warring kinda nation and they ve got had warlords and and that sort of thing and and very and they haven t been really interested to go outside but at one stage the emperor was thinking about doing more business with west to with europe and opening up and that s in the nineteenth century and then he had vocal desc laugh someone like mccartney this captain mccartney or colonel mccartney or whatever he from britain went along and erm and pause dur short he brought lots and lots of gifts erm so we were told for the emperor pause dur short and erm pause dur short and trunc th trunc that s not that was good you know diplomatic thing to do
1	mm
1	but pause dur short what he wouldn t do he said he would not bow to the emperor
1	uhu
1	he said he would only bow to his her majesty or his trunc ma trunc her majesty the queen
1	mm
1	he you know he will never bow to anyone else pause dur short and because of that even though he brought loads and loads of presents the emperor erm pause dur short took erm pause dur short took a complete erm
1	umbrage
1	yeah umbrage and erm wouldn t do any business with with the trunc br trunc british and it it got very very difficult it led to pause dur short erm britain pause dur short er it s er it s the it s the it s called the opium wars
1	mm mm
1	where erm er as i believe the erm britons were er british were ended up profiteering from er selling er opium to the chinese creating a lot of erm drug erm drug dens in china
1	mm
1	er and and profiteering on on on that basis
1	mm mm
1	until erm and trunc th trunc that sort of put vocal desc laugh put erm pause dur short put the er chinese off erm europe for a number of years and it s always probably been a bit suspicious ever since
1	mm pause dur short do do you remember that pause dur short mum went to a jumble sale once and bought an ivory erm pipe
1	yeah
1	and it was it was always kept in the marble slab drawer in the hallway do you remember that was years and years it was there with the gloves and what not
1	oh i do yes i do
1	and she would never take it out and put it on show because she d found out it was an opium pipe
1	oh
1	and it was for drugs and she was erm and we got and we got rid of it i can t remember pause dur short and you know that s one of the things that would be worth quite a lot of money now
1	i trunc th trunc i think it would
1	i bet you that was trunc i trunc you know we got rid of it i can t remember why
1	mm
1	erm she hung onto it for ages and ages
1	mm
1	erm and er yes erm that s one of the things you know if you took it to an antiques roadshow
1	mm mm
1	it was very old then
1	yeah
1	so it it may have been worth a huge amount of money but we didn t erm
1	no don t know
1	yeah she she trunc w trunc we just got rid of it i i can t remember my things you do get rid of things when erm
1	mm
1	well it it was erm trunc i trunc no one was ever going to display it and it was definitely surplus to requirements so we didn t use it
1	mm
1	anyway so china again
1	so china so erm pause dur short so anyway erm pause dur short so trunc lot trunc lots of pagodas erm and sort of quite attractive sort of trunc loa trunc
1	tower
1	er towers erm erm and pause dur short erm
1	trunc wi trunc
1	rooms which the the the emperor erm and his er family er lived and i i think they also have oh there s the female lion
1	right
1	with the cub under her left claw
1	right
1	er we went into anon type place the last few days and and erm they have the lions round the wrong way
1	oh did they
1	trunc n trunc yes yes so we we we should ve pointed it out to them but erm very decorative and erm pause dur short er actually it s quite hot in here shall i er trunc ca trunc can i take my coat off
1	yes you can
1	er unclear yeah yeah yeah i do unclear
1	erm we ll keep trunc tal trunc i ll keep talking you take your coat off
1	yes yes yes pause dur short yeah yeah i ll just
1	erm pause dur short anon nametype m type name s opening the door of the car now and he s talking his coat off erm while i m watching these canoeists who are really going mad over these rapids out here erm the sun s come out and the sky is erm the sky is a sort of grey colour we re just closing the door of the car then and erm pause dur short it is warm but we ve got to keep the trunc b trunc the doors and windows closed because er of the trunc can trunc trunc u trunc because of the erm sounds of the rapids out here
1	mm
1	and the anon type place erm now we we re going to to back to anon nametype m type name talking about china so i ll just pass this over to you pause dur short pop that there alright
1	so erm we went round the summer palace which was trunc v trunc very interesting lots of erm but it it was so full of people but it was still very interesting erm pause dur short and er very artistic er sort of chinese erm bridges erm pagodas pause dur short and erm
1	beautiful lantern there
1	yeah yeah lanterns pause dur short and the special walkway that s it was a lot of these things were designed for for pause dur short erm the emperor and he trunc ha trunc er most of them had er a load of concubines and erm it was quite a we didn t see any concubines while we were there
1	i always think concubines it always makes me think of porcupines
1	vocal desc laugh yes yes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	unclear this is true this is true unclear pause dur short so erm then what did we do then er let s have a look pause dur short erm
1	what was your hotel like
1	hotel erm it was quite pleasant it was er a very central trunc hot trunc er hotel and erm there were er two or three weddings going on there at the same time it s quite quite it had a convention centre right next door and erm and they erm
1	and the people who were getting married were they all chinese
1	yeah yes all chinese very pause dur short erm we we erm we didn t see very erm the chinese seemed to be quite erm pause dur short sort of er kind of quite affluent er chinese that we saw erm and er but but there are there s a big erm apparently a big dichotomy of er or split between the chinese who live in the cities who probably compose pause dur short i dunno twenty to thirty percent of the population
1	yeah
1	and the the poor peasant farmer who erm comprises the most population so so the chinese government whatever you trunc s trunc you know dispute about their erm pause dur short their motives and everything and pause dur short erm they have a a a major economic problem at the moment between the the people who ve got erm pause dur short er a more or more than you know are trunc v trunc pretty erm affluent erm group of people who getting well educated and all that sort of thing and then you ve got the the sort of peasant farmers who who are just scraping a living it s it s a real erm they have got a real big problem so erm just as sort of an aside on that they trunc h trunc obviously pause dur short vocal desc misc erm the trunc s trunc communist party er who trunc o trunc run china erm but you know you just think trunc i trunc that nowhere else on earth trunc ha trunc is there a government er as far as i m aware that have to control er as much as twenty percent of the pause dur short the er population of the world
1	right
1	so er they have er so when it comes to erm
1	yeah pause dur short quite a thought isn t it
1	it it is it is quite a thought and it and when they when you think that erm they they re not very good on their human rights record is is is not very good at all but then erm their the history of china trunc ha trunc er as it comes over to me is that it s been pretty brutal erm er the you know trunc wi trunc er over the thousands of years that they ve been erm in existence people er people ve been executed and erm people there ve been you know all kinds of wars and everything like that
1	vocal desc misc mm
1	which we in europe have never heard of er er er and and and it s been really really brutal and
1	no no
1	erm if trunc s trunc you disagreed with anyone in china er the emperor would you know literally er vocal desc laugh it seems to me have er his head would come off or something like that
1	right
1	so so it you know and i think erm it it might be in the erm er chinese er psyche trunc psych trunc er psyche that er that a erm the er pause dur short the the that that s what if there s any unrest that that they ll they deal with people very very harshly erm so erm er we we erm i don t know if you saw on the news the other night er just when we got back vocal desc misc on the bbc news erm pause dur short there was a trunc pict trunc there was a trunc f trunc a film on erm the bbc about president xi visiting
1	mm
1	er unclear over unclear
1	yes yes
1	and then they had a picture of this big church that had been erm where the people of this local i dunno town had grouped gathered together and built a big church erm erm a christian church
1	right
1	erm and there was pictures of the congregation erm pause dur short all trunc h trunc saying their prayers and everything like that
1	mm
1	and and and on one side the chinese are are being very supportive of erm different religions and different groups
1	yes pause dur short mm mm
1	but erm there was one chap pause dur short that attached to this church who was a bit outspoken and erm and so the next picture you see is that erm the erm pause dur short this er the pause dur short diggers moved in
1	oh no
1	and they they completely erm they
1	raised it to the ground did they
1	well they didn t raise it to the ground but they broke it so that the whole roof had collapsed everything had collapsed so it couldn t be used and and er so so the these chinese people are very erm pause dur short vocal desc sigh they they they re very distrustful of any anything that sort of trunc chal trunc could challenged the erm pause dur short the chinese pause dur short government s policies
1	yeah
1	erm so yeah so it was quite quite quite something
1	i mean what what would happen in our country if we we ve had a lot of trouble with erm pause dur short with people from erm other religions erm some fanatical preachers who preach
1	mm
1	hate and
1	mm
1	what would happen if we went and pulled down their pause dur short their erm places of worship
1	i know and the the things they trunc g trunc get away with in china erm are are are amazing er the things you wouldn t you wouldn t get away with it here erm their their planning laws i don t i think are vocal desc laugh non existent cos they if they er the er party the communist party say that s the way it should be then that s the way it should be erm
1	yeah we re very tolerant in this country i mean at the moment erm pause dur short we went to anon type place at the weekend and we were absolutely amazed we got on the tube and there wasn t one person on the tube who i would say was of british origin
1	mm
1	ie everyone was talking in a foreign language
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short you know trunc u trunc it didn t matter what what trunc col trunc what what colour they were they were all talking in a foreign language there were chinese there were romanians there were all sorts of eastern europeans erm and then people who are obviously foreign because they re a slightly different colour
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short but the whole of the the carriages in every tube that we we travelled in they were none of them trunc w trunc were what you could call originally typically english which makes one feel like an ethnic minority in your own country
1	mm
1	but there you go that s how the world is now erm but you know a lot of places wouldn t tolerate that i mean hungary doesn t tolerate it pause dur short erm and erm vocal desc misc but we do
1	mm
1	and in in a way erm trunc i trunc trunc i trunc our country can t take much more of this saturation from other countries erm
1	mm
1	because we re going to use lose our our language as it stands now is going to be lost completely it s gonna go erm because all these other languages coming in are going to completely change it
1	mm
1	erm so i just wanted to say that we did find it rather disconcerting
1	mm on the other hand you see in china that that if if if any group you know gets gets looks like it s getting the upper hand it it s it s suppressed pause dur short erm vigorously and erm but that trunc c trunc in you know history tells us that where groups are suppressed over long periods of time
1	oh yes
1	eventually pause dur short erm it it it could lead to an overthrow erm situation which erm which erm pause dur short one chap said one one guide said he said look we we might not we we pause dur short we are pause dur short most people a lot of people belong to the communist party but not everyone
1	yeah
1	but he said just look trunc a trunc think of it this way if china pause dur short ever pause dur short er gets out of control pause dur short and they have you have to think about who s going to feed one point four trunc mil trunc billion people pause dur short erm who s going to do that pause dur short you know and we ve got this immigrant crisis going on in europe but that s could be a tiny problem relative speaking if if china ever gets out of control so so it s in pause dur short western europe s interest to pause dur short if you like keep the state maintain the status quo in in china erm if they pause dur short can can do all the things like feed the people erm pause dur short trunc b trunc trunc prov trunc provide erm trunc ec trunc growth erm and keep the erm pause dur short er the er environmental issues under control then then you know vocal desc laugh you you you re you re trunc g trunc you re getting sort of like pause dur short six seven or eight out of ten you might not be getting you know ten out of ten but you re trunc get trunc
1	right
1	so so erm
1	i can see what you re saying i mean it would be an absolutely enormous problem and then
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	what would we do erm but then you know we re only a small country england and we re not responsible for the erm problems of all these
1	no
1	enormous countries that have got plenty of space they may not have the resources there to maintain people but they have plenty of space there for people to grow food surely and to but and to make pause dur short and to make a life
1	well
1	whereas we haven t got trunc hardl trunc
1	mm
1	we re tiny if you look at the globe and you look at england in relation to all these other places
1	mm
1	we re just tiny
1	mm
1	absolutely tiny so the fact that erm more and people are coming here and they re pause dur short erm diluting our erm
1	mm
1	our customs they re diluting our food pause dur short we ve we re all our restaurants are now serving we trunc n trunc trunc i trunc very very rarely can you go out and have pause dur short meat and two veg
1	mm
1	erm
1	mm yeah
1	it s always got to be something fancy it s gotta be something from india or it s gotta be from italy
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	erm or something you know erm
1	mm
1	german food is is erm pause dur short really pause dur short trunc n trunc quite plain verging on the erm pause dur short almost like the british food in a way erm pause dur short but you know pause dur short and also and people say erm the italian trunc di trunc diet s the best well actually pause dur short you know in england if you ll if you eat english food properly you re eating pause dur short you know vegetables and
1	mm
1	a lot of vegetables
1	mm mm
1	and in the old days nobody could afford very much meat
1	mm
1	so it was potatoes and and vegetables
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	and that s what people had and that s very healthy
1	mm mm pause dur short but but china i mean it s it s it s erm i i think i read that it s agricultural er because there s a huge mountain range and so it s got a lot of desert there there isn t trunc mu trunc lot of agricultural land so it s it s up to them to to develop their economy so they can buy in er food stuffs so they buy in dried milk en masse apparently new zealand since i ve been there er has changed considerably and they now instead of having lots of sheep in new zealand which they probably still have vocal desc laugh they also have vast dairy herds and lot of the dairy milk is converted into dry milk powder which is then shipped to china
1	right
1	and so erm pause dur short vocal desc misc er so that that s trunc th trunc you know some of these so the knock on effect is if you can t make it yourself you ve got to buy it in
1	trunc b trunc buy it in
1	yeah
1	and by converting it into erm powder powdered milk pause dur short erm it keeps much better and it s easier to export isn t it
1	yeah pause dur short yeah yeah it is
1	erm
1	but just trunc g trunc er on our
1	let s have a look at that describe that photograph to me
1	well one of the things that really hit me and erm i don t know hit hit other people but the the number of tall buildings er er that that have been built because people are flooding into into the big cities erm you ve got a city such as erm pause dur short erm a small city is three million
1	right
1	erm beijing i think is around twenty five trunc m trunc million and shanghai is about pause dur short twenty eight million or something like that
1	right
1	something it s it s you know vocal desc laugh it s but so they haven t got places for people to live erm in a conventional way like we have round say anon type place so they ve built these massive massive and large numbers of high rise er apartments so one guy said in er trunc s trunc told us on on er at one stage he he lives with his wife and his erm erm er pause dur short er one one daughter because of course they had the one baby rule
1	yeah
1	so they they they lived three they live on the forty seventh floor of
1	good lord
1	of a building but you see in shanghai they trunc anyth trunc anything if you say anything over eighteen floors pause dur short is a high rise building
1	yeah
1	they ve got six thousand of those
1	right
1	so you you if you just imagine vocal desc laugh and they re trunc clo trunc quite close to it actually if you looked around anon type place and you had and er some of these places go up a hundred floors
1	yeah
1	er or more er yeah and trunc th trunc they you you trunc j trunc you just it s just erm amazing i mean this is just some of the construction going on in beijing at the moment sort of
1	oh yes i can see
1	you can just see er pause dur short erm pause dur short some of them erm pause dur short erm no oh this is er sorry er trunc thi trunc this is on our first day and this is anon type place where the
1	yeah the student riots
1	er the the trunc y trunc trunc stu trunc student riots were and erm and what you see is lots of it was actually quite it was a beautiful day and it was a a very pleasant day it s it s difficult to believe that there were riots here erm pause dur short but these were erm pause dur short all all constructed on anon type place
1	trunc w trunc where so we ve been looking at pillars of flowers is that right
1	er yeah there s trunc f trunc pillars of flowers all the way round here erm that s our group there erm that s one of the famous monuments showing er from the communist era
1	right
1	erm erm pause dur short and erm and they have loads of trunc flan trunc plants all the way round and when when this this was a common theme in trunc ch trunc in lots of places we went er where we see flowers in in britain if you saw lots of flowers you d think of flower beds
1	yeah
1	but in china most of the flowers are in flower pots
1	oh are they
1	so so you have this great big square where where the trunc dem trunc you know they have the the march past
1	mm
1	of the er er military
1	mm
1	and you also you know and and the there there there are some very ornate let me see if i can find oh yes that one see that one
1	oh it s beautiful isn t it
1	isn t it yeah and you ve got that and then you ve got all the flowers all the way round and they re all pots so the idea of course is that you know one day you can have that and then if there happens to be a big erm a big
1	festival
1	a bigger festival a big event move all those to one side and rearrange them
1	yeah and so trunc u trunc how what would they be made of cos we were looking at flowers in an absolutely enormous pot about as tall as
1	yeah
1	or half as tall as nelson s column so if you re looking at that and the flowers in there are enormous did you find out what they were made of
1	i vocal desc laugh i don t know no but the the the flowers round the base were all you know erm
1	proper flowers yeah
1	proper flowers
1	yeah
1	the ones up there i pause dur short suppose they could be silk pause dur short er
1	yeah silk or paper couldn t they
1	or paper yeah yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short er yeah it s trunc v trunc it was very for how high very ornate
1	it s beautiful
1	yeah yeah and and then they had erm pause dur short er some very sort of big statues and er as you can see the pause dur short the length and breadth of the square there pause dur short er there s another picture of it there it s trunc un trunc it s quite trunc ama trunc amazing how vocal desc laugh how they did this it s a
1	yeah
1	it s it s quite quite something oh it s pause dur short er pause dur short er there we ve got pause dur short various statues erm pause dur short see chairman mao just put it in trunc perspec trunc trunc pec trunc perspective he ruled for about twenty five years pause dur short or erm and till about nineteen seventy pause dur short five seventy six
1	mm
1	i think he died in seventy six and then the chap who succeeded him pause dur short and under his under trunc hi trunc everyone thinks of chairman mao as being pause dur short er a father figure
1	yes
1	vocal desc misc but that pause dur short what trunc chair trunc what mao or his advisers did was to say erm they said all these teachers and all the er lecturers and everything like that should go to work on the fields go back to fundamentals
1	oh right yeah
1	and so that s what he did and he he erm pause dur short vocal desc laugh so what what trunc w trunc trunc w trunc the the the net effect of that was that erm he just put everyone to work in the fields and on a kinda cooperative type basis vocal desc misc but in the early sixties it had such a a detrimental impact that er three three million people died as a result of hunger and starvation
1	oh right
1	and er and normally in any government that would ve been a er the government would ve been toppled erm but he erm he er pause dur short he managed to continue erm but when he went the next his successors have all erm er put a lot more emphasis on education
1	mm mm
1	and making sure people were technically qualified and all that stuff
1	mm mm
1	and have have used that as as one of the
1	unclear mm unclear
1	sorry vocal desc laugh
1	alright we just dropped the tape recorder but that s alright pop it there
1	vocal desc laugh alright erm er but er trunc th trunc the the erm vocal desc misc the er er the the people who came after him realised of that of course that they the the the the economy needed to be needed to grow to sustain the number of people that were in china so ever since er mao s time er the there s been much more trunc em trunc emphasis on the economy and education and erm and now they re saying doctors and teachers pause dur short have got pause dur short erm guaranteed or you know er will have guaranteed pensions at the end of their
1	mm
1	erm employment er when they retire whereas that was never the case before vocal desc laugh
1	no no
1	so this is the first time for that
1	mm mm
1	and there s a trunc l trunc erm but the whole thing is to get the kind of pause dur short everything moving and er certainly you what you do see is all these factories churning out er loads of products for
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short er western europe and erm
1	i mean they re allowed to have two children now as well aren t they just recently that that rule has been changed
1	yes pause dur short well it it yeah it needs to change because erm pause dur short er pause dur short because they need a younger trunc work trunc trunc u trunc trunc w trunc they need more people for the workforce but also pause dur short traditionally what used to happen erm pause dur short was that erm pause dur short as you had a er an extended family the the youngsters used to look after their parents or grandparents
1	mm pause dur short right
1	er but you might ve seen on the news the other night that because vocal desc laugh erm this is a real paradox because people are living longer pause dur short erm pause dur short you you you would see the other night on tv you saw er the the small baby her mother pause dur short her the trunc m trunc the grandmother pause dur short but also the great grandparents
1	right
1	so people are living longer pause dur short but you ve got a big chain you ve got one little girl
1	who s got to look after all of them
1	all of them yes
1	crikey
1	so so the the impact of that pause dur short is is is is is quite is really vocal desc laugh it it s not just that they need a bigger workforce
1	no
1	but they need pause dur short more people to look after the old people
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	it s it s really it s really bizarre
1	i mean in the days of chairman chairman mao if he sent everybody out to a cooperative to work trunc i trunc i e college lecturers doctors dentists whatever
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	he sent them all off to a cooperative to work they must ve had a terrific sort of brain drain
1	mm
1	within the central nucleus of pause dur short cities and towns and who trained the people
1	yeah absolutely
1	so they were well they were lacking in in trunc l trunc leadership and training in those areas
1	who is who pause dur short it was a lose lose situation
1	yeah yeah
1	that s er that s another trunc pic trunc
1	that s another one of those huge trunc flow trunc
1	yeah yeah
1	ceramic flower baskets
1	you see pause dur short and you can see all the flowers pause dur short trunc m trunc it s amazing really
1	oh right
1	yeah look at that see pause dur short and they re all separate pots
1	yeah
1	so
1	well that must be a very economical way of doing it
1	yeah
1	because erm in in anon type place pause dur short around the place every season they pull out all the ones and throw them away
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	but if they pause dur short keep them in pots
1	mm
1	and watered and fertilised they can bring them out next year can t they
1	mm mm mm pause dur short vocal desc misc this is a trunc f trunc a famous building because if you ve ever seen pictures of chairman mao he used to stand at the top there pause dur short to to survey all the erm pause dur short the troops and the march past the red army
1	what s the name of that place can you remember
1	er it s the forbidden city
1	right
1	erm i think is the is the place there pause dur short and this is we we re here we re going into the forbidden city pause dur short erm and it s vocal desc laugh full lots of full of tourists pause dur short erm pause dur short but pause dur short but this is where erm why was it forbidden er and erm it was where the emperor lived until the last emperor lived here until about nineteen twenty
1	right
1	where the last emperor was pause dur short er what was the full trunc s trunc story about that he was pause dur short he was told pause dur short basically i think people had enough of the emperor of er
1	mm
1	of being being governed by an emperor
1	mm
1	who was so detached from the people erm that he was he was kinda given the boot pause dur short and he went to pause dur short work at er trunc a trunc be erm pause dur short a kind of emperor
1	mm
1	er for the deadly rivals the biggest rivals to china japan
1	mm pause dur short right
1	japan is pause dur short vocal desc laugh er pause dur short japan to chinese is probably a bit like pause dur short erm or certainly was in the past er like the nazis were to erm to pause dur short to the british erm absolutely sort of kinda i i think they re still vocal desc laugh still er not very comfortable existence erm but erm pause dur short er but anyway he the the trunc ch trunc emperor went to work for for trunc j trunc for in about nineteen twenties went trunc f trunc to work for trunc j trunc japan which was not a good idea
1	right
1	and then he came back and erm and trunc h trunc he was a gardener
1	right
1	he they made him into a gardener and he wrote a
1	good heavens
1	and he wrote a book and in fact there s a film
1	mm mm
1	erm i went i went to see it years well probably about twenty years ago it was called the last emperor and i think it was by a famous
1	oh yes
1	er director it can t remember it got a lot erm vocal desc misc a lot of er things but it it it tells the story of the last days of the emperor
1	right
1	erm how he grew up in you know the trunc m trunc trunc mag trunc magnificence of it
1	luxury yeah
1	but ended his life as a gardener he wrote his book and he said he was never vocal desc laugh more happy than when he was a gardener
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and trunc s trunc vocal desc laugh pause dur short or something like
1	well that says a lot doesn t it
1	yeah yeah that says a lot and i i think erm but er trunc a trunc and and there s erm and i i asked someone who what s happened to the family erm and er it s it it pause dur short er we you can t always you always don t know what the full truth is
1	mm
1	but what they say is that most of the trunc f trunc yeah most of the family or all the family still exist in some shape or form but trunc mo trunc a lot of them have become artists
1	oh right
1	and erm on board our our our our cruise ship there was a erm a chap who erm purportedly was related to er the the erm the emperor s family
1	mm
1	er and now he s a trunc i trunc an artist sort of selling his
1	right
1	wares etcetera but he he was quite a good artist actually erm but clearly that was much more acceptable than erm you know any kind of revolutionary vocal desc laugh
1	i was gonna say unclear if unclear
1	activity erm pause dur short anyway we went trunc thr trunc went round the the the forbidden city you know it s forbidden city it was only trunc for trunc it was only allowed reason it s forbidden is that only the emperor and his immediate family could go in there basically vocal desc misc erm pause dur short and er you can see pause dur short it it s it s it s in a way when you look at a national trust property
1	mm
1	a lot of them you see how people used to live and
1	mm
1	in in these in these places erm pause dur short it s very decorative outside pause dur short and and and a lot of this a lot of lot of money and expense has been
1	mm
1	er put to this but bear in mind erm it s pause dur short because they ve got so much er trunc peop trunc how many people
1	mm
1	they probably it probably doesn t cost them as much to do this as but still there s a lot of skill
1	mm
1	to to er refurbish and everything erm
1	so they re not so trunc orn trunc
1	but they but the inside
1	not so ornate
1	they pause dur short they they they re very ornate inside but they haven t got
1	yeah
1	it it strikes me as they they haven t got the sort of creature comforts as you have in a say national trust property but that might be because of the erm erm pause dur short that s the way used to live perhaps
1	well
1	very minimalist
1	yes pause dur short oh and also
1	mm
1	erm they would have lots and lots of lowly people bringing in food and things to them wouldn t they
1	yeah yeah
1	rather than actually
1	yeah
1	you could see this stove and where they were cooking and all that sort of thing
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short possibly not
1	yeah pause dur short i mean that s that a the the emperor er er trunc severa trunc lots and lots of buildings and this is one of the the emperor s
1	thrones
1	er thrones there pause dur short and you can see it s empty pause dur short you see the throne there it s empty
1	oh yeah
1	and you you you you you you feel there must ve been er tables chairs pause dur short erm nice ornaments
1	yeah
1	and those are the things that over the pause dur short years since the red army
1	unclear pause dur short yeah
1	the red army for example did erm pause dur short erm pause dur short break up destroy
1	yeah
1	er because they they saw it as erm pause dur short erm pause dur short you know against the ethos of the red trunc ar trunc er of the cultural revolution
1	how many people were in your party
1	er thirty nine
1	oh it s a big crowd isn t it
1	yeah yeah pause dur short so it s erm
1	they were all alright
1	yeah a very good group actually
1	yeah
1	very good group very very good group pause dur short see you can see the sort of pagodas pictures took some pictures of trunc chai trunc er some pause dur short er is that our pause dur short oh yes we erm on on the second day we had a bit of free time so pause dur short we wandered down pause dur short myself and anon nametype f type name wondered down to the local shop
1	mm
1	er when i say local shop it was a shopping centre
1	yeah
1	and erm and outside were these trees
1	oh aren t they beautiful
1	but trunc th trunc these are all artificial
1	oh are they
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	they re permanently in autumn colours then
1	yeah yeah pause dur short and at night they they all got lights
1	ah
1	yes pause dur short erm er but the thing was is i trunc w trunc i was in my trunc sh trunc er pause dur short t shirt shorts and sandals
1	yeah
1	vocal desc misc and we wandered into this shop pause dur short and er and it was more like selfridges
1	right
1	and and i felt slightly under dressed
1	oh dear
1	er but er but the erm but they had the the the the quality of the erm shoes and the the the jewellery and everything like that was really really really good
1	yeah
1	you know so erm pause dur short this is
1	well anon nametype m type name trunc a trunc
1	oh we
1	anon nametype m type name and i went to anon type place at the weekend
1	oh yeah yeah yeah
1	and erm it was like that in there
1	mm
1	i i looked in and there was a small head scarf
1	yeah
1	and it was nearly two hundred pounds
1	yes yeah
1	a anon type place s head scarf and i thought heck you know
1	yeah
1	if you wanted to take home a little erm pause dur short memento erm you wouldn t be paying two hundred pounds for it would you
1	no no no no no pause dur short trunc th trunc we went to a on one night we went erm a trunc f trunc a trunc fir trunc second night i think we were there we went to a show erm in er beijing which was er very interesting pause dur short they had erm pause dur short it was pause dur short erm pause dur short a sort of local pause dur short it it was a kung fu show
1	oh really
1	and it was about the history of how the erm the trunc a trunc pause dur short the there s a very tradition about kung fu and
1	yes
1	and and fighting and how that
1	yeah
1	how you could pause dur short yeah but that was very very colourful
1	mm mm
1	erm pause dur short oh that s a view from our pause dur short er pause dur short our hotel window there
1	mm
1	what s that pause dur short oh and then then we after that we went to pause dur short vocal desc laugh there s there s they they they love their animals i think that s a pause dur short some kind of snail or something
1	oh right
1	erm
1	huge
1	or or no a tortoise tortoise tortoise
1	we re looking at pause dur short we re looking at the picture of a huge er looks like marble snail or was it alabaster
1	tortoise i i think it might be tortoise a stone stone stone
1	stone stone tortoise huge
1	i think it s pause dur short er it s
1	man pause dur short as high as a man
1	yeah and and above that is the er i think it s the one of the key trunc r trunc emperor s kind of tombs and it
1	right
1	it s probably about fifteen hundred pause dur short fifteen hundred i should think pause dur short and we went down here it was a a a very nice walkway all the way through
1	looking at an avenue of trees now
1	yeah it s like with with the pause dur short with the various animals
1	oh i see
1	on on on either side
1	it s a sculpture park yes
1	there s pause dur short elephant elephant
1	i see
1	and the the all the tombs of the emperors that are called i can t remember what they re called erm
1	mm
1	valley of the emperors or something but
1	yeah
1	it all the trunc v trunc in this pause dur short erm in in these er in this area all the emperors from of of of several dynasties
1	right
1	and there s there s pause dur short this chap here was representing a high official pause dur short erm and then you had the elephant representing pause dur short something else vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	all the animals represent different things
1	yes pause dur short yeah
1	how we doing for time are we
1	well we re alright we ve erm if we could go on for another few minutes we ll reach an hour so
1	okay
1	won t be too bad today
1	so i ll i ll just quickly flash through these
1	so erm oh there s a new group of canoers back now
1	yeah
1	my goodness pause dur short yeah they re all different i think
1	this is when we went to the great wall
1	right
1	and we went along the wall pause dur short trunc al trunc down pause dur short and we went up over here pause dur short as er there s anon nametype f type name pause dur short there s me pause dur short trunc a trunc and we we obviously it s such a big wall we can t couldn t cover very much in it but it s very steep and trunc ve trunc
1	yes
1	very very steep in places but we we did a trunc f trunc you know a nice bit for a
1	mm
1	morning pause dur short and then we pause dur short we came back pause dur short er looked at quite a few vocal desc laugh we ve got to we we re gonna have to do a lot of editing on these yes that s a picture how steep it was
1	oh gosh it is steep
1	er yeah pause dur short erm but trunc luck trunc er they have they have erm there s lots of wall that s not that s not repaired very much
1	yes
1	er but but in where erm where the tourists go they ve put erm er what you call it erm
1	railings
1	railings there pause dur short because you need railings to pause dur short but but a lot of it is alright but some a lot of it is pause dur long oh yeah well that that actually is called i think it s called the bread basket and it s where the olympics pause dur short or the erm was held trunc r trunc erm
1	oh right yes
1	er where they they have all the big trunc a trunc athletics
1	yes
1	er events pause dur long that s our that s our typical room there
1	right looks very nice
1	er yeah yeah pause dur short oh yes we the lights were we we it this ll probably look better on a bigger screen but the lights in er just probably er anon nametype m type name will pause dur short erm trunc thi trunc this was quite amazing this is in a place called shan and this is a shopping centre but you wouldn t guess this it s a trunc shop trunc imagine shops on either side
1	yeah
1	and this is the ceiling
1	right
1	and it and and it and this trunc th trunc these are lights pause dur short changing they they love their neon lights
1	right
1	so they re the lights are changing all the time it s quite quite trunc s trunc trunc dramac trunc oh and also pause dur short this is where they erm because they ve got such high rise buildings
1	mm mm
1	and they haven t got space erm to do activities
1	yeah
1	a lot of the activities are done pause dur short in the erm
1	parks and public space yeah
1	trunc p trunc in parks pause dur short so so trunc the trunc these ladies get together every night or trunc whe trunc whenever erm in this space and erm
1	they re doing tai chi
1	tai tai chi or trunc kee trunc just keep fit
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	erm pause dur short yeah it s quite something to watch and then these pillars here pause dur short are erm again it s neon lights pause dur short and it they they they change colour pause dur short it it it s difficult to pause dur short can see it s trunc th trunc it s a whole whole pillar going up i dunno twenty twenty five
1	yeah
1	and and they it it s trunc ch trunc just changes colour all the time it d be better in a
1	oh right
1	in a in a video but it s it was quite something pause dur short so you can see all the different colours
1	yeah some beautiful colours
1	yeah they re it s all you know it s all electronic and all that sort of thing but the statues here that they ve created are are very artistic and erm they re very erm then we went to erm a water trunc s trunc a a water symphony
1	right
1	where basically you have lots of erm waterfalls
1	yes
1	water jets and changing colour and then they have music to go with the
1	oh lovely
1	it s really quite quite impressive you know it s erm
1	was there evening entertainments you had to trunc tr trunc buy tickets for or was that just there anyway
1	er that was there you just
1	mm
1	turned it we trunc dr trunc er the the the coach just took us there and
1	right
1	dropped us off and then we just erm er yeah it s it s pause dur short it s very good pause dur short you can see all the it s pause dur short erm some people trunc i trunc trunc i trunc they had security there because some people the some of the youngsters wanted to dash between the the the vocal desc laugh the jets
1	right
1	but the the security people just didn t want them to do that
1	no
1	cos i imagine it s health and safety as well actually pause dur short but it s all pause dur short the trunc ligh trunc you know the lighting the the the lighting is quite
1	yeah
1	quite pause dur long lots of neon pause dur short and trunc the trunc pause dur short vocal desc laugh yes unclear we were unclear
1	oh you can stand in a terracotta army uniform and have your photograph taken
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that s amazing
1	yeah i didn t think i i perhaps er pause dur short it was funny pause dur short the trunc w trunc but pause dur short the what they were doing here it was it was a bit of a sell but
1	mm
1	it was basically erm how er you could you could how the terracotta army people were made
1	yes
1	and and what you realise is just how much skill
1	yeah
1	goes into just making one terracotta army
1	yeah
1	and then of course you ve got the the terracotta army this is the ovens that they they use pause dur short quite basic really and these are the the individual components pause dur short that that go and then you could buy vocal desc laugh you know typically erm small terracotta army trunc peo trunc figures to to take back
1	yeah
1	the heads pause dur short er and all that trunc s trunc trunc thi trunc and all and then you had these sort of works of art pause dur short you can see that like that it s really
1	oh yes pause dur short yeah
1	were these trunc ta trunc no actually these are look look at that knackered tables
1	oh yes
1	and what what they found is is when they ve dug trunc o trunc dug open some of these tombs and things they ve found lacquered erm the the technique of lacquering goes back erm pause dur short oh you know trunc m trunc a lot longer than anyone trunc th trunc
1	yes
1	thought before and then and then there s the terracotta army people
1	it s incredible that every
1	mm
1	single face on the terracotta army is different isn t it
1	yes yes pause dur short trunc a trunc absolutely yeah it is
1	the
1	it
1	work that went into it
1	yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short the the the thing though that that that i couldn t quite trunc gra trunc quite trunc gra trunc grapple with was the the slightly macabre side so vocal desc misc basically they they were arranged in the regiment so you had different regiments
1	yeah
1	and then you had the central control place
1	yeah
1	er so you the command and control where the generals were it was it was a complete army underground er which you probably read about but erm he also erm for his trunc f trunc er he didn t want to be without his erm his concubines in his his trunc l trunc later life
1	yeah
1	so he he buried them alive underneath
1	oh dear
1	yeah yeah yeah so erm vocal desc laugh anon nametype f type name just didn t like didn t didn t couldn t the the thought
1	that must ve been terrifying can you imagine the night before you knew you were going to be buried alive
1	it pause dur short it pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah yeah yeah yeah pause dur short i could only imagine that erm pause dur short they were obviously they were buried with soldiers who had erm real trunc knive trunc er real er er real erm vocal desc misc er pause dur short what do you call it real swords and real this and real that
1	yeah
1	so so erm pause dur short it s either that or they pause dur short they you know they took poison or whatever who who knows but
1	right right
1	but but the pause dur short they they just closed the door and sealed it up pause dur short and that s what they did with all these trunc place trunc and what s also interesting is that they they they this is only just a small a relatively small proportion
1	right
1	of the whole thing
1	right
1	so what they re saying is is erm pause dur short vocal desc misc they won t erm pause dur short develop it further pause dur short trunc u trunc erm until they have the technology because once they open the tomb pause dur short the air gets in
1	yeah
1	and and and and trunc th trunc some of these things collapse
1	yeah
1	so erm er you can see all these trunc th trunc these are what they re working on at the moment pause dur short erm pause dur short you can see they re quite large figures pause dur short er vocal desc laugh pause dur short and but you can see things have collapsed
1	oh right
1	because they have big wooden things trunc g trunc struts going past
1	right
1	but as they ve opened things the oxygen s got in and the whole thing s collapsed so
1	right
1	so the what they re doing and and maybe it s maybe a cost
1	right
1	control thing is they re waiting until erm the technology is there and then they ll open it up and these are erm pause dur short these are pause dur short highly pause dur short trunc th trunc these are taken from the erm vocal desc misc er the pits as they re called
1	so we re looking at a picture of
1	of of a erm this might be pause dur short erm
1	it s a horse
1	yeah a horse and i m not sure whether he s a pause dur short erm pause dur short horse and rider possibly
1	yeah
1	erm but a warrior
1	yes
1	erm and i think this might be all in bronze
1	yeah
1	erm but the pause dur short if you trunc ju trunc trunc i trunc as you as you ll appreciate the the the amount of erm skill
1	mm mm
1	trunc bi trunc this this trunc b trunc er required and the volume pause dur short er that this required of to produce that
1	mm mm
1	erm pause dur short it was pause dur short the the theory behind all this of course was that er the the emperor always wanted to have be protected in his next life
1	yes
1	so as soon as he was about five or six years old
1	yeah
1	he he trunc a trunc and this guy this emperor lived for a long period of time he erm erm he was planning for his next life
1	right
1	so the reason why the terracotta army was there pause dur short in such large numbers was that he had a very long life and therefore he was able to to put a lot of resources into erm er the artistry and the and the creation of the erm pause dur short trunc h trunc horse the warriors
1	yeah
1	the pits and everything like that pause dur short vocal desc misc so erm pause dur short so so so trunc th trunc all this has was so when he died erm er trunc i trunc trunc i trunc it would all be ready for him to be put in there so
1	oh i see
1	erm
1	right
1	whereas if he left it till he was you know near his end of his life trunc u trunc trunc th trunc the next emperor
1	mm mm
1	wouldn t be thinking about the previous emperor
1	no of course not no
1	he d be he d be spending his money on the vocal desc laugh
1	yes
1	oh his trunc o trunc vocal desc laugh on his own er next life
1	yeah
1	erm but there s thousands of arrowheads and oh i mean it s just it s just erm pause dur short it is it s it s quite quite er
1	so would you like to bring it to a close now
1	yes yeah i ll bring it to a close vocal desc laugh absolutely okay and there s a a chariot

1	yeah
1	it weren t last year
1	the place is a charity thing
1	is it what the whole studio is a charity
1	i don t er
1	or the whole gallery rather
1	yeah i think so
1	oh right
1	but pause dur short but i trunc do trunc don t understand what makes it a charity
1	well you have to register stuff for to be a charity don t you so i expect
1	i mean do they
1	like trunc wel trunc
1	do they donate
1	like anon type place and what have you pause dur short that s a charity
1	but what makes it a charity
1	well you have to you have to er apply for one i expect you have to apply for the licence cos you get you get a number if you trunc agr trunc if they agree that you re er you re a charity and trunc j trunc and not in it for trunc m trunc to making money
1	mm
1	at anon type place dot co dot uk doc you can er dot org sorry pause dur short you can pause dur short register that you see and you you have
1	is it cos er the benefit of the people
1	and you you have you have to display your number
1	yeah but trunc i trunc pause dur short because no one actually price
1	well they don t pay tax if they if they
1	no individual profits sure
1	no
1	right okay
1	nobody makes money out of that pause dur long
1	so the gallery is
1	is the charity itself
1	mm
1	and then all the money goes to
1	and the money goes to
1	goes into charity
1	into the gallery or
1	mm
1	whatever
1	unclear
1	mm pause dur short so i suppose pause dur short mm pause dur short it just goes for the running of it then

1	yeah
1	whichever council run run the place or trunc ow trunc owns the place pause dur short they get funds for that pause dur short from the councils and then

1	yeah yeah
1	that help small people
1	mm
1	with their er works
1	odd thing isn t it this charity status
1	yeah pause dur long
1	yeah
1	they do have to go through a lot of scrutinisation though when they trunc p trunc they become a charity
1	mm must be quite a lot mustn t it

0	okie dokie
0	truly special
0	oh good
0	right
0	debacle
0	i like that word
0	okay
0	you can request it i m sure
0	and not a lot of people said yeah
0	yeah pause dur short oh yeah pause dur short erm so it worked quite well pause dur short i loved his er slightly terse response pause dur short oh
0	don t feel bad pause dur short he ll have laughed and then been like i can t see unclear like i said i think he s just very kind of conscious that he wants to be a complete professional
0	oh i m really sorry chuck pause dur short erm yeah
0	well to a certain extent it s generally
0	so unclear
0	right
0	okay well we ll do that pause dur short well i think if we do the same default then when we ll
0	yeah pause dur short so yeah we could either call in straight from work or just come back and just she can just sign up when we go unclear kind of thing pause dur short but erm yeah it should be good pause dur short we could try and book in to body pump on tuesday
0	on on monday unclear
0	yeah exactly pause dur short it works out quite well
0	yeah
0	well you didn t pause dur short yeah you didn t really though you kind of stayed in the middle pause dur short so you know obviously just not working it out properly
0	and it s er what was it a peugeot thingamabob
0	a tall thing
0	does he want to give you the car
0	well bearing in mind i was half contemplating that an automatic might be good for you for some drivers
0	just getting used to the experience on the road without having to bother to bother you about gears
0	yeah and then put them in at the end pause dur short yeah
0	you know it s not unclear holding it like that and you re unclear
0	unclear point out but it s your job to talk to me
0	erm i imagine he ll just sell it to one of the pause dur short er but i don t think it s erm but it a sort of mobility one pause dur short actually i don t know if he can sell it he s got it through a scheme thing erm because of a grant so he might have to just give it back
0	fair enough
0	so but he doesn t want at sixty
0	and it s maybe a unclear and they ll maybe get a bit more help in pause dur short because i think my dad really has been doing quite a lot
0	well it s not yeah it s not entirely unreasonable to expect families to do
0	yeah
0	unclear erm yeah i don t think my dad has minded doing it at all i think it s more just that if he s not particularly well himself erm yeah then we might be able to get somebody in to er
0	help him out unclear
0	well she was planning on retiring the minute she hits sixty and but there s been no talk of it so presumably she s keeping going while things are still kind of
0	yeah pause dur short you probably could
0	a six hour shift on a saturday probably
0	yeah exactly it wouldn t kill you
0	yeah
0	yeah so is it eight quid now probably
0	if you were creative so what like it s eight times six and that s er forty eight fifty quid a week you know that s
0	unclear
0	as in yeah
0	no no
0	well no any subjects could english could objectively
0	yeah but you d need to try and unclear fair enough pause dur short but on the other hand if you could do that much work at cambridge and still be a unclear member of a couple of different societies and still have a social life and you could damn well do all of that and have a job at leeds
0	yeah
0	unclear
0	unclear
0	she usually does pause dur short she s been pretty
0	well no that wasn t bringing stuff like that up it was being inappropriate with just inappropriate levels of discussion about me that s attention seeking not really stuff like that unclear
0	but i can imagine her bringing that up though
0	unclear you know that s something that that s not what i think she likes to think about
0	mm
0	what because she d have started unclear the degree
0	yeah exactly pause dur short erm and likewise it didn t occur to her to get a job in the eight months that she wasn t doing anything else which i still can t quite believe pause dur short i don t understand
0	i mean i did tell her to sort of make sure she did something
0	i did tell her to make sure she did something with it and she didn t really and which is such a shame because it was a really good opportunity to get some really good solid even unpaid work just working for that for six months would have been incredible for her cv
0	yeah
0	erm
0	so i was very intensively pause dur short yeah i was i was really i really was spending all day doing job applications and also i did teach myself proof reading which in retrospect was a very good idea
0	right yeah erm that s again you just pause dur short oh that s quite dangerous
0	maybe you know so unclear you know instead of employee of the month they have like a sin bin
0	i don t know i mean it s actually quite weird sort of think thinking back to all the interviews and stuff i did and how just how much better qualified i am now to do things pause dur short does that make sense so just comparing yeah
0	no
0	unclear because you re working as a team of people who you are working with and you want to the same goal
0	for the academic anon type place and they they basically have to prepare a presentation as if they as if we were a group of science undergraduates pause dur short erm
0	yes
0	i mean that s a year year s contract
0	i would just pick one of them if i was you
0	if they don t do it then
0	like it unclear another one
0	oh
0	versus our approach of just
0	unclear but what we actually produce is actually want as far as i understand just actual conversations
0	yeah pause dur short i mean it s sometimes we we ask for specific things because obviously unclear okay we d really like some recordings of teenagers talking about it so we get that pause dur short but yeah there s normally it s just erm yeah people talking in two thousand and twelve unclear
0	erm so she unclear sort of ideas what she s going to do close to uni yes
0	yeah yeah
0	well i think she s still half thinking about the teaching which will be good
0	i mean i had
0	she unclear
0	no it s certainly different
0	no
0	mm
0	yeah
0	quite weird
0	yeah i know but unclear
0	okay erm can i borrow your pause dur short i don t have his number
0	so yeah unclear
0	shall i read it anon nametype m type name oh you still up date went well pause dur short what was that
0	i think if you text him back
0	no don t bring it back
0	i ll bring it back
0	oh
0	trunc o trunc on the phone pause dur short okay erm right
0	just say er hi er just picked it up sorry er had a mental piss up with my dad last night pause dur short er
0	so am i actually it s not the most intuitive interface and i ll probably get used to it eventually
0	sorry just picked it up pause dur short sorry just picked it up just pause dur short just pause dur short sorry just picked your message up or something like that
0	piss up it wasn t in the dictionary
0	okay i think now we ve stopped which is surprising but excellent pause dur short oh that s a pothole
0	erm er er er and then just details details details exclamation mark
0	so do you think that should be er unclear you trying to just pick a message up comma
0	after pick your message up
0	hi sorry just picked your message up pause dur short had a rather family piss up last night
0	yeah is that a question mark and exclamation mark
0	question mark exclamation mark okay
0	have we managed that simple task
0	so now i ll ring your grandpa
0	anon nametype m type name yeah
0	you also forgot to get your ipod out
0	yeah pause dur short oh well pause dur short we can listen to it on the way back
0	but you were talking at the same time so i didn t quite catch but i think he said oh for lunch erm which was good so
0	yeah but unclear
0	yes pause dur short unclear
0	unclear random quality element to it
0	yes entirely yeah
0	yeah so that s why i thought it was you know quite a good unclear take a look pause dur short erm
0	just incredible pause dur short there should be a law against driving without a brain
0	yes pause dur short well that s actually because they re not cycling through
0	yes exactly
0	ah okay
0	okay
0	yes short answer pause dur short unclear
0	unclear so what if you
0	wow
0	incredible
0	well it s not performance it s unclear
0	because they re good
0	like the swedes have clearly realised
0	the swedes are right
0	that s interesting yeah
0	current affairs unclear it would have been in the news fairly prominently
0	you won t know what what time they re on
0	yeah the capacity to get on and say you want it because otherwise it s yeah it s limited in its usefulness i think
0	because the hardware would connect you to the signal and it s just a question of
0	i d assume
0	well it s not if you re a trade you can connect to the wi fi in order to log on
0	unclear a service station unclear
0	i don t like that that s weird
0	that reminds me of the massive marshmallow man in erm ghostbusters
0	well the ipod has got a speaker in it
0	and you know to buy that specific one which was quite an effort unclear a bit specific one pause dur short but i m very pleased we did because that was by far the nicest one there
0	stop it
0	exactly yeah pause dur short erm yeah all of that your mum wants one but she really doesn t pause dur short she she s not that keen pause dur short do you think you d buy a macbook
0	but occasionally move it just so as to unclear
0	oh i m sure they have
0	yeah i bought a kind of fanta from there and then looked at it and it was erm it had a writing on it i didn t recognise the alphabet and i and it was a brighter colour orange than i d seen fanta before and i thought i m not sure i should be really very sure what to drink this pause dur short so i just threw it out pause dur short ridiculous pause dur short it just looked wrong you know what i mean
0	i drank it there yeah
0	but i was er pause dur short oh thinking of college i was reading the financial policy and you know thanks to rigorous cost control measures we re actually not doing that badly including pay and bonus freezes for staff
0	shit
0	and i said hah alright that s why the porters must be pissed off
0	yeah exactly
0	it must employ fifty people and
0	and yeah you ve got pause dur short i mean i guess it s a very odd thing to be on the other side of it and see all these students running around and then know that you re not your pay isn t going to go up this year
0	yes pause dur short yeah yeah pause dur short i guess that makes it easier
0	no pause dur short no they re not and it s very much apply to the college you like the look of and it doesn t make a difference but it no really does and trunc y trunc yeah it s not

0	yeah nice pause dur short yeah that s just ridiculous that s not
0	you know look on google apps

0	they re targeting the right people i guess because yeah this is just it s stupid it s not pause dur short if these are serious concerns that are affecting access
0	schools
0	and and the trunc g trunc general attitude of the school is critical and some schools have a very bad approach and you know they should be going to schools and teaching headmasters and headmistresses and head teachers pause dur short sorry pause dur short and teachers and anon type place coordinators and they should be teaching the heads
0	no
0	unclear but but not even that it s unclear be doing with schools should just be unclear but it s not just pause dur short but so much of it isn t about that it s about so what gcse choices are you making and what a level choices are you taking
0	mm
0	no it it was in the thirties but worn off
0	but no i agree i think erm the the the access is kind of it s so small scale and talking to individual students and i m not sure

0	how possibly and you re judging anon type place
0	of being elitist
0	that would be a meaningful thing and anywhere with selective entry
0	a lot of state schools you know are getting what two million and in some cases as low as twenty per cent of people getting five as and a stars and cs
0	they can t do it
0	yeah
0	and you just you d just be an incredible ignorance of people and the media playing up to people
0	well i know but most people think that selecting people for academic students on the basis of academic ability is elitist
0	yes
0	yeah
0	people don t think about it like this like
0	there s a there s a yeah there s a disconnection exactly pause dur short it s a it s a progression so like rather than a an academic pause dur short i think we very much think of it as an academic unclear

0	yes the idea being that he and i could alternate weeks with anon nametype m type name
0	yeah pause dur short yeah you d think so
0	now the rowing machine i click just row
0	mm pause dur short oh my god the treadmill in the gym at work rocks when you run on it pause dur short probably er why my foot was in a state pause dur short probably running more on one foot than the other
0	you re um gonna be in good shape for this ten k
0	i think you probably can pause dur short in fact i m sure you can
0	yeah pause dur short it will actually be easier doing um the ten k when there s things to look at because um i think i ve got snow blinders from that run pause dur short i m running literally into a white painted wall pause dur short could have been right up against the wall pause dur short white wall
0	but i was wondering at pause dur short i was wondering about them getting another tv and putting it

0	like heavy ac
0	yeah pause dur short okay pause dur short ha i don t know what the cup one s got but if the window was open we d just suspect it might be the ac or it s warm pause dur short ha
0	they ve probably spent quite a lot of money on
0	did anyone say though
0	as in they ve got pause dur short well you should read this email pause dur short it s like
0	ha pause dur short don t do anything in this room
0	yeah basically
0	well so it s got a posh coffee machine and it s not for clients and we ve been told not to use for other purposes pause dur short so it s like why
0	is it free
0	with the little sachets pause dur short i love those
0	oh right
0	yeah
0	and unclear five cylinders sound awesome
0	i don t like them pause dur short i don t understand trunc v trunc it

0	yeah well exactly pause dur short well that s what i mean
0	but it doesn t make any difference
0	i m fine thank you
0	active
0	yeah
0	but that s ridiculous that that s happened and no one s told us about it pause dur short it must have done some serious damage to the car
0	but they put tyre marks onto it pause dur short that s a whole different
0	mm
0	level of impact
0	mm
0	hmm mm pause dur short as it very much were
0	they ve got that on completion pause dur short i wondered who the hell they gave it to
0	well
0	mm
0	right pause dur short ha i bet yeah cos you remember all of that cos you know who was at scholars dinner
0	we were talking about it
0	ha ha yeah pause dur short hmm pause dur short we re coming to rescue you from that dark place pause dur short what ah i thought you were pausing to say something but you were just chewing
0	erm which one the one from the year below us or the one from the year above us
0	oh pause dur short anon nametype f type name
0	yeah or something like that
0	she s held up as an example of some one who has done well pause dur short she s done the graduate programme for a leading charity in london
0	no it s erm it s interesting
0	erm but she s like i don t know if she wrote all this herself but it so ridiculous pause dur short i just wanna slap her
0	she probably didn t then pause dur short she s really nice
0	mm
0	which is broken up
0	yeah i suspect so
0	erm pause dur short i mean this other guy who got erm he dropped out of vets after doing the erm bachelor bit so preclinical vets
0	it s actually a very unusual degree with a two two
0	ha well it s just you know trunc y trunc you find out how many questions there are
0	unclear well anyway pause dur short what so he hasn t done very well
0	yeah well you know this guy was saying he was doing five or six a week
0	and i did that for a while pause dur short i think i was at it for a couple of months
0	you you weren t going into graduate schemes
0	any trunc ch trunc pause dur short no pause dur short um i was looking for any publishing pause dur short any kind of charity pause dur short any college job like administration job pause dur short erm any museum
0	well i dunno pause dur short actually no that being said it would have got you er six months experience
0	unfortunately they probably knew that
0	yeah pause dur short in all fairness all the jobs knew that pause dur short and this was er the job i ve got was one of the high level ones i applied for and maybe that was my mistake
0	yeah obviously pause dur short and it s gonna then cost them to recruit again
0	it s an interesting tip though pause dur short aim high
0	because if you aim too low you won t get it
0	mm pause dur short i don t think any one s paid anything in theatre pause dur short hmm
0	sorry
0	oh god pause dur short i love that pause dur short erm so erm yeah we often say islam isn t very nice to you know it s prejudice against women pause dur short you know they have sharia law pause dur short sharia law pause dur short whatever the fuck it is
0	bugger all no no sorry bugger someone um
0	well he was pause dur short well um pause dur short what he did do was was stand up and say i refuse to be treated like this when somebody treated him badly pause dur short which is good
0	in what sense
0	vocal desc laugh so lord queensberry trunc wro trunc erm wrote um you see oscar wilde had a play on him and and queensberry hated wilde for obvious reasons and um sent him like a bouquet of kind of rotting vegetables with a card saying posing sondimite pause dur short he spells it wrong pause dur short um and um wilde took objection to this and sued him for slander pause dur short and um it s he won the case but then he was investigated for um for sodomy pause dur short and i don t really know er i think er yeah
0	no um but i i never liked him purely because he s got that stephen fry complex of
0	mm pause dur short tenuous tenuous
0	but you ah but if if you oh you say oh cos i ve read um i ve read hamlet pause dur short apparently shakespeare played hamlet s father so i m gonna make unclear about hamlet s character pause dur short it s a
0	oh sorry pause dur short what s it called
0	lady trunc min trunc s trunc fa trunc lady windermere s trunc f trunc unclear
0	the lord chap pause dur short erm
0	okay pause dur short mm pause dur short but do you you know do you know anything about him as a person have you read any biographies or read any of his kind of unclear or kind of looked into him a bit more rather than just his his work i mean you can just like his work but i m not sure that really unless you can really point that to the author
0	yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short that s what i mean you can you can refuse to watch the film wilde but i m not sure you re gonna trunc necessar trunc necessarily say i dislike oscar wilde for that reason pause dur short and actually wilde isn t quite as good as me or anon nametype m type name thought he was pause dur short vocal desc laugh we watched it
0	wilde isn t as good as me or anon nametype m type name thought it was pause dur short we watched it one time with a bottle of wine um last year i think pause dur short and at the end we were both a bit like yeah it s alright but we all came we both came up with this massive list of reasons why it was a bit erm glossy pause dur short ha pause dur short and we didn t like it quite as much as we did when we were eighteen
0	you watched it when you were eighteen
0	mm
0	and from the same era pause dur short um kitchener pause dur short er churchill pause dur short um
0	you see again pause dur short right watch the film that er mum gave me for christmas the modern adaptation of his early life
0	yeah pause dur short it s a sort of semi autobiographic
0	mm
0	well it was semi auto as in it s unclear but i d strongly suggest watching that um it was fascinating pause dur short but there is a complex character
0	why unfortunate
0	sorry
0	unclear
0	so we re talking a man whose father was in a mental institution
0	a man who had a a trunc doc trunc a medical doctor who had a very interesting relationship with his mentor
0	cos of course er trunc d trunc er doyle is watson
0	well that s interesting pause dur short not sherlock
0	you didn t know that
0	right
0	it s really good pause dur short your unclear ha pause dur short i said that like famous have you if you ve seen it a few times pause dur short um what was i saying um pause dur short conan doyle unclear dad
0	moving on pause dur short please god
0	and he he s married but he begins an affair
0	not exactly no
0	sort of thing pause dur short no
0	and he supports her very faithfully through that while also seeing his mistress who he then marries after his wife s death
0	mm
0	yes thank you
0	please pause dur short thank you pause dur short er look no further
0	was it opium he took i don t think it
0	yes
0	it s not opium
0	it s er it is
0	cos i find that interesting about sherlock holmes
0	no some drugs do
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah
0	so the beetles wouldn t have written a lot of their crazy music without acid
0	acid
0	mm
0	fair enough yeah pause dur short ha ha pause dur short i m just making the point that you know trunc s trunc being like so and so on acid isn t necessarily a particularly good thing pause dur short but um yeah um so the beetles were kind of taking drugs and wrote this amazing weird psychedelic music pause dur short and you kind of think well obviously they re really bad and they destroy you but
0	oh yeah
0	um possibly pause dur short what do you reckon
0	yeah do you wanna have a look
0	there are like two doughnuts a mini lemon and a mini chocolate
0	yeah is that alright okay unclear
0	yeah that sounds good pause dur short seb hasn t got back to me
0	ring him
0	i ll ring him when we ve finished pause dur short i don t know what he s doing tonight pause dur short he might be in rehearsal in all fairness pause dur short ah no last er last thursday was he in rehearsal
0	yes
0	i loved it when he discovers in the modern film that playing random notes if this randomly but then when he plays a erm chromatic scale they they switch flying circles pause dur short i think that s er funny
0	okay sure
0	third series
0	that was very different pause dur short that was very much a this was a cosy stuck in the middle of space where unclear and that was
0	the blue ones
0	yes pause dur short and that bit with the er the god planet was weird
0	vocal desc laugh
0	it would certainly make you think about what why
0	yeah
0	yeah exactly that s the difference in stargate
0	it is a catch twenty two i agree
0	it s really interesting
0	yes
0	cos
0	sort of pause dur short but also because most sci fi series are only ever run for seven series
0	oh right
0	complicated
0	alright i ll just get you a couple of small spoons pause dur short okay
0	i feel that this may be over priced
0	shotgun chocolate
0	thank you
0	okay enjoy pause dur short thank you
0	thank you very much
0	oh
0	he stopped being the leader of sg after season seven
0	right
0	so trunc pr trunc was that kind of a a pretty big part then
0	so trunc th trunc presumably he could rock up do a lot of his things in a shorter time period
0	oh almost none
0	mm
0	yeah
0	um
0	he was still quite involved then
0	yeah but he did that for the entire series pause dur short that s why stargate was so much his
0	yeah
0	that s one of the nice things about it pause dur short it was his series pause dur short it just the quirky humour pause dur short the
0	you know it had serious moral issues but it was also funny in a way that star trek never was
0	a lot of the comedy came pause dur short yeah it s entertaining but not funny
0	that was nice pause dur short hugely over charged
0	yeah ooh i need to get my thing out
0	does she know how long she s gonna be off
0	right
0	i assumed you had to say when you were coming back pause dur short apparently not pause dur short seriously maternity trunc l trunc rules like maternity laws are ridiculous cos you re not allowed by law to give away the person s desk if they don t want you to pause dur short unclear you have to reserve their desk as a testament
0	no but you surely you have to replace them
0	see i still don t think it s reasonable that you have that kind of pause dur short i mean maternity leave is paid as well isn t it
0	mm pause dur short it depends how long you re on it for pause dur short erm if trunc on trunc once you get past a certain month that it gets paid a very small percentage i think pause dur short it s not pause dur short you re not in in you re kind of on
0	yeah
0	i m sorry but why shouldn t
0	no but in all fairness though dad s can have fully paid paternity leave
0	well by that logic you should be able to have it for adoption
0	you can pause dur short yeah pause dur short you can get maternity for adoption
0	exactly because
0	remind me never to employ a woman pause dur short oh fuck did you see what cameron did today it s international woman s day
0	cameron
0	yeah david cameron
0	so you know it s international woman s day
0	vocal desc laugh
0	er but you know so he s now making stalking a criminal offence pause dur short specifically stalking pause dur short er
0	that seems reasonable cos stalking is kind of scary
0	no but stalking is
0	specifically what this does is enables the police to enter a property without a warrant on suspicion of stalking pause dur short unclear well why what possible good is that going to do
0	mm
0	right
0	it s like oh the police have enough power to deal with it and should just bloody do it pause dur short i don t understand pause dur short if someone is stalking someone how does it get er how does er entering their house help you
0	yes
0	and getting access to their account
0	unclear
0	well yeah so i haven t actually properly um this is the only this is the only bit of the only episode i ve ever seen pause dur short so the bit he goes into this woman s house and she er like on some part of the case but then she s got like loads of pictures of him pause dur short and some about his case and like she s been photographing him and it s all over her like her living room wall pause dur short so i guess if it was that kind of level
0	i know
0	unclear catching fire unclear
0	erm
0	so we put the drying on overnight for white drying
0	and then put the other washing on over the weekend to come back and sort it out on sunday
0	okay
0	there you go
0	actually no it doesn t make sense we need to either get it out tomorrow morning pause dur short you don t wanna leave it in the washing machine

1	you probably wouldn t ve learn a lot more
1	well i tell you what i would rather trunc h trunc have the skills i ve got now as a you know engineer and woodworking and all that sort of stuff than go to a grammar school and just have the skills of trunc l trunc knowing how to count
1	you learn other things as well
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short such as vocal desc laugh
1	well you d ve learnt all the trunc s trunc all the rest as well
1	latin
1	that s only part of it isn t it
1	well this is what put us off
1	they still do woodworking and stuff
1	they didn t do a lot in grammar schools pause dur short they didn t do anything like that then because they were more potential office workers and government workers rather than
1	well i did er
1	they were academics
1	but i did art needlework and domestic science and things
1	well there was that there was that
1	took all my trunc l trunc exams in those

1	oh dear yeah
1	no pure maths is totally different pause dur short i loved maths pause dur short i used to do trunc m trunc do homework for lots of other people as well pause dur short show them how
1	did you get paid for it
1	no
1	why not
1	well you just help people out don t you
1	oh god pause dur short you see this this is where secondary modern and
1	vocal desc laugh what you d ve charged for it
1	well of course
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short i ll do your homework if you pay me
1	that s right pause dur short and it happened at our school
1	oh i just help people out i like i i like pause dur short erm working out things pause dur short i liked all the erm working out the side of the triangle and things like that
1	oh i i have to say that you re a lot better at working out than i am pause dur short i have to i have to give that one to you
1	but yeah pause dur short i think it does change your trunc m trunc change your thinking some even though it s not mathematical your thinking changes
1	yeah pause dur short well pause dur short this is where we had
1	how to logic and things come into it i think
1	yeah well we had arguments with our teacher well not arguments but pause dur short er questions to the teacher pause dur short just a stupid er what why do we have to learn about algebra it s really a stupid thing when are we going to trunc l trunc use algebra in our lives
1	yeah well you don t don t use it really unclear
1	and he said well it s not the use it s to get your mind working pause dur short to get you thinking correctly
1	yes
1	and that s what he told us pause dur short and we thought what a waste of time pause dur short but there you go
1	yeah pause dur short yeah it s just working things out isn t it
1	yeah
1	mm
1	yeah
1	unclear how a squared equals b times brackets vocal desc laugh
1	oh god
1	c minus d
1	yeah
1	gets complicated but
1	equals two e pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	so what is a or what is c
1	yeah pause dur short that s right pause dur short but that does pause dur short you have to think about that don t you that s the whole point
1	yeah
1	you have to think
1	really hard yeah
1	yeah and er that was
1	mm
1	the whole point of algebra pause dur short to train your mind
1	mm
1	whereas er we we couldn t see that pause dur short we just couldn t see that at all pause dur short but there you go pause dur short when we were in er in er primary school well er or the infants they call they called it then pause dur short we had to learn our tables before we went up to the junior school
1	yeah pause dur short so did anon nametype f type name
1	yeah
1	she was told she she has to trunc l trunc she has to know them all
1	yeah pause dur short and so we
1	be able to chant them
1	we had to chant them
1	mm
1	every day pause dur short and
1	yeah
1	and that s really weird because chanting makes you remember
1	mm pause dur short it does pause dur short it s like songs isn t it
1	yeah
1	keep singing the words of a song you get them
1	and then our teacher used to go pause dur short five nines pause dur short forty five oh right thank you right you pause dur short and and er trunc s trunc he he just used to shoot at us you know with with his
1	yeah
1	finger and say pause dur short and that
1	we used to play a game called buzz pause dur short where you had to go round the round the classroom going one two three four pause dur short say say you were doing the seven times table
1	yeah
1	you buzzed when it was like seven or fourteen or twenty one
1	oh i see pause dur short right
1	or whichever name you were pause dur short but really you had to pause dur short a matter of counting up but it was quite good
1	well yeah pause dur short well i mean to make things into games that s that s
1	mm yeah pause dur short anything really
1	that s how they try to do it nowadays make them into games don t they
1	mm
1	so that people learn through games or fun rather than through
1	yeah
1	oh vocal desc sigh meticulous sort of
1	i suppose most stuff you learn through er a bit of a play don t you
1	well yes
1	vocal desc cough if you can muck about with something
1	yeah
1	you realise what you have to do
1	yeah well i mean trunc e trunc er trunc s trunc sports and cricket and football and all that sort of thing pause dur short still helps you funnily enough with counting pause dur short cos cricket you
1	yeah
1	have to score pause dur short i mean we didn t play cricket at our school mind you trunc becau trunc pause dur short well not much well i didn t like it because if you got hit by that ball that hurt
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh i remember this boy he was brilliant bowler pause dur short he come tearing down and bowled the ball and i chucked the bat down and run off vocal desc laugh
1	oh dear
1	and i thought i m not gonna get hit by that pause dur short so no i didn t get picked for trunc cri trunc for cricket
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i didn t get picked for football
1	you run away from the ball then
1	i trunc di trunc pause dur short no i wanted to play football but all all the teachers pets played football
1	yeah pause dur short they did
1	and we were put on the tennis tennis courts
1	mm
1	cleaning up the leaves on the tennis courts
1	it s very bad isn t it when they
1	yeah
1	they do pick the same people for teams
1	er all the time
1	so if you weren t any good in the beginning you ll never get a chance
1	no
1	to get good
1	no you don t pause dur short i scored a terrific goal pause dur short it trunc w trunc it was terrific goal pause dur short and the teacher said pause dur short no goal pause dur short why he said you you gotta keep your elbows in while you re running you try and keep your elbows in when you re running
1	oh right
1	and i though oh you big pause dur short and er from then on in i never played football
1	but there trunc i trunc there s only so many in a team isn t there they shouldn t worry about that when you re at school
1	no
1	cos there s never gonna be exactly the trunc amou trunc amount for a team pause dur short so i trunc d trunc
1	no
1	i don t know if they ve changed it now but you should all be able to play shouldn t you
1	you should be pause dur short yeah pause dur short everybody
1	mm
1	but you see the two favourite boys was pause dur short they were anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name pause dur short and that was anon nametype m type name s team that was anon nametype m type name s team and they would call out who they wanted on their side pause dur short one at a time and of course there was about eight of us left vocal desc laugh

1	that nobody wanted vocal desc laugh pause dur short so they went off playing football
1	yeah
1	and we went off cleaning up the tennis courts
1	mm
1	and that s how it was
1	vocal desc misc yeah pause dur short very unfair
1	it was unfair
1	yeah
1	but then the teachers the the the sports the pe teachers then were they wanted er to play you know a good game
1	yeah
1	they didn t want someone who who dawdled around vocal desc laugh the pitch or something like that
1	that s right pause dur short that s the same with erm country dancing they only want either eight or four in a group don t they and
1	yeah that s right yeah
1	so if you re if there are any odd ones pause dur short had to sit out
1	mind you i got picked to run for for er anon type place right just running

0	is it within your means yeah oh i ll do it then
0	yeah going for like waxes and things before my honeymoon and it all just added up to the point where i just didn t feel any better off than i do now on on less money
0	most of it goes in erm goes in taxes and i like i was paying a lot more tax and paying back my student loan a lot more at anon type place as well so a lot of that money would go out of my account before i d seen it whereas now i m on i m on such a small amount that i don t pay back my student loan
0	at all and i m paying tax but they taxed me a stupid amount when i arrived and now they can t charge me any more because i ve basically i ve paid all the tax that i should in a whole year in one go

0	that s why i bought it i assumed it was that
0	nice manager pause dur short and have everybody respect you for being a nice manager and i might say that s why this like that s why anon nametype f type name who took me on was brilliant because you wanted to do well for her
0	yeah
0	cos i know it s a business and i know it s anon type place and i know it s on anon type place street and i know that there s a massive pressure and we re thirty ninth in the country last week
0	you ain t gonna be you re not gonna be number one you re not so unclear erm the big we re not we re not the big one are we
0	we re not the flagship we re not gonna be number one i know you should always do your best and everything but don t look at thirty ninth and go that s bad

0	ah
0	i find mushrooms are bad for that

0	we ve been to it pause dur short as in we ve been outside it pause dur short but i think it was when we were out with anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name
0	yeah i remember that
0	yes pause dur short stay there
0	vocal desc laugh i didn t know there was a match on today pause dur short unclear the only time i know when there s a match on is if anon nametype m type name at work at work mentions it
0	hmm mm pause dur short strange but true
0	no it s true as in someone said it
0	mm
0	yeah i mean just if you d like to see her then it s an idea
0	yeah pause dur short i was thinking we could eat with my parents and then go out and see anon nametype f type name kind of nine or ten pause dur short um we could see them in the town or trunc a trunc
0	well it s going to take us at least an hour to cook and eat
0	mm

0	yeah
0	what does that number plate say do you reckon
0	it looks quite good
0	i wasn t particularly looking
0	oh dear

0	er yes it is pause dur short not nothing particularly exciting but erm
0	yes pause dur short when did that shut

0	well it ll be shut when we get back
0	mm
0	mm unclear londoners
0	cricket pause dur short lawn tennis and football pause dur short wow
0	what s the difference between lawn tennis and tennis
0	i imagine lawn tennis you play on the grass pause dur short whereas tennis is presumably varying surfaces pause dur short huh pause dur short i don t know if it s different to unclear have different surfaces don t they
0	and then sort of is wimbledon on grass or not
0	is it that s the thing i genuinely don t know
0	no
0	no i don t know pause dur short unclear no one really knows or cares how andy murray is doing
0	no it s not that pause dur short i mean they probably wouldn t wanna be pleased if he did pause dur short they don t care particularly
0	yeah but pause dur short but there d be more a kind of oh england s won rather than oh that nice chap
0	well he s too good
0	well yeah he is
0	chance pause dur short he s not really an underdog character
0	well peter sampras was sort of pause dur short when i started to watch tennis he was sort of a pause dur short do you know what i mean i think he still the record for the number of wimbledon titles
0	oh right pause dur short what
0	american
0	mm
0	nadal
0	yeah just i mean federer seems quite nice but nadal doesn t
0	nadal is the grumpy one
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	and henman virtually never did it
0	yeah pause dur short no yeah exactly it shows a certain kind of arrogance i think
0	indeed pause dur long i can see you ve got all these to please me
0	what henman
0	was
0	no
0	i vaguely understand it being fifty but forty is pushing it
0	there s no reason not to pause dur short there s no significant hazards pause dur short erm pause dur short that was interesting
0	what is
0	well there s trunc like trunc pause dur short it s not that big
0	i think it still is green pause dur short but they had a little sort of poll on the front of the echo pause dur short so like four different colours pause dur short so they had like a black one a green one er whatever you know something else pause dur short and then this bright red one pause dur short ha and everyone was like the bright red one pause dur short next to the unclear it was brilliant pause dur short er no
0	can you not stripe it
0	yeah
0	indeed
0	huh
0	that car but one
0	okay
0	two point five t pause dur short what does the t stand for
0	i think it s ugly in a charming way
0	um yeah it is after that yeah pause dur short handy little sign there pause dur short metrocentre straight on
0	is that a new building they re putting up
0	looks like it doesn t it flats presumably
0	yes
0	mm pause dur short it does seem odd trunc dimans trunc dismantling it brick by brick pause dur short i mean it seems a bit of a waste of time
0	do you know what i mean they build sort of slightly lower wider
0	no it it just seems like an a kind of an unusual thing to be building pause dur short i haven t seen many blocks of flats like that being built
0	excused
0	ha ha pause dur short how long can i keep excusing you as long as it takes
0	er
0	erm
0	it s okay pause dur short i ve got that figured
0	yeah
0	ah pause dur short no not really
0	yeah and i guess you you know if you wanna go to newcastle you wanna stay somewhere rubbish pause dur short ha you know anon type place good enough pause dur short i was thinking that anon type place itself is has got some really nice stuff
0	ha pause dur short i m not entirely sure at a given moment exactly what to do next pause dur short ha probably
0	no no pause dur short more to the point not being able to not managing to make it to where i was planning on making it
0	yes pause dur short ah there s a couple down there but ah they might be disabled
0	yeah
0	not sure those dungarees a good look
0	what
0	yeah there s loads along here
0	i didn t notice the t shirt pause dur short i was trying to avoid hitting them
0	the the the friend yeah the friend of the girl in the dungarees
0	that ll do
1	talking of uruguay
1	yeah
1	you know i go the erm pause dur short anon type place the gym
1	oh i used to be a member there i didn t know that you were a member no
1	yeah oh yes yes
1	oh right okay
1	and the other day i went in and i looked at the pool you know you can see the pool in from the reception
1	yes yes
1	and you couldn t see the water
1	why not
1	cos huge guys in there i mean they were triangular these blokes
1	oh right
1	enormous blokes
1	right
1	and i came into the we were all taking showers so i thought what language are they speaking
1	and
1	and i thought this it s kind of latinish
1	mm mm mm
1	you know latin unclear i thought unclear are they romanian but they came out and heard a bit more and they were speaking trunc span trunc er latin american spanish and i worked out that they were two uruguayans and they were rugby people but the fact it turns out that they re not the main uruguayan rugby they re the under twenty ones
1	oh and they re over here touring as well are they
1	that s right that s right
1	well well well
1	they must have a there must be a corresponding
1	yes there could well be erm pause dur short because uruguay s population is tiny it s like wales you know it s only three million or something like that i mean the fact that they won the world cup at football twice
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i mean i know it was before the war and everything but
1	yes but none the less
1	to won it twice and to have won it in brazil as well bet there re still elderly brazilians who remember that date
1	oh yes vocal desc laugh that s right the poor goalkeeper
1	mm
1	alright so the er pause dur short the way groups are and the way the points are awarded
1	mm still everything to play for
1	what would wales need to do to just need to beat australia
1	if we beat australia it doesn t matter what england do because we would ve won every game pause dur short but if australia beat england pause dur short england can t qualify as as i remember rightly
1	is this
1	they only have one game left they can t possibly get as many points then as wales
1	is it the case that wales have only got one game but england have got two games left
1	yes england have got to play australia on saturday not not tomorrow no sorry it is tomorrow it is tomorrow and then they have to play another game trunc i trunc i think that must be uruguay
1	uhu
1	i don t think they ve played uruguay so it must be uruguay i think erm pause dur short yeah
1	one two three four five
1	it s four games they have to play
1	so four games five unclear
1	it s five in a group pause dur short so who s in it wales australia england uruguay and fiji
1	fiji
1	okay well
1	i suppose there s no chance of getting er ticket for either the australia game or the er semi final if they get through is it unclear
1	quarter final
1	quarter final
1	would be after this erm no i don t even know where the erm trunc th trunc wales wales australia is at twickenham that that ll be sold out i don t even know where the quarter final if if it if wales get to is being played
1	were it to be at the millennium does your debenture help you at all
1	no no this is run by an entirely different trunc com trunc company erm if it were under the pause dur short if wales were running the world cup and we were the host nation then i think
1	oh because we re not the host nation
1	then i think tickets would go to debenture ticket holders on a first on a first choice basis
1	right right pause dur short right
1	but although perhaps unfairly wales have had pause dur short two games in the millennium stadium pause dur short when
1	even though they re not co hosts
1	no they re not co hosts er well
1	that is unfair then isn t it
1	well i totally i think i know what the answer is england wanted the world cup and they need to garner support
1	oh so okay pause dur short so this ll unclear both from
1	so i think this was done this this was done a deal well we ll vote for you to have the world cup
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but obviously we ll want a few games played at the millennium
1	sure sure
1	now wales wanted to play australia at the millennium
1	right
1	but er the english organisers wouldn t have that
1	okay
1	in fact er gatland the welsh manager actually teased the english and said
1	ah right right
1	if you think you re so good why don t you come and play us at the millennium stadium
1	vocal desc laugh ah yeah right right
1	and they wouldn t it would have been naive to have gone for that bait vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh yes quite pause dur short yes that s unclear
1	so no
1	it s a loss even though they played at twickenham unclear
1	well yes but i wouldn t want to play that game again because i
1	it was pretty nip and tuck
1	yeah and erm i think there is a sense in which probably england lost it more so than wales won it
1	unclear pause dur short well certainly at the end when they did that but then you know unclear
1	yeah i like i thought it was a courageous thing to do and and he d be a national hero if if it had come off
1	yeah yeah unclear as well
1	i think i think the really big mistake was throwing to the front of the line out which means you re only five yards from the touchline the welsh forwards just piled in and drove them over then and then it was a throw in to wales play out time game won you know pause dur short but the this saturday tomorrow
1	mm mm
1	england can t afford to lose they re out i think if they lose tomorrow pause dur short and i should be praying to a god
1	vocal desc laugh
1	to a god i don t believe in
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i shall be singing
1	well temporarily you might believe just for the sake of
1	singing singing in the praises of the australians yeah pause dur short and erm i shall be trunc g trunc you know getting all the voodoo stuff all the
1	yes yes
1	anything anything that ll get
1	that s right
1	you know the er the right result
1	unclear that s right
1	yes exactly
1	though watching it is of course pause dur short er exciting in in part but we ve had this conversation before pause dur short the stoppages and the impenetrability of the rules
1	ah pause dur short i know pause dur short i don t enjoy watching rugby as much as i did in the seventies pause dur short mind you that that trunc wa trunc i was biased by that wonderful welsh team in the seventies
1	yes sure sure
1	but it it it s become a much more confrontational impact game
1	true
1	you find three quarters now a lot of the tactics are about how can you break attack
1	yes yes yes
1	and go through rather than how can you go around the man
1	yes that s right but
1	i can t remember the last time i saw a genuine sidestep
1	that s right yes well surely they happen but very occasionally
1	no pause dur short yeah yeah but erm
1	i think but there is that issue about the lack of flow which is
1	yeah
1	games which flow are much more attractive the other thing i suppose is pause dur short your trunc sen trunc my sense the activity looks arbitrary
1	mm
1	it s only the scrum to somebody coming fresh to a game they see people hunkering down that way it looks completely arbitrary
1	yeah
1	why that way of distributing the ball why seven men rather than two or eight or twelve
1	take eight men each in a scrum yeah yeah pause dur short erm i don t know the history of that erm pause dur short i mean in rugby league for instance it s not it s not eight men
1	sure
1	it s it s six and the scrum s just become a way of restarting the game
1	it is it s a forward it s a forward
1	it s not even contested anymore the scrum in rugby league
1	that s right and that makes the game flow
1	it does yeah
1	it doesn t look arbitrary it s a way of restarting so
1	i mean uh and in some respects although i m not a huge fan of rugby league whenever i watch it i i find the games more satisfying to watch in some respects
1	sure unclear
1	i i don t have the emotional interest unclear
1	no sure sure it s just a game but it unclear
1	but as something to watch yes i quite enjoy i i think rugby has become far too technical
1	yes
1	there are far too many pause dur short mistakes trunc so trunc sorry not mistakes far too many technical infringements that are either a half penalty or full penalty
1	that s right
1	and games are being decided by referees interpretations of the laws and goodness knows what else you know
1	right pause dur short that s right and interpretations which are divisible or intelligible to most people in the trunc aud trunc in in the audience
1	i mean there s one
1	not even visible there s
1	no
1	say something will happen in some very very close engagement which you can t see and only the people on the field can see so it s unclear
1	i don t think referees don t understand half the time what is going on in the front row
1	unclear i don t i don t unclear
1	and there s one rule there s one rule it s a full penalty i think if you don t bind properly right
1	yeah
1	if you don t bind properly so the the hooker is in the middle he has to bind properly on his props and his props have to bind properly on him and they can t do certain other things but then the more i think about it well if you re not bound properly then you can t be as effective pushing forward as a scrum unit so if you don t want to bind properly let them get on with it
1	that s true yeah
1	why why why issue a penalty for not binding properly
1	presumably a lot of other things in the scrum aren t just about technicalities but about safety
1	some of them are about safety which is why they don t allow them to clash anymore because often when they allowed them to charge in they d go down and you d you d you could get people with snapped necks and things like
1	unclear anyway
1	yeah they do but now they
1	unclear frightening when you see them
1	i agree but now when they tend to go down that way pause dur short but you know
1	well there is still a safety element to pivoting
1	trunc whi trunc trunc whi trunc which is why you can t have contested scrums unless you ve got specialist props and hookers playing they won t allow it if if for any reason you haven t got erm you ve got an injury and you haven t got a specialist sub who s prop to come on to replace the injured prop the scrums must be uncontested
1	well who would decide that
1	well it s decided
1	if someone is qualified or trunc disqualify trunc unqualified
1	well it s it s known if someone is a prop yeah
1	okay yeah okay it s known
1	just like just like when you look at the bench in football you know that s the goalkeeper
1	oh right he or she s wearing something unclear
1	you know it it it it s clear who is a prop or not
1	well if it s a huge bloke unclear
1	no no no no you must of played as a prop you know
1	okay
1	in your career you can t you can t suddenly be a big bloke who s pressed into service
1	okay right
1	not at not at the elite level rugby anyway
1	well again that s that s you know
1	but it s frustrating because you pay a lot of money to go and see it and the number of times a scrum is reset and then it s reset and then the referee ll say no that was an infringement that s people slipped and then he ll move it five yards left or right you know and you re thinking hang on that s two minutes of my playing time that s gone by there you know so i do find it immensely frustrating
1	true true
1	and and as yet they haven t found an answer to it
1	it might well be i don t know what it s like watching club rugby probably it s very unpopulated but if it wasn t for the nationalisms involved and the long history of glamour in some senses of the word
1	mm
1	then rugby wouldn t have the same prestige that it has now
1	no i think that s right i mean if you look at new zealand particularly new zealand and to an extent wales it is the national expression of their of their culture in some respects or part of their culture
1	yes sure pause dur short sure sure
1	because particularly in new zealand it s the only game they really care about
1	that s right
1	in wales football is getting stronger and stronger which you know which worries the rugby
1	true pause dur short it s a secularise football
1	fraternity
1	it s a not a nationalistic even though they re happy when the national team does well cos it s very unusual
1	yeah
1	but it s it doesn t it s not so holy as the rugby is it s more unclear
1	no but no it isn t it but the problem i think er anon nametype m type name is that young boys and girls they see the bales of this world
1	yes
1	they see swansea playing against
1	sure sure
1	city and chelsea and all those and they grow up more likely to become good football players and not rugby players and
1	yes
1	we need we need youngsters coming through into rugby and and the other thing too is that i don t know swansea perhaps get twenty five thousand watching a game down there on a saturday pause dur short you you
1	yeah yeah yeah pause dur short but against neath you
1	no no pause dur short you d get hundreds you know if you re lucky
1	trunc o trunc of course in a sense pause dur short something like rugby and wales is er immune to that and the idea of rugby in wales
1	mm
1	the nature the symbolic element of rugby in wales
1	yeah vocal desc misc
1	it it would still survive as this symbolic thing whether anybody played it or not more or less just like hurling i suppose
1	yes it it would survive for quite some time but we might become you know distinctly second or third class at it erm and eventually then it would it would it would go under because you wouldn t be able to trunc sust trunc
1	yes
1	and we ve only got four professional clubs as it is
1	that s true
1	and our best players would end up having to play abroad and even if abroad was in england you know erm
1	mm
1	there s a big difference between having your best players playing in wales and having them as kind of a diaspora which is what the south sea islanders have found
1	well you know unclear that s right that s right
1	they can t keep their very best players in
1	unclear of course they can t
1	cos they re they re too poor you know
1	but some cultural icons don t pause dur short it s helped if there s quote success for them
1	yes yes
1	but it doesn t sum up well maybe rugby is not the same but say something like the gaelic language for example you don t need to have that many people speaking it for it to be
1	no
1	still be culturally important
1	it can be culturally important but er you take gaelic for instance and it s virtually dead
1	it s dead
1	it s virtually dead
1	it s an academic language
1	whereas i think i think more preferable would be for it to be this symbolic cultural icon and be a living entity
1	yeah unclear that s right that s right unclear
1	if you see what i mean and wales can t rest on its
1	laurels
1	rugby trunc roo trunc laurels really
1	no no okay
1	erm it needs to keep attracting young people into the game as as with the case for any sport of course
1	but didn t it survive in the sense of popularity and prestige quite a long time in well the last ten years of pretty dismal international
1	well as soon as it went professional which was what the late in the nineties wasn t it i think we had a very torrid time you know we were losing more matches in a season than we were winning erm pause dur short and we there were some pretty heavy defeats i mean there was a tour to south africa where i think south africa beat us ninety nine points to nil or something like that
1	what vocal desc laugh
1	and it took a while wales were slow to come to grips with professionalism and during that time it virtually destroyed a very healthy club system
1	right right
1	and what came in place there used to be five regional teams now and then there were four and there was all the squabbling and there was the renaming and all the rest of it and i don t think the welsh rugby union was particularly well led and there s the usual tribal conflicts in wales and places like france and england just marched ahead if us scotland struggled enormously too
1	well france and england would ve had more capital more pause dur short investors willing to capitalise unclear
1	it s more sponsorship er and there s just more money so you can pay the better then you can pay well
1	unclear pause dur short yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	yeah
1	but in spite of that dip
1	they come out i mean in in starting in two thousand and five they did the grand slam they hadn t done it for a long time
1	mm mm
1	and they ve they ve won the championship and had more grand slams since then so the last ten years has in some respects been you know the best ten years they ve had since the seventies pause dur short you might not call it well i don t know they might become known as another golden period i mean
1	unclear
1	who knows but it they have been very successful and of course erm four years ago they came within an ace of getting in the final of the world cup
1	mm mm mm mm
1	you know erm and but
1	but those things matter for keeping pause dur short keeping the flame burning as it were it would burn
1	yes yeah
1	unclear anyway but it ll flare up if the the team is successful on the pitch
1	trunc pe trunc people were immensely proud of what wales did in the last world cup you know it was it was played in the southern hemisphere it s tough to go there anyway and we came within a whisker of getting to the final i don t think we would ve beaten new zealand but you know we we came within a whisker of getting there
1	mm
1	and people were enormously proud of that erm pause dur short and they want they want wales to get out of this group you know
1	yeah that ll be unclear that s right that s right
1	going out at the group side yeah yeah pause dur short that s right pause dur short and if if we win it
1	well the
1	if we no if we win the group
1	unclear oh the group oh
1	no if we win the group
1	then you re guaranteed a less bad opponent than otherwise
1	yeah more likely people that we can beat
1	right
1	you know the
1	right
1	the the scotlands or the not that they ll be easy but the scotlands or the france or the irelands and we don t have to play
1	unclear pause dur short yeah new zealand that s right
1	new zealand in the quarter finals someone like that you know
1	is it not already decided who
1	it is decided it s it s like er the winner of group a plays the runner up in some other group but i i don t know i d have to look it up in the paper pause dur short yeah
1	yes so it s
1	but that is all because i do know that if england win the group pause dur short i d go so far as to say they re virtually guaranteed a place in the final
1	given that they that the comparative property
1	they ll play at twickenham and you know they will they trunc wi trunc they ll look at a team like france or ireland or scotland whoever it is and think we can beat you you know
1	that s right that s right that s right that s right
1	yeah
1	although who knows you know erm
1	well it would be wonderful for the non
1	vocal desc laugh
1	for the non english among us so to speak who who who never fail to enjoy the hubris and the schadenfreude
1	this is a
1	of an english defeat
1	almost equally as important as pleasure in your own team winning isn t it
1	almost trunc i trunc i shall be a very very happy man tomorrow if if australia beat england pause dur short i should be exceptionally happy
1	vocal desc laugh that s a good index of what these things mean isn t it that another team you take
1	yes
1	as much pleasure in almost
1	yeah and yet when it comes to world cup football and england are playing i don t know italy
1	mm
1	i i really don t care very much you know
1	exactly that s right yeah
1	if anything if anything my idea of heaven is brazil playing like gods and winning it
1	that s right vocal desc laugh
1	but that was shot to pieces in the last world cup
1	yes yes quite
1	i mean trunc bra trunc brazil can t even play the beautiful game any longer
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	you know what what is the world coming to
1	they can barely play the game by by all accounts
1	and today s paper say that wales are eighth in the world in football which i find staggering and brazil are seventh now brazil seventh and wales eight or eight or nine whatever it is
1	yes yes
1	no no no no there s something wrong there
1	that s right that s right
1	that can t be right
1	yes on the basis on the coefficients they use
1	well yes but i think that s just you know lies statistics and all the rest of it
1	well alright okay and it is managed by fifa and you might want to say well okay that will tell you
1	yeah yeah
1	what it all means
1	yes indeed
1	well good a good bit of footy watching and rugby watching over the weekend
1	yeah there s more european qualifying stuff coming up isn t there for the football
1	oh that s pretty dire though isn t it
1	well i don t i don t know wales i know need one point to be sure of qualifying and
1	oh right oh that s good
1	yeah that will be first tournament they ve trunc qualifor trunc qualified for since nineteen fifty eight
1	fantastic
1	well it s fantastic for the football fans but from a rugby point of view
1	well alright okay
1	you know yeah
1	it has this negative possibility of taking over
1	yeah yeah
1	who have they beaten in their group or who have they met in their group
1	well i don t know they re playing the likes of montenegro aren t they
1	okay right
1	but but i think they beat belgium and something like that
1	wow
1	who or drew with them or beat them at home they ve got some good results amongst it you know
1	right but this is one of the first or the first time that the european championships
1	yeah it s been expanded hasn t it yeah
1	it s been expanded to pause dur short mm thirty six rather than thirty four or something unclear like that
1	i ve i ve no idea but it s pause dur short but that s why you get things like germany versus erm monaco or germany versus san marino or something like that i mean it s
1	i think there there s always been those things but there are more of them now
1	there are more of them now cos you get the faroe islands and gibraltar and all the rest of it as well
1	the the faroe islands vocal desc laugh unclear
1	oh are they are they a world cup
1	they re surprisingly okay
1	oh yes they re eleventh in the world cup rankings aren t they
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes
1	well you may laugh but they beat the netherlands can you believe it
1	i do find that difficult to believe
1	unclear they do
1	er erm this was
1	i mean they re the new middle class comparatively
1	oh
1	but the the seriously not middle class are the uzbekistans of this world
1	ah
1	they re in there as well so i mean unclear
1	oh goodness me i i
1	it s extraordinary
1	i can t keep pace with it really but there we are
1	that s right
1	have a good weekend
1	same to you
1	and erm
1	oh before we go
1	yeah
1	er well i ll turn this off because
1	right
1	i was going to say
1	we must have about getting on for half a dozen recordings
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	unclear
0	unclear single word after unclear
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh what right okay think of some big word that you know then
0	mm mm
0	unclear exponential grows so there you go i m not an idiot
0	so like every day five new words ll come up and if they re already in my vocabulary if i already know what they mean i click on them and say i know what these mean and give me some more
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	and really basic ones as well so for basic for me would be saying like a you know the song don t look back in anger by oasis yeah
0	yeah
0	and it uses a chord progression on the one four five six with a trunc min trunc with a minor two and you wouldn t have a clue if that was right and it wasn t right
0	i can fill you full of bullshit all day and you wouldn t know it s unclear
0	yeah they all use the same music notes alright
0	vocal desc laugh
0	it sort of yes i don t know how to play a trumpet or trombone cos they re all you have to have skill unclear but what i do know is that erm on a trumpet it s not like a guitar where you can stroke like a six finger guitar you combine all the notes together to make a chord to play trumpet you can play one note you can t play a chord
0	okay right
0	yeah unclear the chord or whatever er and that s that s how er that s how you play a chord but i didn t know that when i unclear play off unclear but no if i ever played trumpet i d know straight away you can t do this this and this you can do this this and this er i can play guitar and because i can play guitar i can play bass violin cello all that sort of stuff to a certain standard
0	right
0	it gets really boring after this but
0	possibly possibly yes cos like erm the the easier you do it the four four rock beat which is you using everything yeah it does you count four on your high hat which is the symbol yeah which is one two three four on the one you press your kick pedal
0	that s an interesting theory i know loads all about the theories
0	i know but i m trying to like con my dentist into thinking that i need a brace for free because
0	vocal desc laugh
0	unclear leave the house
0	when people whenever i ve said that people are like oh do you think you re clever do you well it s like no no no i think what you ll find is my mouth is just stupid
0	you know exactly what you re on about and you re like how are you not getting it
0	you you unclear stuff like me
0	yeah balloon
0	vocal desc laugh their house unclear live there for free and erm they had new windows fitted about well well i say two months ago but actually my first week at uni cos i had i can remember coming home
0	because like
0	like so i ve purposefully not had
0	really
0	they snap their neck er they like fly into the window snap their neck and end up on the floor
0	i remember once at my house where a bird had flown through the window so it s inside my house we were unclear just unclear sat like watching tv or summat it had flown straight through house and then into patio doors which were shut at back smacked into patio doors at back and just like fell on the floor not dead
0	i er i do you know what pigeons are so weird though when they die i can remember when i was when i were about twelve or thirteen there were
0	unclear unclear thinking about it unclear vocal desc laugh
0	i wouldn t know cos windows aren t like unclear you can t vocal desc laugh you can t have a window that gets hurt by you throwing a brick at his eye vocal desc laugh
0	unclear ah you you horrible person you must think i m a right unclear little unclear unclear don t ya unclear
0	unclear
0	so you never got excluded
0	i ve been stabbed before with a pencil as well in the back of my arm unclear
0	right
0	bone vocal desc laugh
0	summat like summat along the lines of that yeah and she was like ah so who here who here unclear she said like unclear she goes anon nametype m type name do you unclear and he
0	vocal desc laugh
0	like when you do you used to see them unclear at school unclear
0	yeah we did like three weeks in it so it was like you go there
0	so i used to be in tas
0	and when i were a kid i was unclear
0	yeah
0	unclear vocal desc laugh it was like that much unclear it was like probably that much to there of like an arm so he s got like that much in her like proper
0	yeah yeah
0	really
0	so she
0	like just turning sixteen when she left school
0	remember exactly but summat like i ll google it erm cos there were loads of shit about it and his name was
0	what school did you go to
0	yeah no i remember that i saw it in erm it were a few years ago that happened but a few weeks ago it were on internet about it
0	anon nametype m type name yeah
0	a couple of years above us
0	he should not have got done for that
0	i know a load of people from school i ve hear all sorts of different accounts yeah from what i can gather is that he helped put her in a class cos i know who it was it was a girl called anon nametype f type name whose sister
0	i don t know
0	for yeah unclear
0	but he s bumped into her and like said oh how you doing oh yeah so he knows her and that he knows that she s underage he knows that she s seventeen
0	why did you unclear where d you live
0	anon type place
0	see i trunc wo trunc
0	so he had child porn like what do you mean child porn like
0	yeah like pictures of young girls getting fucked and stuff
0	but the girl obviously they re not gonna name her but the girl was called anon nametype f type name and now she s married to him she s called anon nametype f type name
0	very interesting
0	unclear like sort of thing but not thought anything of it but he said he realised that the unclear she might have been like you know getting ready to go see him or summat
0	and er yeah
0	shit
0	i think she moved school in sixth form or summat which you would
0	until
0	i was there when we found out yeah because er it was anon nametype f type name who got who got her phone she was like i m just gonna send a text off it we were sat there looking at her pictures going like oh look at these like you would you were like what the fuck unclear we unclear were like sixteen fifteen we would have been fourteen or fifteen at the time on this army trip
0	i m right you know better right when i were fifteen if i d have slept with a guy who was twenty one twenty two whatever whatever
0	and the men are always older
0	but why is that not wrong
0	nowadays it s not the same is it
0	yeah
0	because some of it is hard to trunc pro trunc er prosecute and testify against because you had like these rock stars like mick jagger yeah shagging fourteen fifteen year old girls who were throwing themselves at him and unclear like on please fuck me sort of thing
0	yeah like it were consent it were consentful
0	grooming them
0	yeah
0	three dads
0	he s been a dad to me and he was young he s six years younger than my mum so his trunc gran trunc his parents are my grandparents but they re only like in their fifties early sixties so
0	yeah but they re not they re not really grandparents
0	no
0	yeah
0	yeah yeah
0	blah blah blah exactly
0	and i was just like well you were right and that
0	it s really interesting
0	do you know what i really fucking hate i really fucking hate the fact that say like all these people out of coronation street erm ken erm that other guy erm
0	it s not fair is it
0	no it s william roache who plays ken
0	william roache yeah that s it who plays ken
0	michael
0	michael
0	no
0	and what the fuck do the media care about it
0	you ruin someone s life so what yeah yeah
0	but how much is
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
1	to check out the potential sources of money and how much they might provide
1	yeah
1	one of which obviously is your own money the lottery fund
1	mm
1	landfill community fund
1	mm
1	local government and kind of unclear reject stuff unclear although that s fairly difficult at the moment they will come back again
1	yeah
1	and the diocese
1	yeah
1	and a lot of diocese have the means one way or another if they really think you are a good cause to put some money up in one way or another
1	mm
1	so i think you have to test all of those out unclear oh and the last one is i think you have to find out where other people have got their money from other churches other similar projects how much were they able to get from where and if that s also open to you
1	yeah
1	erm but there s an awful lot just again i mean it is the same thing people here that won t stay with the project in anon type place or anon type place have put up five million pounds so why can t we
1	yeah
1	well because you can t
1	no
1	you are not at that church in anon type place that s a one off
1	yeah
1	it will happen once in a generation that some money is unclear
1	yes
1	so they need to find out what is a realistic thing
1	yeah
1	and what they realistically think they could raise from those sources
1	yeah
1	and that has to be there because otherwise you do what you have done they ve done at anon type place which is start with the architect so the architect thought what kind of dream can i build here
1	yes
1	what iconic building well iconic buildings cost ten times as much as non iconic buildings
1	mm
1	so you actually have to have enormous pragmatism because the people who are going to fund you if it is outside funders are going to do the sums and say why should we pay you a thousand pounds a square metre to put in a community centre when these people down the road can do it for two hundred pounds a square metre
1	yes
1	let s go with the ones down the road and then we can build five centres for the price of your one
1	yes unless you have got a grade one listed building and everybody agrees that no matter what it costs it has to be preserved because this is such an important national treasure which
1	well that s preserving it which comes from a different cause than adapting it
1	yes
1	because now there is much better funds than when we started for preserving listed places of worship
1	yes but as long as they are exceptional i mean even anon type place which is in the top six thousand or what have you it is not exceptional
1	no but it gets
1	the world wouldn t end if it somebody knocked it down
1	it could get grants if it wasn t a bit of a pig s ear in terms of who was applying for the money if the parish would apply for the prepare money they d get money straight away
1	mm
1	from the heritage lottery fund as a place as a listed place of worship but the bricks get treated as an oddity when they do it and that s because and the parish are silly silly they don t understand that this is what keeps them there some of those one or two who were on the pcc when i was working there unclear anon nametype f type name but some of the others were just mad
1	i know some of the new ones just absolutely don t understand and you do a feel bit like unclear or something when you sort of say well back in nineteen eighty and you see them sort of thinking to themselves well so what and then in way i think to myself i am trying just because something went wrong like that in nineteen ninety it actually doesn t mean to say that it will go wrong like that again in two thousand and fourteen
1	no but what you are dealing with is the fact that because it has gone so badly wrong
1	yeah
1	and so much money was wasted there wasn t a single grant maker of the trust and foundation who would ever give it money
1	no
1	because i approached them all i approached a hundred and none of them would give us any money not a penny
1	oh really
1	you didn t know that did you
1	no i didn t
1	i just realised you didn t
1	no
1	and that s because the track record there was rubbish
1	yes
1	they had had all the money and they had wasted it
1	yeah
1	so why would you give them any more
1	yeah and also going back through the history now and reading a lot of the archive materials there are from the the people who were around who were responsible for that particular phase of history their rhetoric they were going round unclear na na na unclear you know you know you ve got to get us money because we are this because we are that because we are doing blah this is we re of the people and this is you know this is going to be a really successful project and they ve got to give us the money and if they don t give us the money then you are a rapist or you are whatever
1	but that s fairly
1	and all that sort of stuff
1	it is the same kind of waffle
1	yeah
1	that we were getting to which we said no
1	yeah but the letters i saw a whole series of letters to unclear from this one particular individual which er how dare you be a traitor to our unclear net unclear group i am not giving you money and stuff like this i just thought oh well that s a really good way to get money from people
1	wasn t that the past manager
1	yes
1	he was bent vocal desc misc
1	yeah but then the vicar was one of the vicars was mad one of the vicars is now a hermit in anon type place the official hermit at a church in anon type place vocal desc laugh or at least he was five years ago i am trying to track him down the other one is still a radical campaigning vicar in anon type place
1	how weird
1	i know
1	one the one who was there when they got the money from central government to adapt the building is dead
1	oh right
1	so yeah there were obviously others
1	yeah
1	but yeah it is that same thing of all bluster
1	yeah
1	that doesn t work
1	no
1	i put it in i did a second article a second column because of being away on holiday about churches whose income doesn t meet their projected expenses and i put in it emotive or passion of exhortation doesn t make people change their giving because they used the passion of exhortation
1	mm
1	in advertising and they don t buy everything from everyone who gives them the old the story so it is not going to work when you ask people to reconsider their church giving
1	no
1	what you actually have to give them is the considered and careful
1	yeah
1	presentation about the real cost and their a recommended level of giving for people to think over for themselves
1	yes
1	and i think that passion of exhortation is one of our worst enemies
1	yes well actually if you when you watch channel is it channel with those adverts all the time for anon type place where and various other charitable ads that they put on they set out to make you feel absolutely dreadful that you don t give them money and they just they pull they have the music they have the voice over they have pictures of children on their death beds and stuff like that and you just think god i must be a bastard that i am not actually giving them two pounds a month
1	unclear
1	and if you watch any amount of channel you could see that four times a day
1	can you
1	with this piece of music and these pictures of dying children and stuff like that
1	it s rubbish
1	and you do feel god i must be hard
1	i don t know if they
1	hard for not
1	still stuck with it but about fifteen years ago christian aid made the decision that erm pause dur long they would not use dying children in pictures they would only use happy children
1	mm
1	and it goes along with an ad that was around a long time ago for a donkey sanctuary
1	oh right yes
1	and basically there was a skittish donkey in a paddock kind of kicking its heels up and their their brand their line was make sad donkeys happy and apparently they got more response than could ever be expected from that
1	oh
1	there were several styles to advertising and unclear what you did unclear like you never put a vicar on your fundraising leaflet because they are not seen as heroes they are seen as idiots
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and stuff like that but i mean i ve translated it to that because people give to the rnli
1	yeah
1	not because of the stupid sailors that get drowned but because of the heroic seaman
1	yes
1	so if you put a seaman going out to rescue them in his sowester and the rain pouring down in buckets on his head then people will give money because he is a hero
1	mm
1	but if you showed the sailor drowning they would say you stupid bugger why would i give you any money all that stuff so you actually have to know what you are doing and the the the vicar on the cover is rubbish
1	mm
1	that might have worked in the nineteen eighties
1	is that what about fat jolly smiling black lady vicars do they
1	a fat jolly black lady might work
1	mm
1	but i do tend to use small groups of friendly looking people on my stuff
1	mm
1	i think that picture we did at the unclear bricks or brits unclear was pretty good do you remember that folder we had
1	yes
1	with the whole
1	with the wedding on the working party on the back or if not wedding party
1	well it is not a wedding party i just moved everyone out onto the steps one sunday morning and took a picture of them all out there
1	mm
1	and made them wave at mast and i think that was good
1	mm
1	because that said a lot about our mix
1	oh yes now absolutely
1	unclear
1	just like a thousand words
1	exactly so er pause dur short no i think the erm the vicar s rhetoric is a deficit
1	mm
1	not an advantage
1	mm
1	you do need champions but you need ones that have definitely definitely got it all feet on the ground stuff who have your entire business plan up their sleeve
1	yes
1	erm and i can ask for money and get it on a face to face basis
1	mm
1	as well as through bids but i will only do it for projects where i think are good and good means they have been thought through and they are not going to fail them you are not going to put a million pounds in and then find in two years that it has gone
1	yeah what somebody else is reaping the benefit of it the first organisation actually hitting the decks as soon as they open the door
1	yes
1	because they haven t thought about what is going to happen when they open the door
1	exactly exactly
1	and somebody else inherits a lovely building vocal desc laugh that you ve spent all this money on well buys it for a
1	it happens
1	buys it for a song because erm pause dur long yes
1	but anyway so that part so i think that s the second stage
1	mm
1	is finding out how much money you might have available then you talk to the architect as if you are designing a new building and you say these are the needs we want to meet
1	mm
1	these are the actual needs we want to meet they are not hypothetical
1	yeah
1	they are real we want this is the kind of timetable we are running this is the size of groups that need to be in this is how long they will be in erm and etc
1	yeah
1	and this is the kind of money we could think we could possibly raise in order to do the work so can you start talking to us about how this might be designed
1	yeah
1	and an architect can always do it for less money
1	yes
1	i can never get anon nametype m type name to realise that at anon type place that in fact he had probably had reached the point where he needed to go to them and say look guys it has been wonderful dreaming about a four million pound project but we really need to be talking about a million pound project
1	mm
1	but that s what he needed to have said
1	yes
1	and i said it to him directly and indirectly in enough ways that he should have got the message but it was always off putting to set up a meeting with him and anon nametype m type name and then it was only him there
1	oh right okay because anon nametype m type name was too busy with something else
1	yeah but i think anon nametype m type name is the visionary and anon nametype m type name doesn t know he knows it is brilliant but he doesn t you can t adapt the vision if the vision is not there in the meeting
1	no
1	you see what i mean
1	yes
1	it s erm he hasn t got the access for making a decision like that
1	no
1	and if he goes off to see anon nametype m type name later and says we ought to do this he is not the visionary and it is not his job if you see what i mean
1	no okay
1	anyway that s another story so i think the last thing is to go to the architect and say this is what we need here s the kind of money you will have available to do it with
1	yeah
1	and even in a grade one church you could do that
1	yeah
1	you can have a modest servery that costs no more than it would in an unlisted building
1	yes
1	functionally it is exactly the same
1	yes
1	you might spend ten pounds more or you spend a little more on the external panelling so it looks suited to the building and you wouldn t have formica you would have to have to have wood but no
1	mm
1	it s not significantly different
1	mm
1	but i think the word i used is modest
1	mm
1	you want a modest adaptation in other words one that is not being designed not being done so that it can be iconic or aspirational or whatever else it is only a servery for heaven s sake or a toilet do you see what i mean
1	yes
1	so
1	so actually and also in that case that means the architect is just part of the scenario it is not oh look at this anon nametype m type name thing we ve got
1	mm
1	we actually don t want anon nametype m type name we don t want anon nametype m type name name on the front you want an architect who is a jobbing architect who thinks what do you need rather than somebody who like looking at iconic buildings thinking my name will be in lights i will be
1	exactly
1	in the architectural journal i will be
1	you want someone who will actually look at what you need and provide it
1	yes
1	even if there nobody can tell they have done their work afterwards
1	no
1	because it s so ordinary
1	yeah they need to be invisible actually when it s done
1	yeah
1	so it s not it s if it s not their
1	and that is fine
1	not their bloody building actually
1	well no it s not their building they think it is
1	yeah
1	one of unclear churches
1	yeah
1	erm and so i do get erm drama queens among the architects divas vocal desc cough who think it s theirs to decide
1	yeah
1	erm but it isn t
1	no
1	trunc i trunc when you get the younger architects you get a much better response
1	mm
1	it s the older ones who are now thinking of erm heritage no what s the word tut
1	er their erm pause dur short
1	yeah
1	their bequests their erm pause dur short
1	gift to the world
1	yeah their yeah it s not their inheritance it s the other way isn t it their erm
1	yeah anyway trunc whatev trunc you know the word i mean
1	yeah yeah
1	and i these words if i don t use them very often they do drift away these days
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm but once i ve remembered them i can hold onto them quite well
1	vocal desc laugh
1	sometimes it takes a day to remember them unclear
1	yes they sort of come to you in the middle of the night
1	erm yeah middle of the night stuff erm so you really don t need that kind of architect who s getting to the end of their architectural career and wants to leave their imprint
1	yeah
1	you really trunc nee trunc
1	legacy
1	a legacy yes that s right their legacy and erm tut that s a nightmare when they do that
1	mm yeah
1	and of course in the church sector a lot of practices that work with churches are that senior partner who wants to work on the grade one building everybody wants to work on a grade one building and leave something in it because they know it ll be there in four hundred years time oh there s what so and so did
1	yeah that s true that s true
1	well no sorry that s unclear
1	well there s a very interesting
1	we need to know we re like the victorian architecture which is ours won t last as long as this
1	no but er there was an article in the guardian yesterday where people have spatchcocked new bits onto old edifices so you know that little portico that s half way down anon type place there s the little doric
1	yeah
1	the little doric chapel entrance which used to be
1	yeah
1	the entrance to a school
1	yeah i know
1	the school s gone and they ve got a multistorey block of flats before but with this sort of white this white portico with doric
1	on the front yes that s right
1	yeah but unclear there unclear and then vocal desc laugh there s another church where actually the their church is like erm a sort of shortbread box for the building
1	yeah
1	that they ve put inside it
1	right
1	it s a bit like us i suppose but
1	there s one at anon type place like that
1	yeah there s one the same that s in anon type place so you ve got this glass thing shooting up out of this sort of carapace of victorian brick and you think oh there s something it s like having a monster behind you vocal desc misc like this but actually it s its own unclear
1	yeah unclear
1	and the article was all about do you know what keeping these bits for prosperity can be the wrong vocal desc laugh the wrong way of going unclear around unclear things
1	yeah there s one in er anon type place where they built totally self contained glass box
1	mm
1	a metre from the walls of the church
1	mm
1	on either side and it fits inside like a hand in glove
1	mm
1	and you can actually walk er entirely round the glass box
1	oh right
1	i don t know if they do that now i don t know how that architect worked that
1	no
1	it tends to be the criteria if it is reversible
1	yes
1	in other words you could take it out
1	yes
1	and actually that is not difficult to achieve at all
1	no no i don t know whether ours would be actually
1	well the stuff we have done would be
1	yes
1	but it is the stuff that the previous people did all that poured concrete probably wouldn t be
1	well i don t know apparently it is not pinned into the wall apparently it is just it is just sitting inside the case
1	oh right that s alright
1	which is why you have got drops in the windows
1	oh right
1	where you can actually see down but obviously you would just end up with an empty box unclear so i don t know whether whether you would want to have just a totally empty box in place
1	when that building was converted in the late seventies early eighties it didn t have a faculty
1	no but then
1	but it had permission to do it
1	no but then i ve heard from three different sources now about how the bishop was the bishop just had a i don t know some mental aberration of find a piece of paper and broke all the rules
1	he did he did he did
1	and broke all the procedures
1	he did
1	whatever and i mean i i am like the guy
1	i think it is that typical big thing that because of all the rioting in anon type place he felt obliged to do something
1	mm
1	and this vicar was exhorting and saying this is what needs to happen
1	mm
1	without any grounds for saying it
1	no but trunc als trunc well i mean it is the other thing as well they have the building
1	i know who the bishop was and that you are absolutely right it was the bishop s letter that gave permission they didn t go through any of the right processes and that s how they got permission to do it and actually the same bishop commented some fifteen years later on it would have been around the time we were working basically in those days we did a lot of things which with hindsight we wouldn t have done
1	it would be allowed today
1	it was totally the wrong way to deal with that building
1	but it was another building
1	unclear lift in the minute in the middle
1	yes
1	why wasn t it in one of those corner staircases
1	yeah
1	and then the building would have been much more adaptable
1	yes absolutely and you wouldn t have that disorientation you get when you go round and round and round you can t work out which way you are facing i still have people working for me it says north i go no south they have no idea in the building which way they are facing and you can t see out
1	yes
1	you know it is a bizarre really in that sense
1	it is bizarre
1	but erm pause dur short but er pause dur long
1	well it was a pig s ear
1	yeah
1	and we have made it a useable pig s ear but it is still a pig s ear it is never going to be a silk purse
1	no
1	it never was before it was started actually
1	no well on the inside it was very it was going to be very plain but as you said much much erm earlier in this conversation built for two thousand people so all these people replicated there oh yes we need space for two thousand but actually no we probably never needed a place for two thousand
1	no no unclear
1	never ever ever needed a space to two thousand
1	and if you go back to the numbers i know it was built for two thousand because the whole of anon type place was supposed to turn up to celebrate the battle winning of anon type place because of the anon type place church it never happened
1	no
1	and even though all the churches in anon type place even in that middle twentieth century would close and march from anon type place for remembrance sunday it still wasn t there weren t enough for even then to fill it
1	no
1	that was never ever full
1	no you trunc can trunc actually you can trunc see trunc you can see now going through all the old photographs as well that there s nobody ever sitting upstairs
1	no and there were so many churches i could find you around the country where the gallery is never used
1	yes and the galleries were just junk because there was nobody up there
1	oh absolutely always full of junk
1	and never ever been anybody up there and in fact actually when they converted anon type place the anon type place the church is still on the ground floor but their offices and all the
1	are all around the gallery
1	things that they ve left are the gallery blocked in
1	yeah
1	so the gallery was always disposable there as well not needed
1	yeah i know been there when they not so long after they had done it it was an awful long time ago
1	i still haven t got in there
1	it was shoddy
1	oh really i still haven t managed to get in there i will have to go i am going to have to go to church there or something one sunday to get in there to have a look it seems to be the only way to get in there and have a look i mean today you can t even find out who ruddy runs it vocal desc laugh let alone get in contact with them or
1	is there a vicar unclear online unclear
1	probably but i think we have tried i ve tried in the past to go round all of them and have a look in all of them and i managed anon type place and i managed anon type place but not ever anon type place
1	yeah
1	not that you can even park in there or anything
1	no it is a bit mad
1	mm
1	from what it has been through has been quite interesting
1	mm
1	that was the church which actually lost the arch deacon his job he was encouraged to retire where a bunch of clergy this is way off unclear i mean it may have been something when i reached being a vicar no it was after i was a vicar i heard on the grapevine they had a shortlist of candidates for being vicar there
1	mm
1	and erm pause dur long they said to the and they d interviewed them all and one of the members of the interviewing group said to the arch deacon we don t think we are ready for a black vicar yet
1	right
1	and the arch deacon then challenged them
1	ah
1	and he lost his job which he should have done
1	oh did he not think that he was in some kind of leadership role
1	i don t know what he was thinking he was a very nice guy in some ways i mean he was quite helpful to me when anon nametype m type name was being so shitty and he was the one who said to me go and see the bishop and the bishop was brilliant when i did see him but he had worked in anon type place over the years and had come out of it with that pause dur short general view that the unclear were simple black people if you know what i mean
1	mm
1	they haven t got the brains and whatever but of course they have
1	ah
1	anyway whatever it was he made the unclear remark go through well accepted it and may have even put it in writing and he accepted it and went with their candidate the white guy but you know it is like a church being able to say we don t think we are ready for a woman yet but
1	of well a lot of them
1	unclear
1	a lot of them feel they are able to say that now
1	well they aren t allowed to say it unless they ve already previously voted to go into the stream
1	oh i see
1	unclear of people unclear doesn t happen
1	right
1	you can only be in that category if you ve made a prior decision
1	right
1	which i still think is a bit of an old fudge is it worth it this is going to be interesting one of the most highly recommended people to be the first woman bishop in the church of england is black
1	i know
1	i know her quite well she would be quite good i mean she would as good as any other crappy male vicar i mean bishop i don t think she will be stunning in lots of ways
1	and what about anon nametype f type name thingy though
1	oh she wants it like the end of
1	yeah
1	they asked her in church the other day and she said i wouldn t even think about my own she said i am praying that they would choose the right person bloody hell does she want it
1	well i knew her when she was starting out i knew her in the early eighties in anon type place
1	in the anon type place yeah
1	yes
1	she might be i mean but i know there are a lot of women
1	she is nice and she is capable there s no reason why she shouldn t
1	she is nice and she is capable my only reason for her not having it is that she thinks she should
1	vocal desc laugh
1	she thinks she is the best i mean it is like the male clergy behaving like erm but anon nametype f type name is the black woman
1	oh right yes i ve heard her name
1	who really really well she is the queen s chaplain at somewhere and she s chaplain to the house of trunc c trunc i mean all sorts of stuff she has got into because she s really really well presented now incredibly well and i just really think it would be lovely for the church of england for their first woman bishop
1	i know that would be trunc a trunc yeah that would be superb wouldn t it oh my god what s the time my car is parked how strict are they with car parking now
1	if they turn up you will always get a ticket what time do you have yours till
1	two fifty three
1	we have got five minutes what do you want to do shall we go and put another ticket in for five minutes and then have a cup of tea before you go
1	okay i could do that couldn t i
1	because you can put in the shortest limit one
1	yes that s true
1	it might even be a sixty p one down there
1	yeah
1	you have got more than you ve got a lot of time on that
1	i know i stopped it and started it again when your phone rang
1	yeah
1	which erm pause dur short i am trunc just trunc what i am trying to work out is that erm they do it in units of fifteen minutes so whether twenty seven minutes it is not a half an hour or not but pause dur long
1	i can t remember how much an hour is vocal desc yawn how much is an hour is it sixty for an hour do you want some change i ve got some somewhere
1	have you got a pound s worth of change and then i can erm pause dur short i can just up toddle up there and pause dur long
1	i have a system now for when i go to anon type place
1	i am allowed to renew aren t i it is not one of those ones
1	no no no you just put the money in and get another ticket you don t have to go away pause dur long i will give you as much of it as broken down as much as i can and i do have an enormous collections of coins in a piggy bank
1	have you erm pause dur long actually what i need is another twenty p if you have got another twenty p
1	oh well that s alright
1	i will give you some
1	that s alright that will go in my piggy bank it is okay unclear
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they will all go in my piggy bank because every once in a while event desc abrupt end
0	yeah like actually no one s ever died from drugs
0	yeah no one s trunc e trunc it s all the pause dur short the thing is like with the stories about pause dur short people dying from ecstasy i always just think that s so stupid but now it s like that that is actually unclear
0	mm pause dur short i just thought like oh i bet they took like five or like
0	mm pause dur short i don t think it s everyone like vocal desc laugh
0	rat poison
0	she made you do it didn t she vocal desc laugh
0	really
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh unclear early
0	and then it s then you start cos yeah when i like come down from drinking
0	i start trunc i trunc if i leave it for like an hour erm then i can t anymore like i can t go back into the phase cos i suddenly feel awful
0	mm
0	yeah yeah so like
0	mm
0	even the word like drinking pause dur short fills me with disgust
0	it s like i m not like oh i m so like i m doing it for her but like her reaction when i was like oh i m drinking now it s like they actually want to have dinner with you whereas when you re not
0	no but
0	but that s what i mean it s like pause dur short i think also because i know that i really don t wanna take drugs
0	well unclear compromise
0	and pause dur short and then my psoriasis was like bad anyway in australia and i wasn t drinking pause dur short and then it was like well this is just ridiculous
0	also like apart from india like every culture does have a drinking culture
0	but you know er the other thing i think it is culturally is like if you pause dur short i was thinking if like if you re like the whole working thing
0	if you have two hours and you have a drink you get like to a deeper level a lot quicker in terms of like a friendlier level
0	i don t think it is from drinking i think it s from
0	yeah every time you drink er it drinking is like very mild brain damage every time you drink you your brain cells
0	yeah
0	you you know like if you re taking drugs your eyes go like big and you feel like
0	yeah you feel like yeah
0	yeah
0	you shouldn t do it
0	i m not gonna judge you vocal desc laugh no but pause dur short when i didn t drink apart from certain friends like anon nametype f type name
0	how is she
0	unless it s like in the day and it s obviously a time for a cup of tea but like you feel like a drag and you are a drag to everyone and it was just not fun for me cos i was like i always felt like i d have to like leave
0	and they trunc y trunc you can you can tell they re a bit like on edge
0	yeah and they feel judged but like pause dur short at the end of the day pause dur short like our society is fucked in those ways it s like such babylon and it s like yeah it means like a life of sitting inside and waiting till you meet those people who actually don t care and probably don t drink either but i just think like pause dur short like i get that feeling so much with people
0	and you get loads of questions like oh what do you wanna do now or like
0	or like like on friday night
0	yeah like on friday night
0	and they re like oh
0	yeah but what and that s so unclear
0	but instead we d like started drinking straight away and like pause dur short just like blurting everything out whereas like they re just like blurting loads of talk and then like crying and i think it s just like cos our society is quite emotionless like the trains like everyone is staring it s like you need that to like get out your emotions and like start again
0	but i think it depends because pause dur short like anon nametype m type name was saying his like great aunt she like drank a like cup of port every day a little cup if you re like someone who s like it s like pause dur short you know just like it s like almost like a hot chocolate in the evening that s different
0	yeah
0	yeah but i think mum mum s like drinks it habitually like with dinner but she s like mad like we went out it s like it was like five do you remember in chelsea we re having like hummus and she can t trunc s trunc like not blurt out that she needs a wine and then order one it s like
0	they did
0	sometimes like and they d always have a lot of wine with dinner and always
0	yeah but it is a poison
0	animals get animals like eat like fermented fruit and get drunk pause dur short or like it s not completely crazy
0	why you don t drink i know
0	but the thing is i don t
0	it s delusion it s not reality
0	oh well a lot more of like pause dur short beer s a much more natural process or like wine pause dur short that they ve been making forever and like pause dur short er like it s horrible like processed fats and like palm oil which is all like biscuits and stuff that s in biscuits that s why it s even though i was thinking like oh alcohol is so bad for psoriasis now i m like pause dur short there are loads of things that are inflammatory like oil erm vegetable oils which are really unnatural like palm oil and stuff which is in all processed food and you know how when i started my psoriasis diet it like went away and then as soon as i started eating like gluten free biscuits
0	it came back like even though those were gluten free and dairy free
0	yeah but it s different like but it s not just body abuse it s not like it s mostly not about body abuse it s about also just running away from reality
0	but what about like it s okay that s like yeah maybe
0	i know like the feeling of enhancing reality it s like it s not enhancing
0	you just you feel stupid
0	like obviously chocolate biscuits stuff that s not good either but i think drinking s like a serious evil and it has been like
0	yeah but so is india and they don t drink
0	yeah
0	it s not really eight is it
0	then i just end up going to bed
0	i know yeah but it s just
0	like i i understand like i just think it s really sad and i really i just think it s sad that it s literally it is every
0	no
0	it s boring cos you don t and trunc a trunc
0	no i do believe you but
0	yeah but maybe it s like society s pressure s like got to you
0	maybe you need
0	to get drunk vocal desc laugh
0	no that is true
0	but the thing is i just found like pause dur short you know like when i always like remembered like the gigs i went to when with anon nametype f type name and stuff and it was so fun
0	yeah
0	do you remember that you were drunk
0	yeah and then i remembered like well yeah we used to get drunk and like not really drunk but like have like two
0	in this yeah
0	and it s like basically
0	this society
0	it s unclear more fun unclear
0	that s the name of the game with all societies like take part in the masses even if you deep down know it s wrong or like be a the outsider and deal with like a more difficult life
0	being a vegetarian pause dur short it s like or even being a vegan it s like if you wanna have those values you will also have to realise you re gonna be er the one at the table
0	yeah and then i always feel like it s like
0	a chore for like for them to see you because you don t drink
0	yeah it s like they re it s like oh and a night of sacrifice and it s like
0	vocal desc laugh i know
0	trunc ye trunc yeah
0	bulging bellies
0	i m not that into it
0	unclear
0	yeah but i don t
0	yeah
0	yeah but that s not that controversial so obviously he d rather we re like hugging and like feeling depressed than like fighting and throwing up
0	like one time on acid can send you mad but i don t think one time drinking pause dur short like drinking is like yeah for a long time you could turn violent or like turn mad or whatever or dependent but i don t think it s gonna happen after like one beer
0	yeah weed could send you made after one
0	yeah anon nametype f type name does
0	see i don t think it s an ill
0	vocal desc yawn yeah i did but now i don t er
0	yeah i ve not
0	oh no i ve i m getting up early like i went yeah i went to bed at one last night and got up at like eight thirty this morning so that was good you know when you re like get you get like seven or eight hours but you don t overdo it
0	like india was erm and like yeah india is where we slept loads
0	yeah it was so hot
0	india and a year abroad would be my idea of hell
0	yeah but you re in india
0	no i think i can unclear get into it not easily but if you like get your head around it and you feel good physically i do pause dur short you feel like life
0	i think when you re in a hot place trunc th trunc you feel a lot healthier
0	i m so excited pause dur long
0	did he like doing it
0	it was really fun pause dur short we made a really cool one together

0	er foreign lang und
0	you need if you need to take the car you can take it
0	i m never gonna get that money back pause dur short erm pause dur short which brings me onto pause dur short something we were talking about yesterday in that pause dur short erm i wondered whether pause dur short you perhaps would like to buy a new car pause dur short using my car as part exchange pause dur short and then sell your car and just pocket the money pause dur short because you said to me basically yesterday that getting cars on finance it that would be the money you would put into savings for if you wanted to go away with your friends et cetera et cetera well pause dur short if you if you use the money that you got for your car and put it into a savings account
0	okay pause dur short let me try and work this out right we use both cars as a pause dur short deposit for one car
0	yeah maybe
0	what i was thinking is what you might be able to do is you know that fifteen hundred pounds you ve got that s kind of stashed aside at the moment pause dur short you could use that plus my car as a deposit and then put that money back in there pause dur short when you sell your car do you know what i mean so you d have like you d have over two grand as a deposit which means hopefully that would bring your monthly repayments down like a little bit
0	what freshly mot d
0	yeah it s but it s a selling point saying you know it s not gonna need a service or mot for another year like that s a really big selling point pause dur short erm pause dur short and you know like you probably will actually get more for your car with it being serviced and mot d cos people kind of trust it a little bit more pause dur long so i don t see it as a bad thing that it s about to go in for service and mot
0	well i haven t done any sums or anything this is just like me thinking off the top of my head i need to get rid of my car pause dur short put it that way pause dur short i d quite like the seven hundred quid however that comes do you know what mean pause dur long is this okay with bruises unclear or not unclear pause dur long can we watch a film tonight
0	and what about the unclear furniture unclear and stuff pause dur short forget it pause dur long
0	mm pause dur short yes pause dur short anon nametype f type name says all her friends have been a bit shit recently
0	really does she wanna come round
0	she basically said that was been she s obviously trying to ask her girls like her best friends erm to arrange like er drinks before she goes and like they basically all said they could only do thursday next week and now they ve all all but bailed and she s just like i don t think they understand i m like moving away like they don t seem to give a shit pause dur short and apparently she had a bit of a cry today about that
0	why s it yellow by the way pause dur short it s still hard
0	in that bag
0	they were around yesterday
0	your six months then
0	i need a personal development plan

0	but you need to have a serious think about what you wanna talk to him about
0	more money
0	yeah
0	what do you have to do for more money and actually it shouldn t even be that you should kind of go in there saying actually i was made permanent it wasn t i was made permanent and it wasn t even discussed with me like i think in the last year like i ve grown from strength to strength i i m now in charge of like one of our largest customers you know they re really happy with the work that i m doing for them on a on a day to day basis
0	can t say that
0	yeah
0	it s such a big thing and for them to just be like oh by the way now you re permanent and that that be it that s quite disappointing pause dur short you have to really like in your one to one
0	you should be allowed to fight your corner
0	and even if he turns around and says oh i can t offer you more at this point you say right okay well i wanna know that if i do x y and z i will get more money cos otherwise there s no incentive pause dur short and they know that they can t say right this is what this is how we think you ve fared over the last year your goals for the next twelve months are this and expect you to do it for no extra money that s not how it works pause dur long yes fighting face pause dur long but yeah all the
0	all the personal development stuff is obviously important for you as well pause dur short you can ask about all of that kind of thing pause dur long do you think he ll pick up on the fact that you re late quite a lot

0	er no it s not
0	vocal desc laugh
0	unclear i m on w unclear now
0	no nearly though one sec
0	dunno i see no difference really just apart from these i keep having to throw away so i m making more of a mess
0	not unclear all a unclear mess the unclear rest unclear is in the bin
0	yeah it is yeah pause dur short like all these tissues that i ve used
0	anon nametype f type name didn t say i think you re horrible to me
1	so anyway erm pause dur short so what i m hoping is that an extra unclear you will pause dur short unclear and used pause dur short erm well not only from anon type place but from other places and in other contexts if you were advising oh well so let s say anon nametype m type name and and and anon nametype m type name from
1	mm
1	anon type place what what would you say is unclear key things to be learned in setting up and running an initiative of this kind
1	mm pause dur short well i ll tell you what my starting point is
1	mm
1	one is knowing what you want to achieve and why
1	mm
1	so you have a perfectly good unclear vocal desc cough i think that pause dur short you and i had never written unclear this plan before
1	no
1	but we wrote a version of what a business plan then i thought was now i look back on it it was pretty good
1	mm
1	because we really tested the waters on everything and made sure if things could have that unclear on the income after it was done
1	yeah
1	and what we did that was pause dur short what was important is that we didn t start from the fact that we needed money pause dur short we started from the fact although undoubtedly we did we started to say how could this be a manageable pause dur short and workable pause dur short building
1	mm
1	that enough local people would want to use that it could actually we can actually say that it would be used unclear we ve done our work
1	yeah
1	and they would produce enough income to make it run because what was there before was pause dur short a building with high aspirations and no way unclear written all down would ve ever paid for itself
1	no
1	they set it up unclear
1	and it didn t
1	and it didn t
1	yeah
1	so pause dur short i think that research we did do you remember what we did the er draft business plan we put in i think we even had a photo pause dur short of every space that was left there
1	yeah
1	we gave unclear it a unclear page and under each one we missed it pause dur short the local people who d made inquiries to us about using enough space
1	mm
1	and that showed and we have three or four under some of them some of them unclear were unclear around by the time we finished the work
1	no
1	but then we were always one step forward saying we want to have a look at it
1	yeah
1	and we could then check out that each of those pause dur short that the bigger users pause dur short were going to be viable
1	yeah
1	and could actually pay us the kind of rent it needed to keep the building running
1	well yeah
1	so that was a really really good pause dur short first stage analysis of local need and demand
1	yeah
1	and checking that that could be added together to make a sustainable business plan pause dur short so pause dur short i remember our first projections of budget people like them those businessmen that came on board with us they would look at the whole business plan that they always started on the cash flow page even if it was the back page they d start at the back because they would work back from that to know if we d done our proper homework
1	yeah
1	which as it turned out we had
1	yeah
1	and so i think that that is the absolutely crucial first step we could ve said our aim was to get enough money to keep the building going pause dur short but that was pause dur short that s a by product of having a well run building
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short and from being manageable we were told that we didn t need a seven star unclear
1	i know
1	we structured it so that we could do it on one and a half
1	yeah
1	or one and three quarters cos we did end up with a pause dur short unclear some of the time
1	yeah
1	but we had a half time admin a full time manager and eventually some box office but the box office was actually paid for by our tenants
1	mm
1	primarily because they were the ones who needed people to unclear in and get a box office
1	yeah
1	so we actually minimised the things we pause dur short that were costing the most money which is unclear pause dur short and you have the doors and things and everything out in the building putting such a way that you could let full time in some spaces and occasionally on others and others you would rent it out the entire spaces
1	mm
1	erm and you know that that audit was the first thing that
1	mm
1	checking that the space was really needed and wanted
1	mm
1	and that people who were needing and wanting it i remember i was talking about the fact that we would have to check that each one of those was viable pause dur short and a lot of them we did i know
1	yeah
1	i know pause dur short when they came in you know erm the restaurant pause dur short was viable
1	it was
1	erm and they had put together their plan properly and we could see it was but the cinema wasn t
1	oh is that what happened i never worked out what happened to the cinema
1	what happened to the cinema was pause dur short two unclear faults unclear one the cost of construction of the cinema is pause dur short victoriously high because pause dur short er erm pause dur short the safety factors that you have to build in have never been updated from when the only cinema happened all over the country and they were working with unclear
1	oh it s just very flammable
1	and it was highly flammable so you had to all kind of protect that stuff when we could ve spent our entire budget on turning that main room the conference room
1	yeah that actually unclear
1	no it wouldn t we we
1	no
1	couldn t have done it it would ve cost too much
1	mm
1	to do it structurally
1	mm
1	and the insurance would ve been pause dur short er the trunc wor trunc
1	yeah
1	as well and it was a silly thing to do you have to prove your case when you ve got to anon type place across the road the business case was just not there
1	no
1	and it was when pause dur short i don t know how you whether you i remember having a long conversation to anon nametype m type name about this cos i was being called pause dur short racist because we weren t going to have the black cinema in pause dur short because it wasn t viable pause dur short and i said to anon nametype m type name pause dur short am i being racist pause dur short and he said pause dur short er no you re just looking at my business plan and saying it won t cut together and we never mentioned black in it and half of the others that are gonna come in loads of them are black and they presented
1	mm
1	a unclear case so
1	mm
1	it s got nothing to do with anything
1	no
1	but you will that is a card that people use if they want to make you flinch
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short so that s like being manipulated by basically was like he s saying so that side we pause dur short we had to check out each of our tenants could really pay
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short i think there was another church write help them look at their plans cos they had something like an after school club coming into their church hall pause dur short and erm their pause dur short grant from their local authority pause dur short to pay for the it was gonna be paid for by the local authority the letting was gonna be completely covered
1	right
1	and so i said to the church hall committee pause dur short whatever you do take the money in advance of their booking pause dur short about three or four years later they came to me said we don t know what to do the arts school club owes us twenty three thousand pounds
1	vocal desc misc
1	because they keep saying they re gonna pay their rent but they never do so we leave them in cos we keep hoping we ll get it
1	oh unclear
1	and of course it meant that they would never get it
1	yeah
1	so no you can t go there erm
1	aha
1	i don t of course they never did get it
1	yeah
1	what happened was the after school club spent their grant on all kinds of maths stuff
1	yeah
1	and not on paying the rent cos they re still in
1	yeah pause dur short there the trunc wor trunc trunc th trunc there s the worse group as well which i can t trunc re trunc unclear brave when you get so far stuck into something you can t pull out because pause dur short erm you ve already invested so much that
1	mm
1	unclear actually cutting off and losing your investment
1	mm
1	that s so prohibited
1	mm
1	that you just carry on and that s what we did with anon type place pause dur short cos that
1	completely
1	you just get to the point where you think pause dur short if you sell them out you ll never see that money again
1	well one of the lessons if i was gonna look at it i wasn t involved in the board at that point but do you remember in the early days pause dur short we had a set of unclear point of about pause dur short sixty percent let
1	mm
1	fifty three percent maybe
1	mm
1	if we were sixty three percent let we would pause dur short er cover all our costs
1	yeah
1	we never wanted to be a hundred trunc perce trunc we never wanted it to we had to have it all let
1	mm
1	and then we said we would trunc ge trunc never allow a single tenant pause dur short to have more than i think it was about sixty percent of the building
1	yeah
1	if we d have forty percent coming in from one tenant it would ve made a lot of difference but anon type place did get about ninety percent
1	yeah
1	of the building
1	yeah
1	and that that broke a rule we started with
1	i know it s actually in it s actually not unclear
1	mm
1	so erm trunc a trunc
1	and that i don t know where it came from but it was trunc a trunc
1	and that was too many eggs in one basket
1	it was trunc an trunc it was a piece of wisdom we had in the early days so we should ve stuck to it
1	and we lost it yeah
1	mm
1	and actually it was pause dur short we had to close that space and nobody s coming forward pause dur short and we had we were owed
1	i wonder what happened
1	oh hang on a second anon nametype m type name got introduced by anon type place didn t he by the
1	yeah
1	erm by the full proof base and then pause dur short because we got ourselves into the same issue again
1	mm
1	unclear er anon nametype m type name
1	mm
1	erm anon nametype m type name was standing there looking like pause dur short an angel pause dur short well who was going to rescue us and give us all this money pause dur short and was stepping there and then and start paying from tomorrow pause dur short and we thought do we do unclear today or do we do unclear tomorrow and we thought let s do unclear today cos you know unclear tomorrow might not be tomorrow it might be next week next month next year pause dur short erm and because we got ourselves into a mess again we just jumped up and
1	so those were all that we had at the beginning
1	yeah
1	if we d stuck to them we could ve made
1	yeah
1	the years much more comfortable
1	yeah pause dur short because that was the point at which he started thinking pause dur short that pause dur short that he should be turning unclear to do not vice versa
1	and erm trunc i trunc the main thing was at a default by one tenant
1	yes
1	it unclear the entire project
1	yeah pause dur short well he started
1	had he
1	he started unclear talking unclear to us pause dur short he wrote to me i i unclear pause dur short i m paying for all of this and therefore i should have the right to say pause dur short how it goes at it pause dur short that it s never been tangible
1	i heard that before
1	so erm pause dur short the
1	we set we set some interesting principles there that we should ve unclear to
1	mm pause dur short and would you say that pause dur short you have managed to persuade pause dur short all the other organisations at anon type place you ve worked with to take that kind of approach pause dur short and they have been reluctant
1	no
1	what happened that they wouldn t
1	i haven t managed to persuade them because pause dur short they all get into that moment like the enthusiastic terms unclear pause dur short he says i can do this and they tend to believe him
1	mm
1	they don t actually do pause dur short the thorough unclear
1	actually it was true that i pause dur short i don t know
1	no but
1	like an old unclear because pause dur short unclear no no no too good to be true and it couldn t come off that s not right that s not true pause dur short somebody s just turned up to him and said pause dur short we re running an employment project erm it needs to start in april they ll be paid the whole trunc gr trunc the whole year in advance in november pause dur short probably unclear space pause dur short so they could hold it for them till november till they get their money and i m so i told him you know what that s not true pause dur short he said no no she said it to me i said no er you ll find i think that that s not true oh no no no she s no she s very convinced but pause dur short i m sorry but i ll go for what
1	it s the second statement of the year pause dur short and the fact the best thing you can do is unclear and they turn up with the money and they ve got all the right references from their bank then we ll consider them
1	mm
1	but to start considering them
1	mm
1	goes by the board when you get a hundred pressure situations
1	yeah
1	it s easy to panic and go with something the other thing i find the churches do is they ve got a very enthusiastic pause dur short champion pause dur short of the project pause dur short often the picker pause dur short who pause dur short has seen other things succeed
1	mm
1	and is sure he can do it as well
1	mm
1	i use he pause dur short on purpose pause dur short he can do it as well pause dur short erm actually he has no training and no skills to do that kind of consideration that we were looking at
1	right
1	but he leads them pause dur short into pause dur short chaos
1	mm
1	or actually i know one moment he s done it too pause dur short erm pause dur short adapted the whole church or project that by the time the church opens didn t exist but nor were there any replacements
1	no
1	like we had a list of people that we pause dur short bettered properly before we allowed a commitment pause dur short erm pause dur short it was a special needs group that a large proportion of the space pause dur short i would say about twenty percent of the building space was adapted for their special needs
1	mm
1	and by the time the building had been done pause dur short they had gone to the wind pause dur short and so they got a special needs work area
1	i know about that
1	erm that there was no tenant for because
1	yeah
1	there s no one else that s kind
1	yeah
1	it s a bit like at the anon type place we nearly got we had someone trying to convince us to install pause dur short child size toilets so they could run a nursery in the crypt
1	oh no
1	do you remember
1	yeah
1	and we went into the business plan to trunc star trunc er actually they got them from somewhere they got some they wanted to have fitted when we fitted the place up pause dur short and we actually did the standard procedure at that time come back to us with your business plan pause dur short and show us how you re gonna pay us this money they disappeared
1	mm
1	so asking people to come with their business plan and their references from their bank pause dur short a letter saying they have the
1	mm
1	was important
1	i think what we ve done this time as well pause dur short was pause dur short we looked at the status of their unclear vacated and thought these are derelict and nobody s gonna want them pause dur short but how on earth can we do the math so we went in very defensively said oh pause dur short did pretty crap but pause dur short you know whatever and then we discovered that actually most businesses pause dur short fully recognise when they come in for a property
1	mm
1	they will do it up they will design it for themselves but they re erm
1	mm
1	unclear
1	mm
1	so actually they they can come in you know some unclear come in pause dur short and it will look like the worst pile of pause dur short of of
1	of trash yeah
1	of trash you ve ever seen in your whole life
1	but they never use that bar anyway
1	and then they would never yeah
1	never
1	they gonna strip out unclear the whole place out get unclear to get it back to the pause dur short to the trunc ba trunc
1	but do you remember we we install the bar in the crypt pause dur short it cost us a thousand pounds a metre
1	oh yes of course yes of course
1	and as soon as we got tenants pause dur short they took it out
1	yeah
1	it then ended up in the other end of the crypt for a while and then it moved upstairs for a while and it was trash
1	yeah
1	and it cost that much cos the walls didn t fit it
1	yeah
1	it had to go down the bar
1	yeah
1	but there was no need for us to do that
1	no
1	cos once we got the restaurant in they wanted to design their own kitchen and unclear
1	yeah
1	and everything else
1	yeah
1	erm so no fitting out is not what you need to do
1	no
1	cos they ll put their own colour paint on the wall
1	yeah and even the school unclear pause dur short came in and unclear came in with that kind of paint
1	mm
1	and painted this and once they painted it white it looked utterly different pause dur short completely transformed
1	mm
1	that s all it all it needed was to remove the wall back unclear pause dur short erm the the control room needed a bit more work because there was i mean half of the unclear we really don t know given what we found in there afterwards but vocal desc laugh all the unclear electric etcetera they ve been going on there
1	yeah
1	but erm so that you know that had to be sort of seriously stripped out but erm stripping out is the least of it really
1	yeah yeah
1	and in erm pause dur short this pause dur short erm trunc th trunc they re not supposed that the lot in unclear can can actually thought about how it s gonna be paid for day to day and who s gonna
1	and part of it
1	carry on paying the rent
1	because she trunc s trunc knows unclear of that is trying to produce bigger things pause dur short but they re not based on pause dur short i don t know where he s getting his projected costs from in terms of utilities
1	no
1	and things like that
1	mm
1	or pause dur short erm i think what he does is calculate the costs and then say i need this much income
1	right
1	but that
1	he s very interested in our
1	he s
1	figures
1	good what he he understands and certainly
1	yeah
1	unclear know that
1	yeah
1	so i do think that you look back and you realise from the beginning pause dur short i did the model for it actually which is really funny cos i wasn t into figures that much i was doing my masters in management at the time so i began to understand it a little bit pause dur short erm the very first cash flow projections we produced first of all on an annual basis in our budget in our business plan pause dur short but as soon as we got nearer to running we did it on a monthly basis
1	yeah
1	and we could tell when the bigger bills were gonna come in in the whole lot
1	yeah
1	so we always knew where we were pause dur short the one thing that
1	we filled in our books on that basis to this day actually
1	and it s it would
1	what your annual accounts look is er is one thing but if you ve got three months in the middle you have no money and you have loads of creditors then you re gonna go down
1	yeah you are you are pause dur short and so i try i ve told people that at endless training events
1	mm
1	some of them you will always find someone in the attending who s worked in business enough to know why you re saying it
1	mm
1	but a lot of people trunc n trunc don t have a clue why i ve said it
1	no
1	it s a a wing and a prayer for them pause dur short erm
1	and to this day we don t have an overdraft
1	right good you don t need one
1	no i know but you know
1	it s a pain if you have one cos then it starts yeah
1	yeah well that s just er yeah that s because they er
1	erm pause dur short so i think i think all of that was that cash flow projection i remember all the board meetings i was in where that was er that was what controlled everything we did
1	yeah
1	and it should
1	yeah pause dur short it does now makes my unclear
1	the one thing i think we didn t do we probably never got in front enough pause dur short but some places can anon type place i did their business plan oh and they re trunc f trunc they were following it two years later and they were doing incredibly well
1	that s good that is good
1	erm what you need is to put into the bank enough money to hold you over when there are voids
1	yeah
1	because in a building that s pause dur short total pause dur short you i mean you heat the whole thing or none of it
1	mm
1	that s what i mean by it s er it s a single unit in one sense although it s broken up
1	yeah
1	you re still gonna have to pay the heating bill whether the people are in or not
1	yeah
1	er whether the big space is filled or not
1	no
1	all the little people still need their heat
1	yeah
1	so you still need to have money in the bank to cover the average length of the void
1	yeah
1	which could be six months or something
1	oh it can easily be six months by the time you unclear
1	unclear yeah
1	unclear that s the finished messing about unclear
1	mm
1	i mean and we erm we did the maths recently and worked out that pause dur short if we weren t there and only the congregation were there pause dur short it would still cost thirty six thousand pounds a year to run the building
1	mm pause dur short just to keep it open
1	yeah and that s without anybody actually being in any other part of the building apart from the church space
1	mm
1	because you would still need to insure the whole thing
1	mm
1	and although erm pause dur short our friend from anon type place pause dur short thinks that perhaps the insurance on a church as part of the building might be pause dur short cheaper than the insurance on the rest of it so why can t they have a discount pause dur short on their
1	the fact is it s er
1	contribution towards the insurance though it s not true actually the whole building you know the whole building is insured as a whole
1	mm
1	not er space by space by space likewise electricity bill likewise pause dur short erm lightning rod maintenance pause dur short gas certificate electric certificates water certificate blah blah blah blah
1	mm
1	then you add up pause dur short a thousand here two thousand there
1	yeah
1	five thousand here twenty thousand for insurance whatever
1	yeah oh absolutely
1	get up to thirty six without blinking
1	completely
1	and so when erm pause dur short people like anon nametype m type name think do you know what we ll take it back and we ll run it ourselves pause dur short they don t reckon on the fact that to stand still they have to raise thirty six thousand
1	yeah
1	to stand still
1	mm pause dur short absolutely and i do think that was that in a sense summarises what we got right we did pause dur short do all that work on running the building
1	mm
1	before we got into detail on designing the building
1	yeah
1	we made it manageable first
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short and tested out the management plan quite well which is managing and business plan pause dur short in one pause dur short before we then started saying okay how would we now adapt the building cos we had to alter all kinds of
1	mm
1	stuff on the different levels how the trunc stairca trunc unclear access it and the church space that they wanted to keep
1	yeah
1	which was actually a foyer
1	yeah
1	had to be cut off from the staircase
1	yeah
1	otherwise they were simply a throughway
1	yeah
1	but each space had to be individually pause dur short manageable because we needed to make it viable financially we trunc nee trunc did need to do one off lets of an evening or a weekend we needed to do trunc m trunc the majority of the building in permanent rent
1	yeah
1	and so getting all that manageability right then we could say to the architect we need to redo the building to trunc s trunc to do this managing structure
1	mm
1	to make this work pause dur short erm pause dur short and he he did
1	yeah
1	erm but that s the right way round
1	yeah
1	and he and er the architect and the quantity surveyor gave us pause dur short a sum of what they thought pause dur short they could do that for all modestly that would make the building manageable
1	yeah
1	and we didn t get any detailed design done until we got the work we got the money done
1	yeah
1	so we figured well okay that s the minimum we will now go and look for where we could find that kind of money
1	yeah
1	erm and there was potential for that
1	and then pause dur short but i guess how many what percentage of people would you say start with an architect
1	ninety eight percent
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i haven t had any response
1	yeah
1	from anon nametype m type name pause dur short at anon type place since i sent him an e mail saying i was working on the hlf form pause dur short by the way was the architect appointed by competitive tender because the hlf would require that
1	mm
1	he s never answered because i think the way the diocese operates is pause dur short an old boy type structure
1	i wouldn t be surprised
1	somebody in the diocese told him this would be a good architect this would be a good trunc pronage trunc project manager
1	yeah
1	and he s never they ve never looked at other people
1	no
1	and i think that pause dur short he s probably sitting there unclear cos the kind of questions i ve asked him pause dur short are pause dur short ones he s never unclear clever guy
1	yeah
1	who knows a huge amount about quite a lot
1	yeah
1	but he s in his comfort zone actually even though he trunc de trunc determined the project will happen but er pause dur short there s no one he s dealing with so pause dur short he s given me no more contacts where s that where s that unclear grant thing pause dur short he had to go to the local authority for pause dur short community right to bill
1	oh yes
1	it became clear i filled in a form and sent it through to him that he needed to find out what the local authority was doing with the community right to bill cos they had to endorse
1	mm
1	his bid
1	mm
1	and he can t act as someone in the council and basically they said to him oh no no no for goodness sake don t get us involved in that it s a nightmare
1	mm
1	so he unclear me that response but pause dur short what s he doing with it
1	yeah
1	that has to be taken up locally and the council does need to be involved with it
1	yeah absolutely
1	but erm pause dur short they re very much on the route of starting with the architect
1	yeah
1	like a nice community centre here pause dur short and i m absolutely all
1	they ve trunc do trunc done a fantastic drawing
1	all
1	unclear useful unclear drawing
1	all round the houses they pay a huge amount of money to be architects over pause dur short then he was like
1	but when
1	you know he was like but we must be able to get money from the big lottery they do community fund raising i said yes they do
1	no
1	but us pause dur short they will only pay up to sixty percent vocal desc cough of the due bill community hall next month the cost of the building is half a million
1	yeah
1	so he said well we we could work within that and that could be part of our sunday i said the big lottery doesn t work like that it has to be it
1	no yeah
1	it has to be the biggest funder so that they can control how you do it
1	yeah
1	they they don t play ball with what you want they ll never be a part or minor funder pause dur short and in any case if they are just about one of the biggest where are you gonna get the other pause dur short two and a half millions from pause dur short in order to take up theirs pause dur short so he said
1	well that s another four four funders isn t it er er
1	yeah and they re there but then
1	how could they trunc ab trunc nah
1	erm pause dur long erm i have given him the right things which he should revisit their aim and that stuff but i think he s in that thing that you were talking about he gets so down so far down the path that he spends so much money on it
1	yeah
1	that you can t back track and say let s start the design again
1	no
1	he theoretically has said to me pause dur short well if we can t raise the money pause dur short why don t we look at the design and go for something more modest we could go for a single storey for that pause dur short and i m fine i think he might be need to do that and if he doesn t hear back cos
1	no
1	he might not pause dur short trunc th trunc pause dur short i think the the business part i think it s unclear has potential
1	yeah
1	and one unclear nearer and nearer pause dur short but he won t do it without he won t get the gas works section done in six without pause dur short the council feeling they re achieving it
1	yeah
1	so it s it s it s working with the council pause dur short working with business leaders so that they do a trunc l trunc it s exactly like anon type place exactly
1	yeah
1	exactly like anon type place but far more money
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short but is that relationship which
1	but actually what s dangerous what s worrying about it is the building is so much smaller i doubt that you can have more than one thing happening in there at a time one or two things happening in there at at a time and that means that those things have got to
1	well that means essentially unclear caf
1	yeah
1	on the plan pause dur short but they don t know what kind of caf
1	no
1	erm pause dur short like i said all it what would excel pause dur short er what kind of food is it like the restaurant or will you just be taking their pause dur short customers from it
1	in which case immediate drop unclear from your local business community
1	yeah or and he said well it might be healthy eating and i said is there a market inside doors that has a trunc health trunc healthy eating caf pause dur short and he doesn t know
1	no
1	no that s not where we were with the anon type place we had tested all those things out and i think pause dur short to go fundraising for them you actually have to ask pause dur short for those things to be tested out
1	yeah
1	and then the design will only valid in the context that but he s already started asking that pause dur short architect to take the design forward pause dur short to the next stage
1	mm
1	which is pause dur short i m thinking still that he should still be in the unclear pause dur short let s think about whether this
1	yeah
1	is the community audit which is entirely missing from there which is
1	yeah
1	that giving the right business unclear
1	yeah
1	to the business plan
1	what happened unclear if you build it they will come pause dur short it s pause dur short so they
1	it won t
1	cos unclear boat
1	mm
1	it could be peaceful and and you know on the day they re opening people will flock towards it and they d take it to their hearts pause dur short and immediately become utterly well used by everybody who d be queuing up to unclear
1	just occasionally that happened
1	yeah
1	but only by luck chance you found the right local budget but i m not convinced they found the right local budget you know
1	no pause dur long
1	a lot of the projects they want in there pause dur short are probably entirely the right ones
1	yeah
1	but they need to go and see the projects that s why i said to them well how are you gonna run these things how are we gonna know we ll have organisation unclear come in and pay for the space
1	that s sensible
1	well who are they
1	yeah
1	where s their letter saying they want this space
1	yeah
1	and telling you how many people they re gonna have and where and how
1	yeah and how much they re gonna pay or how much they can afford to pay you actually that
1	yeah or if unclear one pause dur short council unclear cos that s a great local need pause dur short erm do you need the seven that are on your plan tell me how you re gonna schedule the time unclear pause dur short er is the demand and trunc th trunc all the time or do you actually need pause dur short three rooms pause dur short because over a day they ll all get used up whereas seven
1	yeah
1	will only be used at peak times do you just need to move your unclear appointments unclear
1	yeah
1	and again it s the kind of things which anon nametype m type name looks at things like you know he goes glazed
1	yeah
1	cos he doesn t know how to think of it and that kind of develops the details
1	yeah
1	but you have to
1	i know you have to i mean trunc th trunc trunc th trunc
1	unclear
1	yeah
1	gave me years ago that i still use pause dur short which was pause dur short when you look at design and space you gonna start briefing an architect if you know you got a group coming in that s going to use your hall once a week or
1	mm
1	three times a week pause dur short what is the average attendance
1	mm
1	and what is the maximum attendance
1	mm
1	unclear like unclear occasional
1	yeah
1	well pause dur short when i was a vicar i had a hall below the church that was used by a pensioner project probably twice or three times a year pause dur short they had three hundred people in
1	mm
1	they were allowed only because they had so many doors to be outside there wasn t really much internal space really three hundred pause dur short but pause dur short it s no good designing the space for those three hundred when actually most days they only had twenty five
1	yeah
1	you need to do space to be able to work mostly for twenty five with
1	yeah
1	the occasional squash
1	yeah
1	so churches then say oh we have four hundred people sometimes pause dur short well actually it s once a year
1	yeah cos yeah
1	and alright unclear remembrance day
1	oh
1	cos you unclear
1	oh right
1	so all the army service is oriented so everyone turns up pause dur short so you don t design anything to service four hundred people or
1	no
1	unclear when the four hundred people are there you design for what you normally have
1	mm
1	and you know the churches on that same basis would say to me we ve got to have a kitchen we ve got to be able to cook here
1	oh
1	and then it turns out when you er that eighty thousand pounds was supposed to have servery for about fifteen thousand
1	yeah
1	servery being a sink and dishwasher cutlery and that kind of stuff
1	yeah
1	unclear erm
1	and a fridge
1	and a fridge yeah fridge dishwasher sink pause dur short erm and then you say to them well when are you actually going to cook and it turns out it unclear
1	mm
1	well do you want to pay eighty five thousand pounds for a kitchen that gets used once a year or do you order fish and chips service
1	yeah
1	or do you do something well we don t like carrying food in well eighty five thousand is a lot of money
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	you could buy caterers a lot of times over
1	yeah
1	with that money
1	unclear for that
1	yeah exactly so i tend to
1	well yeah sorry yeah
1	push hard to get the money use
1	yeah
1	to construct a servery but once they ve got it trunc i trunc it s always enough
1	yeah
1	erm there is one church i ve been working with that erm pause dur short had determined they had to have a kitchen pause dur short because they want to have a project for the homeless
1	yup
1	er serving lunch every day
1	mm
1	every weekday
1	mm
1	er at you know community rate and so i know they unclear pressed the numbers they have a legacy so they ve got lots of money which is a dreadful shame pause dur short and a couple of them were really really really pushing that they had to have a kitchen to do the cooking in so i said i it s not my decision whether you have a kitchen or not but it seemed to be an enormous amount of money to spend that you ought to justify to yourself
1	mm
1	oh but it s our mission pause dur short so i said that s fine pause dur short i think you need to do several things one of them is go to all the homeless projects in the town pause dur short and check out with each of them if there is a pause dur short gap between demand and
1	yeah
1	supply
1	yeah
1	in other words er do you really need another homeless project i know you d like it and you want to be doing something
1	yeah
1	for people who are really poor but are there any really poor who are gonna turn up
1	yeah
1	are you going to install this kitchen and finally you get one or two people once a week pause dur short and they they wouldn t do it they wouldn t do it pause dur short they did never did the homework erm two of the people on the group very much wanted to the vicar wouldn t back them even though he knew what d been said was totally sensible cos his wife was one of the others who were we ve got to have a mission to the homeless people
1	ah
1	and along with another person who i can t pause dur short unclear a bit mad pause dur short erm
1	you haven t said enough to me who know trunc w trunc who these people they could be anywhere in england
1	they could be anywhere in england that s
1	or even out of england
1	they could be out of england couldn t they pause dur short erm but anyway because they got their own money they went on and had a kitchen both
1	mm
1	being built at the moment pause dur short and it was it s a bit of foolishness because they ve only got about twenty five or thirty people in the church pause dur short they ve got a number of pensioners who use are using it all voluntarily and it it just to keep the church going
1	yeah
1	who are not interested in turning up to trunc ba trunc make lunches every day
1	no
1	and they ve not talked about how they re gonna get the money for the food and the ingredients and who s gonna be the manager and do the shopping and all that it s all pie in the sky
1	mm
1	and they expect pause dur short eighty thousand more than they need to to
1	yeah
1	have a servery
1	yeah
1	so
1	and actually they re unclear
1	well that s
1	because actually doing that with volunteers
1	you can t do it
1	you can t do it
1	in charge of the safety of the volunteers you need an expert in
1	yeah
1	controlling homeless people
1	yeah
1	so again it s a kind of thing that pause dur short where is your market
1	yeah
1	how are you gonna serve your market how is it manageable
1	yeah
1	is it really there and i don t think there was one for them i never saw
1	no
1	a single trunc ho trunc single homeless person malingering around the church where i was going quite a lot of unclear period of time
1	yeah
1	well that was an issue pause dur short i think you would ve seen quite a lot
1	yeah
1	i m sure if you are there all the time you see some
1	but then you ve got to be careful as well because i mean round you know it s unclear around that building you know there was a guy lying unclear on the grass in the church yard having had a whole thing full of pause dur short unclear probably and was as they went up tenants and asked him if he was alright to see if he was dead or alive turned up he was alive but he claimed the case and stuff like that erm what and you get a lot of in the church yard but you ve got you ve also then you ve got to have something you unclear to say couldn t do unclear there s no point in you opening the doors in your inner unclear and letting six heroin addicts walk in and sit down i mean pause dur short people unclear complain to people you know there s been a chair of trustees plus the manager who couldn t tell because pause dur short they had homeless people on their premises and they didn t stop them taking drugs
1	mm
1	and they weren t allowing them to take drugs and they weren t encouraging them to take drugs but they weren t actually unclear
1	they turned a blind eye
1	them to take some drugs and they both went to jail and i say and people go ho ho ho unclear exaggeration you think er no trunc e trunc you you know this is a unclear every time er anon nametype m type name lets somebody in to use the toilet or to have a cup of tea they still unclear
1	mm
1	fortunately the unclear pause dur short unclear pause dur short you know theft caused by someone being an idiot pause dur short unclear so he actually got his money back trunc th trunc the unclear pause dur short cos he sort of ran unclear and left something in the toilet and didn t come back and check for a while erm you know and fortunately unclear but other unclear pocket
1	yeah
1	but you know but er you know unclear they do let people in premises to get a cup of tea or whatever but you can t have somebody there you and you cannot leave a bunch of volunteers to supervise people who ve got fundamental issues like heroin addiction and they re on the street
1	yeah
1	or they re taking drugs out in the open and then falling coma unclear pause dur short you know where they
1	and being unclear your steps
1	yeah
1	with their hepatitis and their aids and all the other things they re carrying in their blood and
1	yeah
1	then the old ladies come to church and don t understand why it matters
1	yeah
1	yeah it s it s all of that stuff that people need to understand
1	and also how they re going to pay for example i mean this is a thing that what we have to we have to talk over and over again haven t we pause dur short you ve got to have unclear or you can you ve got to have some clients or some tenants who ve got the money to pay something because you can t accept er quid pro quo you can t accept everybody s paying unclear even people that you suspected and thought to pay more unclear and try and drive down to ludicrous levels
1	what do you think about pause dur short a group that has twenty five adults in it
1	mm
1	those people are probably spending five pounds a day on alcohol and five pounds a day on cigarettes
1	mm
1	and let alone the drugs pause dur short that are around various kinds pause dur short so those people if they went to their pubs for their evening out would spend the minimum pause dur short ten or fifteen pounds
1	mm
1	so when they come to do an activity in your building pause dur short they can afford to spend ten or fifteen pounds on the activity
1	yeah
1	per person
1	yeah
1	and so multiple that by your twenty five people pause dur short and you ve got quite a lot of money
1	yeah
1	and they still have a mindset of you ve got to do things really cheap or give them away if you re a church
1	yeah yeah
1	and that s not true
1	no
1	you ve got to be able to make the hard decisions
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short some people some churches i work with will understand that
1	yeah well if i could if i had quick unclear turned up to me and said pause dur short erm how can you unclear pause dur short or pause dur short i thought you were supposed to be a charity
1	mm
1	and then i had this man who came and see me who who argued that i couldn t really be a charity because we were all all earning our own money pause dur short and charities don t earn money which must mean that we re project we must be a private company we can t be a charity because we re earning our own money that s to say erm pause dur short but then you ve got to set a
1	no
1	church unclear er no i don t think so oh yes yes yes yes if you re earning money you ve got to set a church unclear
1	you re not trading if you re letting space
1	no and then and then other people come to me and say well you know pause dur short of course it s not a charity how can you be a charity unclear charitable to you actually
1	do you remember who was setting up the structure for anon type place pause dur short i was absolutely determined i don t know how many of this is true i just think it s common sense i ve been around the church but we pause dur short we needed to have a group who were pause dur short guiding pause dur short officers pause dur short body
1	yeah
1	that would make the hard decisions like if someone s not paying the rent we throw them out
1	yeah
1	because all of those people depend on coming to some kind unclear pause dur short who can t bear to have a bad name in the community and so pause dur short if you were really christian you wouldn t let me off
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short what s christian about letting you off what you committed yourself to pay if you were a christian you d pay what you agreed
1	yeah
1	you d keep to your contract
1	mm
1	if you didn t like the rent when you started why didn t you talk to us about it then
1	mm
1	but we ve made a commitment to switch the heating on because you d said you d pay your rent erm and you ve used that heating pause dur short erm so where s trunc th trunc where s a christian issue from our point of view because we ll let you off
1	yeah
1	when you haven t kept your commitment you know all that stuff but you know that s why when we i said we must have a group running it structured so that they could make the hard decisions i said people with teeth
1	mm
1	they re crocodiles
1	yeah
1	people with teeth who could bite the bullet and say i m sorry no
1	yeah
1	and it didn t come back trunc th trunc the vicar was supposed to be the nice guy and tried to pause dur short be both sides at the same time
1	yeah
1	so you have to have a final decision made by someone who hasn t whose job wasn t about being unclear timely unclear
1	but that s really difficult i mean i still i get fed up of someone looking at me and thinking you know what you re a unclear
1	mm
1	and they re the ones who are on the board pause dur short and you re actually thinking unclear terribly where i pause dur short by the fact that somebody s not paying us
1	at least in the beginning pause dur short at least it s trunc o trunc it s one of the difficulties is pause dur short both members are unclear to change over the years pause dur short and their reasons for joining might be various
1	mm
1	but you need the right pause dur short mix
1	mm
1	and at the beginning we certainly do get enough people but we unclear to make sure they understood the business of what
1	yeah
1	we re trying to do
1	yeah
1	but if the business of what we re trying to do failed then the whole building failed and
1	yeah
1	the church would be gone as well
1	yeah
1	erm
1	well actually what was quite interesting there was somebody as well pause dur short it s we were trying to do various things and move on and do extra unclear and pause dur short erm the council for example wants to know about the board
1	aha
1	and wants to know how many of us are anon type place residents and how many of us are from different ethnic groups and our ages and our gender and stuff like that pause dur short erm they re and they are interested that unclear should should unclear bid unclear a particular demographic pause dur short profile or whatever especially living in anon type place without reference to the fact that can we run pause dur short can we run a business pause dur short within us you know all we re saying is that we want to run an asset pause dur short and they re not asking us about what our businesses groups are and who we ve got on the board they re interested in how erm in how many people i ve got or how many people i ve got who are disabled or whatever and they ve sort of been actually pause dur short it is difficult cos we ve never and unclear to kind of quantify our social value i mean we ve never had to do that before because pause dur short we ve never had a grant we ve never gone down that route we ve never been so useful so i mean unclear to say well you know we ve got to wash our face we ve got to know this we ve always got to earn more than we spend because otherwise the
1	unclear
1	yeah
1	mm pause dur short i do think that that er that er i ve tried to stay out of that game on
1	mm
1	and i tried to teach churches for example again we were doing it when we set up anon type place we would not have a board that was made up of representatives of the anon nametype n type name group
1	mm
1	because they ve done that before and it failed because each of the unclear
1	yeah
1	had the best in interest to not allowing
1	yeah
1	the rent to be realistic cos
1	yeah
1	they wanted to pay less
1	yeah
1	you ve got to have a board that does it on the basis of the umbrella
1	yeah
1	building
1	yeah
1	and to keep it viable
1	yeah
1	that s the sole basis for your field and that includes co opting people for their skills
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short in fact you could just play a funny game with numbers you only have pause dur short two numbers pause dur short at the collective pause dur short anon type place
1	mm
1	of the diocese of anon type place
1	mm
1	the rest of you are co opted members
1	mm
1	but you re co opted for your skills
1	mm
1	er which was fundamentally the structure we started with
1	yeah pause dur short oh anon nametype m type name said to me the other day pause dur short he said to us oh unclear
1	we re not office unclear we are
1	and i sort of said
1	unclear
1	oh no you can just carry on and unclear no oh pause dur short unclear so it s obviously vocal desc laugh there s obviously something behind the question
1	well he he
1	but yeah
1	structured the only one he knows is the broker church council structure
1	mm
1	which should be rubbish for running this kind of thing and
1	mm
1	i m trying to explain that to people that if you stay in the pause dur short under the pcc certain amount as a subcommittee of the pcc with its own terms of reference that allows you
1	yeah
1	not to be re elected every year that allows you to unclear with skills pause dur short and so on because it s the only way you could stay unclear you cannot have new trustees once a year and expect
1	mm
1	to trunc conti trunc continue to make good decisions about
1	mm
1	that have to be based pause dur short on being financially viable
1	yeah pause dur short it s been quite difficult with some of those people pause dur short the board anyway
1	i know
1	get unclear what do you think and they said oh no vocal desc laugh how could we come up with that solution oh it s him oh him again vocal desc laugh him again with his unclear decision making erm
1	but it it was pause dur short that was trunc e trunc exactly why we set up that complicated thing at the beginning that pause dur short erm pause dur short meant that there were two shares in the company
1	mm
1	unclear because we knew that the pcc pause dur short was unreliable
1	yeah
1	and in a sense we couldn t trust the dioceses pause dur short er pause dur short to not pull the programme down because they got fed up with the hassle
1	yeah
1	cos it was hassle
1	mm
1	anon type place was a major nightmare they would ve loved to have been out of it but they did because it was anon type place and the public image they would ve got to have
1	yeah
1	closed the major church in anon type place
1	yeah
1	etcetera so if you gave each of them a share neither of them could unclear the other they had to agree on the way forward and i thought that in the basis of our business planning pause dur short and having a pause dur short council of trustees who pause dur short were making the hard decisions pause dur short that the dioceses for the unclear future would back it
1	mm
1	cos at the moment the dioceses from that structured point of view is more reliable than the pause dur short parish
1	yeah
1	but there could come a point in the future when the diocese says we actually think we re gonna take this building over we ve got the right to unclear we re gonna turn it into the diocese s office
1	yeah
1	and er that would be a good idea pause dur short er the pcc could say no
1	well i mean if unclear that would be fine if they wanted to if they wanted to do that unless they you know unclear preserve the building
1	yeah for the people in anon type place
1	yeah and
1	actual interpretation and
1	yeah
1	they would be a good tenant but they can come from anon type place in fact they would never do it because the staff wouldn t go to work in anon type place
1	they might just change it pause dur short unclear pause dur short but and actually what is pause dur short er what is extraordinary is that the two businesses are two keeping businesses now pause dur short their client group pause dur short are really posh white young people
1	oh really
1	yeah pause dur short trunc rea trunc you know
1	anon type place anon type place unclear cos then had to do it for my when i did my masters pause dur short erm in turns of what makes this pause dur short a a successful redevelopment
1	mm
1	you know on the regeneration bit how what kind are there places you can t be generated
1	yeah
1	and that which ones are really susceptible to regeneration
1	yeah
1	where anon type place fitted the susceptible to regeneration because it had a mixture of pause dur short social grouping social classes unclear
1	mm
1	success in the past
1	mm
1	but ones that don t work are the things like the anon type place or anon type place
1	yeah
1	where they d never be pause dur short a a viable community
1	no
1	it s always been a unclear and you replaced it with small housing that would become hatches for people that had no money to get outside them
1	yeah
1	and all that stuff if you re gonna have a mix pause dur short a really mixed community of all kinds then erm
1	and probably a mixed unclear house in that case as well trunc th trunc they
1	yeah well and er er
1	unclear
1	but when they redeveloped anon type place pause dur short anon type place and anon type place erm they actually put in a mixture of housing
1	mm
1	and only a proportion of it was welfare and a a a lot of pause dur short stark homes to buy and plus some big big private unclear so that they would always have a mix there in the future
1	yeah yeah
1	and it it it was a chance trunc the trunc they had a chance to get something started which could last erm it will take a long time to establish but it you know
1	yeah
1	and anon type place s got it built into its fabric
1	yeah
1	and there were even when even in its bad days there trunc w trunc there was always the artist community and the theatre stuff and all those mad people who used to be pause dur short do you remember the business plan thing and some of those theatre groups who thought they could take over and
1	oh yeah erm somebody came somebody said to me the other day this bloke came out to where the anon type place is pause dur short and he said oh i used to run this pause dur short i said oh it who who was that who was that guy anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name pause dur short who was the one are we gonna do the one unclear in anon type place or whatever
1	oh no
1	and there was some bloke who had a a mad theatre proposal and he was there unclear i don t know he he was selling
1	there was a guy and there was a guy who used to come who got very keen on it to find out there were only three of them working together to make it viable he was convinced he can manage and do the marketing someone else would be the director of programme pause dur short he was really fat pause dur short and i met him about pause dur short six years ago pause dur short and he was torn and skinny
1	was he
1	i and there was no way i could ever recognise him he was
1	no
1	absolutely of another the planet but he got the right name and the right story so it had to be him
1	mm
1	but he came and said hello to me pause dur short but they didn t work because of their business plan
1	mm
1	erm they actually hadn t got the ability to put on enough production to give themselves enough
1	yeah
1	income and they were totally dependent on well if utility can have the space we can apply to the arts council
1	yes
1	and get a grant
1	oh yeah
1	well the arts council do one year grants they re not there s no long term unclear
1	no
1	in that
1	no
1	you had to find someone who was fundamentally viable the guy who ends up unclear was the guy who could make it commercially viable and then would ve set unclear to be the cream on the cake
1	yeah yeah
1	not the cake
1	no
1	er and that was something else there we we must ve seen ten theatres that
1	oh i know and actually there was one unclear
1	well that s
1	unclear
1	the worst most angry that we handled there cos they
1	yeah
1	we need to do your business plan well he didn t know what a business plan was
1	no
1	so like pause dur short uh it d be really good
1	yeah what happened recently with this young man and they really really talked tough that we wouldn t let them have the space pause dur short and i just said well pause dur short actually unclear to one line on your own business plan pause dur short which says we have no money
1	well
1	vocal desc laugh as if i d let you you set it yourself vocal desc laugh there it is you know you you gave that unclear to me
1	if we yeah and if we let you in you have to spare your deposit for when you move in
1	yeah
1	and you pay rent from day one
1	yeah and you
1	unclear
1	i have no money
1	you have no money so
1	yeah
1	we can t do it because
1	yeah
1	you can t put the heating on
1	yeah absolutely
1	you can t put the lights on and can you run a theatre with no lights and no heating
1	unclear these people
1	unclear too
1	mm
1	unclear
1	oh
1	colour
1	oh these are really really posh white people actually pause dur short and they were so different because you know they re very entitled
1	and you re very ordinary looking people how dare you tell posh people like them that they can t have what they want
1	yeah yeah they were trunc ve trunc they were very insistent but erm you know they d done their survey how many young people in anon type place wants the theatre and pause dur short etcetera etcetera so er
1	there was some visitor it reminded me of when i living in anon type place
1	aha
1	the old anon type place would give out tickets to certain kinds of events
1	oh yeah
1	so local people could go along
1	yeah
1	erm and there was a pause dur short an event coming along and i for some reason took out the ticket pause dur short who did i go with you might ve been my sister pause dur short there s a play called the house of albina
1	oh yes yes yes er yes erm house of something alba yes
1	yeah anyway this little theatre company supposedly was putting this on pause dur short and we got to the theatre where the people there were about ten people in the audience pause dur short and erm pause dur short it was absolutely tragic absolutely tragic i don t know how you can make what is otherwise a successful play into anything so dreadful
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and it got to the interval pause dur short and erm pause dur short we went to the bar pause dur short and got ourselves a drink pause dur short we were the only ones in the bar pause dur short and i said to the person i was with i really don t know if i can face going back in but pause dur short i i feel bad for unclear of any audience pause dur short and the guy behind the bar says well if the unclear last this long nobody else would
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and what it turned out was
1	oh my word
1	it was one of those typical anon type place type of thing cos i know unclear anon type place the girl in the play pause dur short albina alba or whatever her name was pause dur short her father she convinced him to pay
1	wow
1	for them to have to do their production in anon type place
1	oh right
1	no anon type place
1	oh
1	anon type place
1	oh
1	in anon type place cos anon type place wasn t going quite so strongly then and erm pause dur short had taken it on pause dur short and it never worked
1	no of course
1	cos
1	actually that was probably the one who came to tried to take the space the other year
1	probably was
1	and who runs a small phone company or trunc s trunc unclear company and trunc h trunc he was setting her up with her own acting school
1	it could ve been easy almost identical if it s not the space but how could a father do it twice i can t imagine
1	well he didn t in the end cos he wanted to rent he wanted the rent he wanted unclear period which he wasn t given pause dur short so
1	wow pause dur short absolutely trunc ba trunc
1	you know trunc i trunc it s a vanity project i mean you can pay for it and i don t know how many vanity projects might ve spent unclear
1	well absolutely
1	and then with the unclear once it s all over it s a huge disaster after it months you just all walk out of the building and the
1	and having paid no money
1	and having paid no money after eighteen your eighteen month experiment to our expense pause dur short so
1	i did find that there were on one community premises the church was pause dur short nearly manipulated into letting it happen pause dur short the group wanted to move in pause dur short and they were totally grant funded
1	mm
1	and they wanted erm a rent free period in return for having fitted the place out pause dur short and i said to the pause dur short church why would you let that happen oh they re so nice
1	mm
1	blah blah blah
1	and they set the place out
1	well absolutely and i said but it s not their money they haven t not a single penny of the organisation s money has been spent on anything like that that was entirely grant money it s entirely someone else s so it s not their money and they re now out of pocket pause dur short it s entirely separate
1	mm
1	cos their granny or somebody did it do you see what i mean pause dur short so there s absolutely no justification for a rent free period
1	vocal desc laugh
1	trunc i trunc trunc i trunc it s a silly sentimental
1	yeah
1	er unthinking
1	yeah
1	nonsense
1	yeah
1	absolute nonsense
1	but it s also been taken by people actually it s also believing
1	yeah
1	whatever unclear people want to give you when they turn up
1	oh absolutely
1	and taking absolutely a face value and
1	yeah
1	and thinking and actually it s taken me a long time to work out how people actually just lie to your face
1	well trunc i trunc yeah they will lie to your face pause dur short they will particularly tell you exactly what they think you need to hear in order to
1	yeah
1	push the button
1	yeah
1	and trunc th trunc that was erm pause dur short a certain ethnic group pause dur short were more liable to do that than others
1	mm
1	when in the groups
1	mm
1	erm simply because that s the culture in their where they came from
1	mm
1	who er i ve been mentioning their name
1	vocal desc laugh unclear turn up pause dur short we were very much enclosed to that kind of give a home to this unclear club and then trunc i trunc it well it came off and then pause dur short then unclear afterwards
1	yeah pause dur short everyone
1	but that was asking you know it was like yeah you know all the actresses are really good i know you need to see this and this and
1	they promote people cos they can t do the job to unclear department so you give people good references when you have unclear
1	yeah
1	so that you can get rid of them
1	yeah
1	it happens in pause dur short governments
1	mm
1	i mean in local governments and all that
1	mm
1	because it s very difficult to get rid of people on the grounds they re incompetent
1	yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short so what else would you say
1	okay so i think that s the first thing is to get your
1	yeah
1	your sustainability plan right
1	mm
1	your management your business planning your financial strategy and then all the things like
1	just to unclear
1	your letting rent and everything have to work to that
1	yeah
1	erm and then you have to test out your potential users
1	mm
1	if you re going to have anyone there all the time
1	mm
1	if it just regular lettings then you never let anyone come in until they ve paid their fee
1	yeah
1	or you take a big enough deposit from them that they only get back if they ve got all of that stuff you safeguard yourself when you do it
1	yeah
1	i think the second step is pause dur short i was just about to tell you because we were having this conversation about formulating what i thought by writing a comment at the church times
1	aha
1	saying there the second thing i think you do is to pause dur short mosey around research all the potential trunc s trunc sources of the kind of capital funding that you need in order to make this happen
1	right
1	including your own resources
1	aha
1	so i think once you determine what is actually needed and
1	yeah
1	how much of it and how you could do it in a way that is sustainable
1	yeah
1	so that s your market research really
1	yeah
1	or local audit in the charity unclear sect unclear but it is market research
1	yeah
1	your second step is to find out where you are going to what is a realistic amount of capital
1	yeah
1	that you could raise to pause dur short adapt your building
1	yeah
1	to change
1	yeah
1	and that means reading thoroughly through the lottery sources
1	yeah
1	again it is something that the anon nametype m type name people do need to do so that they understand why i m saying that it s unrealistic
1	yeah
1	er pause dur short i like them so much this this circle and i love i love being there but pause dur short i needed to be there more often
1	well yeah
1	but then
0	why not hide from the world
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	erm pause dur short three o clock pause dur short oh okay mine s half nine in the morning
0	yeah just before my pause dur short how long are you there for for your first pause dur short appointment pause dur short i m with this pause dur short anon nametype f type name person or pause dur short anon nametype f type name or anon nametype f type name or someone
0	she s not weird she s just
0	or like middle aged
0	no
0	i mean it might be a different person but i i don t really know unclear what they re called unclear
0	i think it is pause dur short it yeah pause dur short how long does each one last
0	okay
0	mm
0	okay pause dur short so i ll be able to go to my lecture at eleven then
0	yeah pause dur short yeah definitely yeah it won t vocal desc laugh it won t take that long
0	no i don t think it will
0	it s not gonna happen pause dur short no that s vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc sigh pause dur short yeah but you re not a lost cause
0	you re not you re not a lost cause
0	and you ve had a lot of time trunc f trunc like to yourself which is gonna make it kind of more difficult pause dur short to get back trunc int trunc like pause dur short vocal desc sigh like for you now like pause dur short the abnormal is normal
0	it s not stupid
0	yeah
0	and you have to keep trying pause dur short but vocal desc sigh pause dur short unclear then unclear like pause dur short the more you let it kind of pause dur short the thing is like pause dur short it it makes you think that it s you that doesn t wanna do anything
0	like i really don t any more pause dur short like the way my family were like like talking to me it sounded pause dur short as though it was my fault pause dur short and then i felt really awful about it and that s when i was like
0	i mean from the outside pause dur short people do think pause dur short well people can think it s your fault because pause dur short the symptoms of it are just like pause dur short you don t want to do things
0	you know there s a lot of money involved here and there are a lot of serious
0	important things involved here pause dur short like that would be affected if i decided to fuck things up which i have done pause dur short but whereas at home it was like if i pause dur short if i like acted out or something the only thing that would pause dur short affect would be like my family
0	mm
0	do they want you to do really well or do they just want you to do stuff all the time
0	they want me to do well up here cos they think i can
0	they think i have it in me and i really don t pause dur short it s not unclear there unclear
0	and maybe when you actually start getting like proper regular help pause dur short and let it kick in a bit
0	mm
0	why
0	oh my god
0	oh god
0	and it s like why would you put it at the end of the week you know it s just fucking stupid pause dur short i get one appointment every week pause dur short and it s on friday pause dur short and it s with a woman who wants me to
0	to leave
0	it s not what i want
0	yeah pause dur short it feels really out of my hands
0	like pause dur short those pause dur short trunc u trunc yeah
0	i feel like i ve messed it up way too much i really have done a really good job of fucking stuff up for myself so far
0	i think it can
0	i vocal desc sigh
0	yeah
0	mm
0	to be unclear and to adjust
0	like obviously you ve gotta get the forty percent pass mark but i think it allows you a bit of leeway to like pause dur short and i know it s not just missing assignments and missing someone else s problem it s actually when like pause dur short sitting down doing the work and
0	yeah
0	and i have this intense fear of just pause dur short doing it wrong and vocal desc sigh pause dur short and getting feedback and pause dur short then reading my work and
0	have has it always felt like that
0	i ve never actually read one pause dur short all the way through pause dur short i just hope that i ve spelt everything right i do spell check i don t pause dur short read through it because i can t
0	mm
0	i physically like i pause dur short my body seizes up pause dur short like i get pause dur short i get like really pause dur short tense
0	and i can t look at it pause dur short and then like when i get feedback i just pause dur short i just get like a cold sweat and i can t look at it and it s just not good pause dur short cos pause dur short you know you need feedback and pause dur short vocal desc sigh i just don t wanna do it wrong vocal desc sigh
0	mm cos it it trunc def trunc it definitely does sound like that like
0	the good thing is though like
0	i know i ve been saying this all along but pause dur short being first year at uni it s no necessarily about pause dur short excelling academically
0	yeah
0	it s pause dur short getting your life together pause dur short and getting pause dur short starting a new life basically and having you know pause dur short having such like kind of trunc l trunc learning a new way of living pause dur short which pause dur short is the biggest thing pause dur short the most important thing about first year like focus on your studies like pause dur short if you wanna pause dur short aim for pause dur short a really high grade in your second and third year just work really hard but pause dur short trunc fir trunc first year is about just getting used to the experience and getting to know people and pause dur short joining stuff and just pause dur short i mean that s supposedly why it s like not everyone has a load of fun trunc n trunc at uni in first year pause dur short but that s probably why they say like you ll have the time of your life because it s just
0	so pause dur short i m sure that s like added stress as well because it feels like you re in all the time
0	it feels like contact hours to me cos you have to go with your group
0	i mean it trunc soun trunc it sounds like that might be a big part of it
0	i don t know i don t i think so
0	or at the moment because pause dur short it s very strange that
0	i mean pause dur short in terms of choosing a degree pause dur short like i totally see where you re coming from now because pause dur short obviously it doesn t have to be the most like pause dur short if you if you don t really feel that inspired trunc the trunc pause dur short by anything you still have to i think to an extent be able to want to face it pause dur short you know and
0	no
0	yeah that i would be able to pause dur short kind of tap into what i liked about it at a level and be like oh yeah this is interesting and i can do this like
0	does your mind unclear like unclear
0	yeah
0	because pause dur short often pause dur short if you get the right medication pause dur short which pause dur short my problem was the fogginess pause dur short it can clear it can help like it can make your brain like untangle a bit like
0	i m so glad you get the fog thing cos i
0	yeah oh my god
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i get that as well
0	vocal desc laugh pause dur short and it s really hard when you wanna try and do work or write essays because you can t really look pause dur short outside of your trunc h trunc head
0	okay
0	vocal desc sigh
0	and it s because they care and they want you to have the best time and they want the best view pause dur short
0	yeah pause dur short cos you just pause dur short i dunno you just don t feel like you have the energy do you it s not
0	yeah
0	very like my reactions are very kinda like pause dur short mm pause dur short like
0	yeah like sometimes when i might do just pause dur short sabotage stuff to myself i just watch myself doing it like coming from outside of
0	mm
0	no
0	i know pause dur short i know
0	mm
0	yeah pause dur short i mean that s true as well like vocal desc laugh pause dur short i m constantly in my head but also don t pause dur short care a trunc sh trunc like i don t give a shit about myself like
0	mm
0	mm
0	and it s weird cos most of the time i was like well not most of the time but some of the time i m completely normal and
0	think pause dur short doesn t it
0	and i felt able to do thing trunc u trunc trunc u trunc more and i was actually surprised at how quickly it was
0	yeah
0	unclear i think that is unclear pause dur short it s a good way of looking at it
0	it is because there s i think there s a danger of like making yourself do too much
0	which and i think independence when you re depressed can be the most damaging thing you know pause dur short like obviously there are people like emailing you and shit but it s not direct nobody s coming and hammering on your door and saying anon nametype f type name get out of bed you know vocal desc laugh
0	oh wow
0	come all the where to anon type place
0	they are pause dur short they really are
0	i always get really scared like pause dur short if i ve missed something or pause dur short like well
0	it turns out they sent an email round yesterday saying that oh it is actually on i don t know why it s not on the pause dur short not on your timetable
0	oh well you shouldn t ve known well
0	vocal desc laugh i expect so pause dur short that s usually what they pause dur short work with like that s what they pause dur short measure it pause dur short by
0	what were you gonna use the grand for like accommodation or food for this year just for this year
0	anon type place
0	i ve got an overdraft
0	but pause dur short no
0	mm
0	yeah
0	that s really i thought they did
0	so pause dur short i m gonna get an unclear i unclear
0	yeah coop unclear yeah unclear pause dur short do you not get interest pause dur short erm overdraft
0	i ve not got a student bank account i ve just got a normal one
0	yeah
0	so i have cos my parents were like don t get a student account
0	well it s for this year and then it gets it pause dur short erm they give you more next year you get two grand next year
0	so i can have one grand overdraft this year
0	on my current account and
0	most accounts do that pause dur short even unclear
0	oh okay
0	perhaps they get fourteen grand imagine
0	okay
0	unclear okay unclear
0	have trouble with like paying unclear rent or unclear unclear
0	i can t believe you don t have an overdraft
0	no cos my parents are like don t even bother with overdrafts and student accounts but i was like okay pause dur short but i like
0	yeah i didn t think about it you could use that yeah definitely
0	mm
0	no it s definitely a good idea and then you just pay it back over summer pause dur short when you get a job
0	wow pause dur short but what if you didn t pay it back over summer
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i mean it s yeah it s fair enough like it s if you don t pay it back you just don t pause dur short yeah pause dur short they don t like come after you like
0	if it s one thousand four hundred pause dur short then that s not not too bad
0	yeah
0	screw you know what screw your parents
0	oh yeah
0	mm pause dur short that s cool
0	then i don t end up spending over
0	erm pause dur short yeah what does it say in here pause dur short when you open a student account with this unclear firm unclear pause dur short unclear get one now unclear pause dur short an interest free overdraft here we go pause dur short you can apply for up to five hundred in term one and up to trunc thu trunc two thousand after that
0	yeah pause dur short oh so you only get a pause dur short you only get five hundred in the first year then that s weird
0	it pause dur short your trunc f trunc in your first term you have to pay your loan back pause dur short and you re sometimes in overdraft but it s not pause dur short as much usually the first instalment isn t as much
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	three months pause dur short yeah
0	change it back vocal desc laugh
0	okay
0	like your allowance and then the rest of it s all just in another account and you don t have to worry about it pause dur short it just gets paid by like
0	student finance and whatever
0	that s cool
0	i mean anon type place s good pause dur short i ve never had any problems with it
0	to just change it yeah
0	cos then i don t have to worry about unclear everything if my appeal unclear doesn t come through i won t have to worry about it
0	until you could like pay it back yeah
0	but yeah pause dur short it is pause dur short it is a lot more than i thought it would be to be honest
0	i was wanting to go shopping today i was gonna get potatoes and mash and make like
0	toad in the hole but i didn t go shopping in the end pause dur short vocal desc laugh pause dur short suppose i could do it s not too late
0	what
0	to print
0	mm
0	go back home
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short yeah i am pause dur short i trunc do trunc i dunno i think i will be when it gets closer like if i m actually here till christmas i ll be excited but at the minute it just feels like
0	mm
0	what at the trunc mo trunc like now
0	but then i ve gotta hand in essays and stuff so it s like
0	mm
0	mm pause dur long yeah i dunno if it would actually help going to my dad s though to be honest but pause dur short unclear
0	do you feel like pause dur short you re still waiting until you want to feel like doing it pause dur short almost like obviously you don t wanna do it now pause dur short and you feel like you can t do it now pause dur short but do you feel like pause dur short i trunc w trunc do you feel like there s a sense of like pause dur short oh pause dur short i at some point pause dur short i can t pause dur short simply can t just feel like this for my whole life like i there will be a point where i surely unclear am or unclear suddenly like feel a bit pause dur short different to this pause dur short that it feels like it s not coming kinda thing
0	no i don t think so but i mean i am aware that i need to make change myself
0	i ve just kinda missed the appointment like vocal desc laugh really unfortunate i haven t done that but pause dur short i ve got like pause dur short an appointment with the academic advisor next week
0	mm
0	yeah i don t know i m just talking in terms of like pause dur short i don t know like present tense at the moment but erm pause dur short yeah i trunc d trunc vocal desc sigh i dunno like i just wanna try and write this i just don t pause dur short know where to start and every time i try i just pause dur short lose concentration like within five minutes
0	yeah pause dur short and it s so it s so frustrating to me because it s not even the important essay
0	it s just like a little pause dur short you know pause dur short unimportant thing that i have to do and i just can t get it done pause dur short because i m so pause dur short worked up about it and because it it feels like an insult if i were to just do it really quickly as well because like pause dur short this is what made me leave last year pause dur short this whole thing of not being able to do these essays is what pause dur short pretty much made me leave pause dur short and it just seems stupid to just be able to pause dur short bash one out and pause dur short that s it pause dur short and like the whole of last year meant absolutely nothing cos i just did it pause dur short in five minutes and i know that trunc g trunc not gonna happen because pause dur short i don t feel like that i can t pause dur short do it unclear but everyone unclear thinks i can pause dur short it s not
0	vocal desc laugh unclear thanks it s unclear
0	yeah pause dur short me too
0	like your head is kinda like on my unclear words unclear which pause dur short strange pause dur short but unclear i mean unclear
0	that it isn t yeah exactly it s not just like
0	you know it s not it s not in my head
0	anon nametype f type name being anon nametype f type name no way
0	cos it s so trunc coinc trunc it would be too coincidental for us both to feel exactly the same about this sort of thing pause dur short without it being some pause dur short other
0	exactly
0	exactly
0	secondary thing happening pause dur short which is it
0	that s like that s the massive problem with it
0	yeah that s why it s so stigmatised
0	yeah pause dur short exactly
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i used to like draw grids like craaaaa
0	did you pause dur short that s funny
0	yeah
0	no i ve head that one my auntie told me about that one pause dur short that people do that when they re stressed pause dur short i draw point coin signs like
0	money signs pause dur short which tells a lot about me vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	that s what i doodle
0	dreams of money or
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short they do that
0	has intellectual trunc con trunc conversation and i just unclear want unclear
0	they just wanted company they re just lonely and they ve got so much money

1	no
1	all them years ago pause dur short and selling organic stuff and whole food that was that was good weren t it
1	strangely enough people were only just thinking about what they were eating

1	i don t know
1	you don t know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	what about your job that the the thing you did before you were erm retired and erm you re an instrument technician now can you tell me what that entailed
1	yes anything from pressure gauges to control systems mostly pneumatic but some of it electronic
1	what part of the job did you like the best
1	all of it
1	really vocal desc laugh can you trunc spl trunc stipulate you liked absolutely all of it
1	i enjoyed it all
1	yeah
1	to the point where i actually left twenty four years almost to the day that i went in and it felt as though i d literally been there a week
1	oh that s a wonderful experience isn t it
1	yeah
1	what about the people you worked with
1	no i d sooner not talk about them
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh i mean that
1	right okay
1	there are some i will talk about there are some i won t
1	yeah well if you can tell me about some of the characters you work with that would be good
1	what like like the bare knuckle fighter that used to be there
1	really
1	fought with people like jack dempsey who was one of the world champions pause dur short he was just a character pause dur short but there were lots of people there were the biggest problem was the fact that i worked day shifts and there were people worked what they called twelve hour shifts and they literally were they used to do two days two nights so you used to see a whole range of different people all the time
1	right
1	and i think that s probably what helped
1	yeah
1	but some of the people i actually worked with i d sooner not talk about because i didn t like them very much
1	no no
1	and i had to put up with them
1	yeah mm i well i when i was nursing i had people like that and it was a bit like you
1	mm
1	you were on shifts
1	mm yeah
1	when you re nursing and you think oh i ve got to put up with her
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i know
1	you know for a
1	that s right
1	and and and and then i think well that s okay cos next week i m gonna be on a different ward and then
1	yeah
1	she s gonna be somewhere else
1	yeah
1	and hopefully i ll get somebody nice
1	yeah
1	erm
1	well that s right well this was one particular character i worked with for twenty years in the same room
1	yeah really
1	and i couldn t pause dur short i i it still rankles with me the amount of the amount of
1	really
1	work i had to do
1	right
1	because of his inability to do the job properly
1	oh that s really hard isn t it
1	and pause dur short i m not racist in any way
1	no
1	but he was a west indian
1	was he
1	and he thought he d learn the job very quickly and he never really did learn the job
1	right right
1	so er that and that s why i don t really want to talk about him
1	no
1	in particular
1	no well we can
1	but
1	steer on to other subjects while you were doing this job that you enjoyed so much for so many years what what what did you do in your leisure time
1	cars
1	ah right and you re keen on cars obviously
1	mm not really
1	but you were
1	i i have been because i had a car i i i still have it it s my mg i love it
1	oh right
1	i also have a range rover which i built rebuilt mechanically
1	right
1	i thoroughly enjoyed doing that
1	right
1	and languishing in the back of the garage is my mother s old ford
1	right
1	which i ve been trying to get at since nineteen eighty
1	so you ve got to make a bit of space to get there have you
1	no time is the
1	time yeah
1	and stop
1	right
1	i ve gotta stop being bone idle
1	vocal desc laugh well you re hardly bone idle being here in a working party are you
1	no but er erm as you vocal desc laugh probably realise my stock answer is no vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well the thing is about coming out i mean trunc everyo trunc everyone here unclear well unclear engineers er all
1	trunc b trunc
1	all work a lot on their own
1	yeah
1	in er and to come out and do this it s great
1	it
1	that they can get to talk
1	trunc i trunc it s the company i come for
1	yeah
1	as much as i don t mind the hard work
1	no no i m sure you don t
1	i mean it s it s good fun
1	no anon nametype m type name says you work very hard
1	well
1	if if you re very very hard working
1	well this is the thing
1	yeah
1	about the job i did
1	yeah
1	the fact that a lot of the time i did nothing
1	yeah
1	but when there was work to be done it got done
1	yeah yeah
1	and i worked very
1	yeah
1	i mean it was not uncommon for me to go home at night and get called back in at ten o clock
1	yeah
1	and work through to five o clock the next morning
1	yeah well people will
1	er
1	keep asking you if they know you re gonna produce the goods won t they
1	well that s right and
1	er
1	there were certain people there who would only ask for me
1	right yeah
1	because they knew the job would be done and it would be done properly
1	yeah
1	and
1	mm
1	i suppose the work ethic i got came out of what i did when i first left school
1	oh
1	which was clinical pathology
1	oh right
1	you didn t know that did trunc y trunc
1	no i didn t
1	vocal desc laugh
1	no i didn t so you worked for the police then did you
1	no
1	no
1	clinical trunc p trunc
1	clinical clinical
1	i worked
1	pathology
1	in a hospital
1	ah right trunc s trunc
1	counting blood cells
1	right
1	collecting blood about three years doing bacteriology
1	right
1	so
1	don t you think sometimes when you get your blood tested these days that you can be just under the bar for something
1	mm
1	and and you know you may say thyroid take thyroid did you test for thyroid or er
1	i don t well i
1	you can t remember
1	i mostly did haematology which was
1	right
1	literally blood cell counting
1	right okay
1	literally by eye
1	really
1	down a microscope
1	oh lord
1	counting chambers diluted to blood pause dur short put in your counting chambers put it under a microscope and counted the cells that you could see at a given area
1	and has that affected you eyesight in later life do you think
1	no i don t think it has i ve been i think i ve been very lucky considering how long i was spent doing that
1	right
1	and when you re doing bacteriology there are times when you sit and look for an hour down the microscope at blank trunc sur trunc plank erm slides
1	right

1	mm
1	there s only
1	yeah
1	so much you can do it s very limited

1	trunc ye trunc yeah yeah the
1	in the field since i left the year before
1	vocal desc laugh that s right well i mean it s the same i go to quite a few shows
1	yeah
1	up around erm anon type place and anon type place and around that area
1	right
1	and because i meet the same people it s like the anon type place model engineers it s
1	yeah
1	good company
1	yeah it is good company
1	erm it it it also leads you out into other things like last sunday we went to the nec to the classic
1	right
1	car show
1	right right
1	which was quite nice we went up on the coach so we had no worry about driving
1	oh yes yes
1	and we were dropped off within five minutes of it all and the thing is i m also a member of a car club
1	yes well we are in unofficially of the austin seven club
1	mm
1	it s not really a club but
1	no it s

1	no but i actually belong to the ford sidevalve owners club
1	oh do you right
1	and i m the area contact for them
1	right oh do you
1	which actually throws up odd things like pause dur short the other week i went down to anon type place to anon type place to look at a car to verify that it was what it said it was
1	oh right yeah
1	so that the chap can get the registration done
1	yeah
1	which is quite interesting
1	yeah
1	the people you meet and the cars you look at
1	yeah yeah
1	so since i ve been retired my life has become much more interesting
1	yeah
1	cos most of the car work i did before i retired was with a friend of mine who was actually a repairer
1	right right
1	and a lot of it was towing cars in for him to repair
1	yeah yeah trunc s trunc
1	er
1	erm so erm your car now your b
1	mm
1	can you tell me erm have you got much more to do on it or is it is it sort of all up together maintained and spotless
1	er it s all up together but it needs a good coat of paint
1	does it right
1	erm the trunc th trunc thing about that is the fact that i smashed it up
1	right oh did you oh
1	in nineteen eighty eight
1	right
1	going to work one morning
1	did you
1	i m lucky to be here actually
1	yeah
1	but that s beside the point
1	yeah
1	since then it s had a complete new body shell put on
1	right right
1	and it was one of the early heritage shells that came er literally as a body shell all the unclear bolt mark unclear parts
1	right
1	were missing
1	yes
1	so i ve i ve actually rebuilt it up from
1	right
1	every nut and bolt and screw
1	right
1	rivet that s gone in
1	yeah
1	i know it because i put it in there
1	yeah yeah
1	so er
1	well we ve got something in common then i had an accident in nineteen seventy eight
1	yeah
1	well that s ten years before you vocal desc cough er
1	mm
1	it actually wasn t my fault i was driving to work in the morning
1	mm
1	i waited in the drive for erm one of my colleagues and er he hadn t turned up i used give him a lift and er had i gone he was late and had i gone
1	mm
1	at the time i should have gone i wouldn t have met the other man on the road
1	no that s true
1	you know but because i waiting for trunc t trunc he was called anon nametype m type name
1	mm
1	i was waiting for anon nametype m type name
1	mm
1	i had the accident and he just came towards me overtaking another car
1	mm
1	and hit me in the front spun the mini round and the petrol tank burst into flames and i was trapped in a burning car well
1	not nice
1	i nearly died erm
1	mm
1	went to anon type place hospital erm pause dur short it s funny actually trunc y trunc you feel like a bit cheated about having an accident on the way to work in the morning you think well this should be happening at night when i come out of the pub when i ve had a few to drink
1	yeah
1	do you know what i mean vocal desc laugh but
1	yes
1	i mean that s what you say in those days
1	well that s right
1	when you could have a drink and go to the pub
1	well that s right
1	now you wouldn t
1	no
1	now you i mean
1	no
1	i certainly don t i don t drink at all now
1	no
1	hardly at all
1	well i don t either i mean
1	mm
1	er anon nametype m type name would say you re always er even at lunchtime here anon nametype m type name i ll have a
1	yeah
1	an orange juice
1	yeah yeah
1	but that is because the last job i did pause dur short was strictly er it was classified as category a safety so i used to be
1	oh right
1	and we had to be sober at nine o clock
1	yeah
1	zero rated
1	yeah so anon nametype m type name had to do that
1	you know
1	when he was going on the track
1	yeah that s right
1	every every track he went on you know he had to go on the track at night
1	yeah
1	he couldn t have a drink you know
1	no that s right
1	used to say do you want a a drink no can t have a drink
1	no but my accident wasn t another car
1	no
1	it was an incompetent council
1	oh really
1	who decided to put a pedestrian reserve in the middle of the road
1	yeah
1	without due warning
1	so you went over it did you
1	i i went into it and
1	into it
1	the car just stopped
1	oh
1	and in the back of the car i trunc ca trunc got the photographs of what it looked like vocal desc laugh there s a railing straight down the centre of
1	right
1	the headlight
1	right
1	but had i not had a seatbelt on
1	right
1	i would have been thrown out pause dur short but it actually did affect me physically because the seatbelt wasn t tight pause dur short and when i had my heart attack a few months ago
1	yeah
1	i didn t realise it was that
1	right
1	until it wouldn t the pain wouldn t go away and it was getting worse
1	oh i see yeah
1	because i d suffered this pain on the trunc ster trunc
1	oh i see yeah
1	under the sternum
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	which was a muscular skeletal muscular thing
1	yeah having a heart attack is a very weird thing to sort of diagnose because there are so many things it could be like indigestion or
1	yeah
1	did i stretch up too far to put something down
1	right
1	from the shelf yesterday you know
1	trunc ye trunc yeah well yes it s it s just depends on how many symptoms you have
1	right what were your symptoms then
1	extreme pain
1	yeah er just extreme pain
1	and and
1	in the heart area
1	trunc r trunc radiating from the sternum
1	it s right from the sternum
1	and it wouldn t go away
1	anything down at your arm they always say
1	no
1	down the left arm
1	no
1	don t they
1	no it depends
1	palpitations
1	no
1	no headaches
1	no
1	nausea
1	no
1	no
1	just pain and general weakness
1	right
1	and knowing that it was something serious
1	right
1	it was something up here
1	yeah
1	in my brain
1	yeah
1	that told me this but i saw my father had a heart attack you see
1	did you yeah
1	he just walked into me and said i don t feel well and i felt his hands and looked at him and said no you go back to bed i ll get the doctor in
1	right right
1	this doctor said i think he s only indigestion
1	right
1	it was diagnosed that he d had a heart attack
1	right
1	that morning
1	right
1	so
1	oh right what are doing on time here oh only another two minutes to go anon nametype m type name

1	that s why
1	i think he said he already had an operation on the other hand
1	oh right
1	and took about five to five to six weeks to recover

1	and what should it be
1	yeah it wasn t too bad i mean it could could have been a bit better but it wasn t bad pause dur short yeah wasn t bad but whereas i should be about when i wake up in the morning about four trunc so trunc something like that
1	mm
1	i trunc sh trunc it s probably about seven pause dur short so erm pause dur short i should er i ve got to keep an eye on it but i let i ve let it go recently i ve let i i ve let it go because i haven t erm
1	well because of christmas or
1	christmas erm pause dur short yeah but i shall focus on it again
1	mm
1	and er pause dur short yeah i ll focus on it again pause dur short so i went to the doctor s i left the doctor s and er what did i do then erm i think i came home and er
1	mm
1	saw you pause dur short erm pause dur short i think i had a coffee and a pause dur short and a bun vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and er vocal desc laugh then erm
1	what what about that canvassing you know you it didn t work out because somebody didn t turn up and you ve got to do it tomorrow
1	yes i went to canvassing i canvass on behalf of the green party and er pause dur short i turned up to er canvass on behalf of anon nametype f type name who s the leader of the green party and erm pause dur short but er pause dur short i don t think i got the time and the place wrong but no one turned up pause dur short erm
1	did he he er give you any explanation
1	well i can t i haven t yet contacted the person who er pause dur short who erm pause dur short who asked me who contacted me in the first place i ve just got an email or not an email erm a text through from another councillor to tell me
1	mm
1	erm the telephone number of the person that they believe who co ordinates anon nametype f type name s
1	mm
1	campaign so i shall text them to say pause dur short is it you i m supposed to be speaking to erm and er if so
1	why why are they doing why are they doing this so early cos the election s in may isn t it pause dur long
1	well
1	isn t it in may
1	probably but i mean why not now pause dur short it s a continuous thing pause dur short it starts off if you
1	so what
1	you had a look
1	what s the point of canvassing you try and basically persuade people to vote for you i mean is that what you do
1	well yes yes it s to
1	and you re deciding how you re gonna vote
1	er you meet different types of people you meet the person who says i don t wanna know about it pause dur short f off and you get really agitated and annoyed pause dur short then you meet people who erm go oh yes wonderful i voted i will always vote green fantastic pause dur short then you meet people who er pause dur short who ask you loads of questions pause dur short they drive you mad pause dur short question after question and er you can get trapped by these people erm just talking and talking and talking so i generally
1	what do you mean trapped
1	trunc s trunc
1	you mean just spending too
1	well they ll go on and on
1	too much time
1	they re trying to be clever and prove a point
1	are they
1	and they re probably very very lonely people who who never get people walking up to them and saying hello with a smiling face and saying how are you
1	event desc unintelligible
1	and trunc wh trunc what s your opinion and er you know so they they want a friend and that s nice but if you re going to try and reach a lot of people you can t pause dur short like a doctor pause dur short you can t devote that much time to to them er but you can er but that s all part of learning how to canvass well i think er knowing how to let them go how to let them go feeling good about themselves erm i normally say well look er er and and i m trunc qui trunc er look er you re obviously very interested in this which is fantastic er i would go and look on the website and i will give them the website details and they ll hopefully we we ve got another supporter and i say to to trunc th trunc as well would you be prepared to give an hour of your time a week to something if you care about the planet and the people on it an hour of your time just licking envelopes or or putting out some flyers er but you know you could do something because you meet people and broaden your horizons learn a bit about ecological er issues peace issues erm
1	mm
1	so er yeah there s that type and there s
1	well trunc don trunc what s the percentage of people who vote like in the last election
1	erm pause dur short i wouldn t know
1	no
1	i wouldn t know i think it s in the last general election
1	yeah
1	i would think it s pretty small i i would think probably i i don t know i would hazard a guess and say possibly sixty percent possibly i don t know but that s only a guess and that trunc cou trunc those statistics are easily found out nowadays with computers
1	mm it would be easy to find out yeah
1	yes pause dur long what about the background noise of the er where we re recording will that affect the quality of the recording
1	well it s not that loud
1	right okay
1	mm we ve got this little er thing here
1	yeah
1	who you can see er pause dur short i don t know i i don t think so
1	okay pause dur long
1	but erm i mean they pause dur short be able to hear you see every time the the voice speaks it spikes
1	yes
1	so i don t think so yeah it should be alright
1	yeah so erm yeah well er i went out canvassing that was er this evening and i met an old girlfriend of mine and erm it was very nice to see her she s a rock climber and runs a women s group for rock climbing women
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh she s won awards for that er through her service to the community and erm er and i was very pleased for her she was very very pause dur short proud it was an achievement for her to win that award pause dur short er it was not only great for her to win it but it was great of er people in our society to to er help people attain those sort of achievements and feel good about themselves and i and i think that s a wonderful thing erm yeah i think she was the argus awards she was er pause dur short erm nominated for those and er won one of those pause dur short so that was good erm

1	i wonder why they situated it out here outside of anon type place rather than inside do you think it s a bit cheaper for the rents and trunc th trunc

1	well it s not actually trunc ca trunc cambridge university it s cambridge university press

1	i mean people could call us normal but there again how wrong would they be pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	well they re
1	how wrong could i could they be
1	i mean the most interesting fact is that i think about these interviews that get recorded and sent to to these people at cambridge press is that people really don t tell them what they re thinking pause dur short i mean people all play the game don t they
1	well it s not really it s trunc i trunc you ve got it in your head it s like an interview pause dur short you know i m not interviewing you

0	i will
1	throw them out and
1	there we go
1	see how we go
1	well thank you very much for talking to me today anon nametype m type name
1	my pleasure
1	and what i d like to ask you i m looking at your form here is that you were a tv producer and i find that absolutely fascinating could you tell me more about the sort of programmes you produced
1	yes well er well trunc le trunc let s go back to the beginning since this is gonna take more than a few minutes we could fill it out erm my father was a teacher he was born and brought up in the south of england he was a teacher of biology at anon type place school
1	right
1	and his interests were apart from biology photography pause dur short and so i was brought up in a family where my mother was a botanist where we would go for nature walks a lot and er dad would have his camera and bit by bit things brushed off on me first of all learning to see things that other people
1	yeah
1	would walk past trunc th trunc they just wouldn t
1	mm
1	notice erm seeing detail er one particular memory erm i have was father taking me for a walk in anon type place woods which is not far from anon type place and he stopped and he said er do you see that tree over there about fifty yards away i said trunc w trunc but of course and he say well you see the trunk and i said but of course i can see the trunk and he said do you see that moth that s on the bark of that trunk and i said you ve gotta be joking i mean from fifty yards how do you see a moth anyway he said okay well trunc l trunc let s go closer and closer and closer and when you see the moth stop and point it out so we go closer and closer and closer and we get right up to the tree and i haven t seen anything and i said there isn t a moth and he said there is so i look and i look and i still see nothing and then he lifted his walking stick and he pointed right up to what i eventually noticed was a triangular shape that was only slightly different in colour to the background it was virtually a perfect camouflage match pause dur short and i thought that was absolutely incredible how from fifty yards away could you see such a thing and it was only later that i realised that as a biologist he d studied this woodland for about five years in detail knew everything that existed there and where it was and what the habits where and so on pause dur short and of course these camouflaged moths have to be invisible to their predators because they fly at night and in the daytime they ve gotta go somewhere and birds come along and they find them so erm he didn t know of course it was there but he had a very good idea that it would be there cos he d seen it there before and so on and so forth and it was experiences like that that helped me use my eyes and of course in that family er background erm my love of nature grew erm he taught me at school er biology at o level and at a level and because of that i had to work hard to make sure i unclear
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	and er he couldn t be seen to be favouring me so he probably
1	mm
1	marked me down a bit i wouldn t be at all surprised
1	yeah
1	so i i found that quite easy so of course i went to university and i did biology there because it was the easiest thing for me and i enjoyed it of course
1	yeah
1	er so at the end of university i had to think okay what am i going to do because until then i was just enjoying life and i decided because of er er of the influence my father had on on photography on my photography that i would go to erm anon type place polytechnic to study a photography three year course which also had a specialism in filming now my father had experimented with filming er again when i was a teenager his his subject was badgers and his interest was to film them because people didn t know much about them the only problem was of course they only come out at night
1	mm
1	when it s dark
1	uhu
1	they have amazing sense of hearing and of smell so you ve got lots of problems to solve anyway he solved all those and er resulting film appeared on the bbc in bristol er introduced by peter scott and er he used to do a number of radio programmes as well er nature parliament and country questions answering questions
1	yes
1	that the public had sent in and so on and so forth and i would go up with him sometimes just to sort of see what it was all about
1	mm
1	unclear so i was i was interested in that and anyway having gone through the university and having gone through this erm er course in london at anon type place polytechnic er i was faced with the obvious question of okay now are you going to be a perpetual student or are you actually going to get a job and i was looking at adverts and i saw erm an advert from the bbc pause dur short and i thought oh this looks interesting this was erm to come in as a production assistant to work on educational programmes for schools erm based in london and i thought oh unclear this would be interesting erm only of course i know nothing about the electronic studio side of production
1	uhu
1	only having had an introduction into film work pause dur short anyway i went for the interview pause dur short and erm before i heard the result the following week because these adverts appeared i think it was in the telegraph erm every wednesday or something so i i i was looking and then i saw this advert for the bbc to work as a production assistant in bristol to work on natural history programmes pause dur short and i thought well i know much more about this vocal desc laugh than i do about the
1	how amazing
1	the london thing
1	yeah
1	so i ll go in for this this ll
1	mm
1	be interesting so i was interviewed for that and er to my great surprise erm i got a letter from er the school television department in london to say erm er we we can t offer you this job of production assistant level er because of your lack of experience but we would like to offer you a job as a researcher again with school programmes
1	mm
1	er on a variety of subjects and so on and a few days later i got a a letter from the bbc in bristol er that said er you know er thank you for coming for interview etcetera etcetera etcetera erm er we er we don t think er you have enough experience to come in at production assistant level but we would like to offer you the job as a researcher on natural history programmes in bristol
1	vocal desc laugh yes vocal desc laugh
1	and i remember that the salary was er twelve hundred and twelve hundred and seventy five pounds or something and er in london it was thirteen hundred and something because of the london weighting etcetera etcetera but basically
1	mm
1	it was the same so i trunc h trunc i had the privilege of this this problem
1	yeah
1	if you like and i decided that well the bristol one i know much more about but really what would be really exciting for me would be to learn about studio production pause dur short so i accepted the london job
1	right
1	and so i went to the bbc in london and for thirteen years i learnt the craft of erm television production directing producing erm going from researcher to production assistant to assistant producer to producer to executive producer and and working with erm fast turnover programmes short programmes with low budgets
1	right
1	you get a huge amount of experience in a relatively short period of time and i was er very lucky to have done er studio productions erm recorded as live on a whole variety of subjects
1	mm
1	which included biology erm but all kinds of other things er general studies which in those days was erm anything thought to be important that wasn t on a syllabus and so that was you know
1	uhu
1	sex and drugs and religion and religion and politics
1	mm
1	and and all kinds of wonderful things
1	mm
1	but eventually i had to think well this is all very good all very fascinating but isn t it perhaps time i sort of specialised in something erm and the one thing that frustrated me with erm school television was the size of the budget and the length of the programme erm i wanted to do something that was a bit more ambitious and erm a bigger budget like fifty minute programmes and i thought well really i m now ready to do some natural history programmes but bringing to an outer history unit in bristol some wider experience than
1	yes
1	most of the people there had so that probably i would have a chance when when a a job came up pause dur short and a job did come up and that was to er produce programmes on a series called the living planet where they were record trunc w trunc er were looking for people er to join a team for a three year project multimillion pounds with david attenborough
1	oh right
1	erm and i thought no i won t get that er but at the same time er there was a job for a producer on erm a long running series called the world about us and i thought oh that s more like it er so i went in for that and erm had a long interview and and er er they said could you trunc sh trunc could you wait outside and so on cos i think i must have been the last candidate and they wanted to talk and they hauled me in and they said erm well we re very impressed with the stuff that you ve done etcetera etcetera but you haven t done a fifty minute programme before er you haven t er you know written a fifty minute script erm mm we we don t really think erm er we should give you this particular post and then they said but as you may be aware er we re recruiting for the new attenborough big attenborough project erm would you like it
1	vocal desc laugh oh that was a bit of a stunner
1	and that was extraordinary the reasoning was erm because david attenborough was there and there was an executive producer unclear in charge unclear with huge experience erm the key structure of the long programmes was heavily influenced by david attenborough himself pause dur short er this was in the days when these projects were very much his projects
1	right
1	whereas now he narrates other people s work and all trunc oth trunc everyone thinks they re his as well vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	erm and therefore the element they were in doubt about as far as my experience was concerned was basically covered by the experience of the existing team and er other aspects they thought i could do er so they offered it to me and i took it pause dur short erm so i spent the next three years working on that which was fantastic and then what did i do er then i was editor of a series called nature which was live television er with with filmed recorded inserts er stories in in that er then i was editor of er the natural world very ironic because i wasn t accepted to be a producer erm on erm that series which er the previous name but they changed it to the natural world but then i was made editor of the entire series vocal desc laugh
1	oh my goodness
1	erm but in a funny way er then you re you re still not you re still not writing er fifty minute scripts
1	no no
1	you re looking after er mm mm a rather different kind of project pause dur short and then finally the job of head of the natural history unit came up and erm i was encouraged to go in for it and i looked at the candidates and i thought god i don t want him to take over and i don t want him to take over vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	er er and i thought mm well i m not sure i really want it but i don t want to be ruled by them and then maybe if i don t go in for it one day i m gonna curse myself you really should have done that because you only get
1	mm
1	this opportunity once er so i went in for it and after an awful lot of humming and harring er by other people in charge they decided to give it to me erm so i did that and then pause dur short i think twenty five years to the day after joining the bbc which happened to be on my birthday erm i thought well that s the time to leave because i d sort of done it
1	yes
1	and i didn t want to step down from being head and then making programmes again it s also a difficult issue for the new head and and
1	it s it s
1	so on
1	true yeah
1	er trunc th trunc just get out
1	mm
1	er enjoy it so i got out and then i joined a er a commercial television er production company in london i wanted to get back to london er called anon type place erm the boss said to me er we want to set up a natural history wing from scratch erm we think you could do it would you like to do it and i said yes because this was totally different
1	mm
1	but involved the same people i d met all over the world doing natural history and so on erm but it was it was commercial it was a very different thing i was offered a three year er fixed contract meaning at the end it would end whatever happened erm and my job was to set this up to buy up film from all over the world that either hadn t been used or was getting tired and needed to be reinvigorated turned into new programmes and so on and so forth and to commission new stuff and er i did that and they seemed to be very pleased and at the end of it erm er i knew that was it because i d proved to myself that financially it made no sense to originate completely new types of programmes erm which would cost a lot of money er where there s a risk factor as there always is in natural history filming you know things can go wrong and so on and so forth
1	yeah
1	and if you work for a commercial company you ve got to deliver and i proved that you could get highly saleable productions from existing sources and and catalogues and library catalogues and so on and so forth build up an immense library for very little money in comparison to doing the new stuff erm i knew that they knew that they preferred that so i went
1	uhu
1	that was it and then after a number of years of of doing consultant work with other broadcasters in places like new zealand and the states i thought well i ve sort of done it erm i m only er going round and round and round and the programmes are getting ever less interesting to me erm why not get back to my original interest which was photography erm i was able to retire so i did and i m still doing it still doing the photography
1	oh right
1	and the photography pause dur short is sort of abstract pictures taken in nature where you ve got interesting shapes or forms sculptural shapes or forms patterns and so on erm but within these abstracts you can see erm faces or you can see shapes that indicate that it s a sort of animal or something of that sort
1	yes
1	so each each one has that sort of theme to it and the idea is er to have exhibitions of of these pictures and get particularly children er preferably families but with children in them to come and for the kids to see these things and to work out what they re looking at cos they have so much imagination it s absolutely amazing and therefore to get them interested in going out into into the wilds going out into nature i mean it could be a park it could be garden it doesn t have to be an exotic place and see if they can trunc f trunc spot images of faces or or of creatures in in in rocks in wooden shapes in erm forms of leaves and so on and so forth so it encourages them to go out and and see nature in a slightly different way
1	yeah
1	and appreciate nature and that s where it goes sort of full circle back from where i started and my parents took me out and i got interested in nature and this is sort of my way of encouraging youngsters to do
1	right
1	the same sort of thing
1	oh right
1	and erm fortunately er the anon type place museum here erm got very interested in the idea of an exhibition which er i would hold jointly with my brother er or or one of my brothers the anon type place brother who is an artist and sculptor and i m a photographer so
1	right
1	we ve got and he was of course inspired by nature in his way and he s expressed it in his way and we re combining this into an exhibition called anon type place er which is going to come on in a year s time
1	oh right that s exiting
1	so we we ve gone we ve gone the full circle
1	yes
1	in anon type place cos the influences the anon type place on me although i was born in anon type place at the age of two i was brought to anon type place and er my parents rented a thatched cottage in er anon type place
1	right
1	which is still there
1	oh yes
1	erm and then moved into anon type place and he was working of course at the school erm and then when i left school i went to pause dur short anon type place university and then to the er er photographic course in anon type place and then of course i stayed in anon type place erm then went to anon type place and went back to anon type place erm my wife died er eight years ago suddenly and i had to reassess things and after a while i i got fed up with london i wanted to move away from trunc b trunc the the flat we had there and so on vocal desc cough and thought well where do i wanna go and i thought well i really ought to go somewhere where i ve got connection so that was either but anon type place where i left at the age of two that wasn t really a memory erm the university of anon type place is not the warmest place on earth but it s a lovely place
1	mm
1	although it s changed completely as a result of the oil which happened after i left there erm anon type place er which i wanted to get away from at least for a while or anon type place and my my brother had moved from his work at anon type place and so on he was based in anon type place he came to anon type place and he seemed to like it so i thought well and then i found this house and i say oh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i like this vocal desc laugh
1	yes fantastic
1	yeah
1	position
1	it is a fantastic position and i was lucky having done what i ve done that i
1	mm
1	had a property in anon type place so it s selling a property in anon type place
1	oh yes
1	erm you ve got enough money to buy it
1	yes
1	so erm it needed a lot of work er cos it was owned for at least a decade by erm a couple who were both doctors with teenage children and having teenage children and being very busy people they didn t do an awful lot to keep this place going and it needed
1	oh
1	needed help
1	yes
1	erm but i was very interested er to try that out and and do things and i did and that s now done erm so i m i m quite pleased really it is a nice spot
1	very
1	and it
1	very nice spot
1	mm mm
1	so tell me a little bit more about the work you re going to be putting into the exhibition i know you said it s making children or people look at shapes and and so on
1	mm
1	within the
1	mm
1	erm within the exhibition and within the the work erm i don t know whether anon nametype f type name told you but i did my er degree near in trunc f trunc degree in fine art about four years ago
1	really
1	and erm i got
1	that s interesting
1	a distinction for my photography vocal desc laugh
1	good for you
1	vocal desc laugh
1	good for you
1	vocal desc laugh but i didn t even know
1	yeah

1	right right right
1	erm
1	er mm
1	it it and and i erm i m i m i wouldn t mind the chance to show it to you actually but i erm i i do sort of abstract i m very close up things and and distort so that so they re distorted to a point
1	mm mm
1	i don t actually photoshop or anything like that
1	right right right
1	i do straightforward
1	i don t either yeah
1	and but erm i did go to the home of dylan thomas recently er er i was going to a funeral actually we were in wales and we went to dylan thomas s house and i took a photograph from above his house in laugharne onto the estuary erm and i d just to show it to somebody who s got some knowledge of photography erm and i m really pleased with it and i i ve got
1	mm
1	two large erm one s a canvas and the other is just an ordinary erm trunc phot trunc photograph in a frame
1	mm
1	but i d love er you to look at it and tell me

1	yeah
1	human shapes
1	all these sort of things
1	yeah pause dur short are marvellous
1	what i m
1	erm
1	careful to do is not to label them with what i think they are
1	no exactly
1	or pause dur short er er give things away cos people interpret in their own way
1	yeah
1	and that s absolutely right
1	yeah
1	erm i think that one s fairly obviously but some are more obvious than others as to what they are
1	yes exactly well when we re just looking at some erm barks and erm seeing erm patterns and disturbances in the bark that can emulate some other type of erm
1	faces or
1	face yeah and that s really attractive isn t it
1	the face yeah in that bright colours
1	that s like an abstract design erm in
1	er yeah there s an eye and a
1	an eye yes yes
1	etcetera erm
1	yes yes i see yes i see
1	yeah
1	yeah er

1	yes
1	erm but but i mean they re very quick these are the sort of the
1	oh yes that s a wonderful profile

1	that sort of marching across
1	yes
1	the desert the kind of bear like
1	i see it s it s
1	creature i suppose
1	i see it as a man crouching in despair
1	or
1	erm
1	i think
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it could be
1	it s whatever
1	or
1	you think it is and that s all to do with perception isn t it
1	of course it is
1	er and people
1	of course it is
1	people perceive all sorts of things
1	yeah er
1	completely differently
1	trunc th trunc that s my pink elephant
1	oh right
1	and that s my white elephant erm
1	right
1	quite extraordinary
1	yeah
1	the things you can just
1	i love the
1	find
1	colour of the sand in that one
1	mm
1	it is sand isn t it

1	yes
1	erm and that s obviously birdlike
1	yes it is birdlike
1	again it s just eroded granite i mean that s all it is
1	yeah
1	that s that s not a hippo that s anon type place that s local that one
1	is it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	this one looks like trunc some trunc er the trunc beg trunc er a horrible lizard well there are two lizards together maybe sort of or or trunc tortoi trunc erm or turtle head er possibly a turtle head erm pause dur short but erm
1	to me that was more shark like but
1	shark like
1	erm er
1	oh right how interesting
1	trunc th trunc that s the eye and that s
1	oh right
1	the mouth
1	yes
1	and that s the snout i trunc mea trunc that s why i took it
1	yeah yeah
1	but again most people wouldn t wouldn t see anything in this at all
1	and this this looks like a cave drawing erm er er er er you know an early cave drawing erm but erm i erm i ought to stand up and look down on it really
1	i er you should in a way yeah
1	erm i can almost see a bird this way
1	yeah
1	that way it almost looks like erm that s the head of a woman really and they re running but and it s
1	it s a dancer
1	a dancer yes
1	yeah er or a running hare
1	yes oh yes a running hare now i see it

1	it s just there yeah
1	er it s a it s a mussel but it s a
1	yes
1	trunc nurs trunc er nursery of very young mussels
1	yeah
1	in the cracks er
1	and that looks like it s an early chinese painting vocal desc laugh
1	it does look a chinese
1	yeah
1	it does look chinese
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but that s supposed to be mother and calf
1	yeah
1	i mean the erm a dolphin or a whale or something of that sort swimming with all the water
1	yeah
1	and but it s a sandstone cliff
1	very nice
1	erm
1	lovely colours that could almost be a henry moore there
1	this is the henry moore
1	and here er well both of them
1	trunc cer trunc very massive
1	yes
1	isn t it
1	yes it is
1	the hand and er the funny eye
1	yeah
1	or or picasso sort of thing erm pause dur short but yeah there s there s one can look at these things in so many different ways and you half close your eyes here
1	oh wow
1	you ve almost got two eyes a nose and a mouth
1	yeah
1	but no that s just er
1	erm that makes me think of erm i m trying to think of his name now the very weird man
1	dali
1	dali
1	yeah
1	because he
1	yeah
1	er he sort of
1	yeah
1	he dismembered things
1	did crazy things
1	and put the yes
1	yes
1	crazy things
1	he took noses and
1	yes he did
1	vocal desc laugh yes
1	yes that was a
1	yeah
1	salvador dali crikey
1	but that i find absolutely extraordinary i mean er trunc th trunc
1	yeah
1	this is what i call the unclear citation unclear graveyard
1	yeah
1	erm that whale on its side and that one with its fin
1	yeah
1	and yet it is simply of course eroded granite
1	yes yeah
1	i mean the shapes are just
1	it
1	unbelievable
1	yeah
1	unbelievable i think
1	yeah
1	erm nature is quite extraordinary now that is the same picture
1	yeah
1	just turned
1	yeah
1	and there are a number of examples like that erm pause dur short where you turn them a different way and suddenly they become something else
1	yeah
1	er that s like one of these sort of visual tests can you vocal desc laugh can you see vocal desc laugh the outline
1	yes
1	of a flying bird erm some can but quite a lot of people can t see it at all
1	or or it might be
1	or simply don t notice it
1	easily be looking down from space
1	oh yes it could be huge
1	trunc ye trunc yeah
1	like the scale
1	yeah this
1	this could be a city
1	yes it could
1	i mean all these could be buildings
1	yeah
1	or something
1	it could be
1	yeah yeah erm i ve got an awful lot of dogs erm
1	yes i can see the dog there
1	that s more alsatian and this is
1	yeah
1	poodle
1	oh definitely a poodle
1	erm or a the chinese character but
1	yeah no i
1	i see it as a i
1	i like a
1	straightaway
1	like the poodle
1	i thought it s a poodle well i like that er but that s an old dog sleeping semi sleeping and that s quite extraordinary
1	it is
1	and that cos without that you haven t got a picture
1	no exactly
1	it s just like it s one of these
1	yeah
1	it just happens to be in the right place
1	there s an old dog alright
1	erm yeah and so
1	again
1	and so it goes on but you get the idea
1	yeah yeah
1	erm oh god i mean that is extraordinary too
1	yes
1	i mean that s my tiger i only had it it s just sandstone the way it s eroded
1	the way that to me is definitely is a mouse and the way it s
1	yes yes
1	there is a very
1	yeah
1	humanistic mouse
1	it oh it is it is yes definitely
1	you know
1	definitely yeah
1	erm
1	but with the stripes
1	yes trunc exa trunc yes absolutely
1	has to be a tiger
1	a tiger yeah
1	yeah unclear
1	that s a bird
1	that s a bird
1	a penguin i suppose
1	sort of the yeah
1	a sort of penguin
1	i mean it s closest to a penguin i think
1	yeah
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah erm
1	oh we ve got a seal again
1	and so it goes on and so it goes on and that s
1	and the owl at the end
1	that s that one
1	oh
1	so
1	oh thank you for that
1	i m gonna do another one

1	right
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh i m
1	yeah
1	i m absolutely intrigued
1	unclear
1	i m so glad that i came
1	well vocal desc laugh
1	what a wonderful erm what a wonderful interview
1	well it is a bit different the erm
1	it is
1	there s my my interest er being interested in photography erm you think well what kind of photography er and that is pause dur short if you re interested in in nature pause dur short trying to take erm pictures of plants or animals that are anything like as good as what other people have done
1	yes
1	and in this day and age when if an editor wants a picture of a of a blackbird just goes on the internet and does all these all all the libraries and are now up in
1	mm
1	er up in the cloud they can in no time at all get the finest pictures ever taken of whatever it is
1	yes
1	they re looking for
1	yes absolutely
1	so what is the point other than the sheer enjoyment of doing so erm going to huge lengths to try and take a picture that isn t as good vocal desc laugh
1	absolutely yeah i i
1	as other people and having this interest in in in camouflage and detail and and art
1	yes
1	er my interest was to get pictures for the wall
1	yeah
1	erm it s got to be something else and and that natural trunc intere trunc interest just developed and developed and developed and i don t think you can do that very quickly
1	no
1	actually
1	no you can t
1	and fortunately er not everybody s doing that sort of thing so this collection when it comes down to trunc mm trunc maybe thirty five pictures which are going to be printed this big
1	yes
1	erm i think will interest people because i ve had er two dry runs erm two exhibitions in france we we used to have a house down in the south and it s because of those that i wanted to take it further because
1	mm
1	we would contact schools and the teachers would bring the children and er the children i m talking about ages around about sort of of eleven no the eight up through to about fourteen the interesting period vocal desc laugh
1	yes yes yes
1	er they would come and the trunc t trunc and and teachers would say okay erm go around quietly look at things and decide which erm half a dozen of these pictures er you particularly like
1	yes
1	write these down and erm tell the rest of us why you like them and what you see in them and they were seeing things that of course i hadn t got a clue about at all
1	no
1	and their imagination came out and their interest erm and the extraordinary thing was er to me that they they would come in the week and then at the weekend some of them would drag their parents back
1	yeah
1	to see it and the kids would sort of curate the show they d say mummy or mummy you ve got to see this
1	vocal desc laugh
1	now what do you see in this and trunc th trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	all this kind of thing and it was amazing er and a few of the parents erm afterwards would say erm trunc th trunc this is amazing er the the the child or the children have suddenly got this interest and want to take us out for walks
1	yes
1	erm so that they can find things
1	thing yes
1	and erm they d got their little mobile phone trunc an trunc and so on and er if if they do see something do you think they could email it to you i said but of course er in the end not many people did but a few did er and trunc y trunc you saw these pictures and you you could see what they were what they were driving at what
1	yes
1	they were finding
1	yes
1	erm and i thought that was fantastic
1	yeah
1	really did
1	it is good it is good when it erm sort of frees people s imagination i i found a root once a broken root which looked like a leg and a hip erm and there was a trunc s trunc part of a torso to it it was when i was in the first year at erm anon type place university
1	mm
1	and erm i i took it home and i made a clay shoe to go on it a red clay stiletto heel
1	mm
1	er which i er baked in the oven it was one of those
1	right
1	hobby craft clay things
1	yeah
1	and i stuck it on the end and i put the thing on a back and i hung it in an exhibition in the conference room
1	mm
1	and the principal bought it vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh very good well done well done that s
1	and vocal desc laugh everyone was saying to me anon nametype f type name how much
1	mm mm
1	do you want to put on this the principal s asking how much it is
1	er yeah yeah
1	and i thought well you know when i thought how how much it took me how quick it was to make cos it was a found object
1	yeah
1	but then i d embellished it
1	yeah
1	but then art today is all about the found object and you are actually
1	mm mm mm
1	using the found object in your photography
1	they re all found objects yeah
1	which is fantastic
1	yeah
1	erm anyway you know i asked for what i thought was a reasonable sum
1	mm
1	erm but erm yes i mean a lot of unknown artists ask far too much for their work and erm
1	mm mm
1	it was the first thing i sold erm while i was a student
1	mm
1	but i ve sold a lot more now and a lot of my work is i have a lot of photographs
1	mm
1	erm in my dentist s she s got them on permanent display erm
1	yeah
1	they re all rather weird erm
1	yeah
1	it s anon nametype f type name down near anon type place erm down that side of town
1	mm
1	erm and she s had them er for erm what two or three years now
1	right right
1	erm and every time i go in i trunc di trunc i don t know if you get this with yours i go in in and i see work on the wall and i it s almost like i it trunc don trunc i don t own it anymore it s nothing to do with me
1	yeah yeah
1	it s like a time has elapsed and i ve gone on and i ve been doing other things now and it i trunc pa trunc
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	passed
1	yeah
1	passed by but erm yes it it it was erm yeah it doing the art degree at the age of erm fifty eight i did the art degree fifty eight fifty nine
1	mm
1	erm it was very late to do it but
1	mm mm
1	i m really glad i did it
1	mm
1	because i trunc ex trunc i ve experimented with so much and erm
1	yeah
1	i ve gone back to painting a bit at the moment erm
1	mm
1	but i m i don t i like experimenting i just couldn t say well this is the way i paint or this is the way i do this and i m always gonna do it like this i ve gotta
1	mm
1	keep diversifying
1	mm
1	to keep myself interested really
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	but then it confuses people so they can t identify with you so
1	vocal desc sigh well it depends how abstract you go erm well right here if you
1	mm
1	look at that the two things are connected it it s
1	oh yes
1	it s my brother s work
1	oh is it this
1	yeah
1	here oh it s
1	yeah
1	lovely i i have been
1	and
1	looking at it actually
1	erm pause dur short and without any explanation at all all you can sort of think of is well the sculpture s quite nice cos it it it s a shape and it looks a bit like a bird or or whatever
1	yeah
1	but that s about as far as you go you won t think it s connected to the one at the back because why would you and so on and so on and so on
1	mm
1	erm but in fact it it s it s meant to be a piece erm about our ancestry
1	right
1	because my pause dur short mother s father s pause dur short parents or maybe they were grandparents er were moved out during the clearances in in
1	right
1	in western scotland and that was a a a a fairly tragic time and my brother went up to see if he could track down the the the cottage and eventually he could and he tracked down the graveyard and he found a tombstone and so on and so forth and he wanted to do something that related to that sort of erm er brutal time of their erm being turfed off their land and so on and so forth so when he went and he d found the the area he saw that the land now was covered in gorse and he thought mm gorse and er knowing a bit about gorse well they ve got these
1	oh i see it now
1	dried pods
1	yes yes
1	which twist when they dry out
1	yes
1	and then they explode
1	right
1	they are distributed
1	yeah
1	they they re moved and he thought well we could do something about gorse and erm he also went to a museum of agricultural implements which showed the kind of ploughs that were used in those days
1	yeah
1	which similar to trunc el trunc elsewhere as well and nothing er very specific to to scotland erm but er he he being by er training an engineer er he was interested in erm the front of the plough with the sock and the coulter
1	yes
1	erm where this represents erm i can t remember which way round it is now if that s the sock it s what turns the soil
1	yeah
1	soil over and this is the coulter
1	right
1	or it s the other way round that does the
1	right
1	actual ploughing
1	yeah
1	so the two pieces dig and turn erm and then looking at the erm at the the gorse pod itself when it twists it s a bit like that that that s the opened
1	yeah
1	the opened pod and the the seeds come up erm and this of course is gorse he took a photograph
1	yes
1	and it s quite accurate but of course he s toned down the yellow
1	yes
1	erm here is a representation of the the the what was left of the cottage which is just a pile of stones
1	yeah
1	er this indicates age because on the tombstones the trunc th trunc this is the lichen that
1	yeah
1	slowly grows out lichen that slowly grows out and this is an impression of the sock and coulter which is traditional in that part of the world that that put on the gravestones so
1	oh i see
1	so the
1	yeah
1	that s that and that is a timer like an egg timer
1	right
1	that gives the passage of time etcetera
1	right
1	etcetera etcetera and putting the two together i think it s actually a bit close but erm er it tells the story
1	yes
1	of that period of our family history well to us knowing that that s very interesting
1	yeah
1	but to other people it s you either like it or you don t
1	well
1	type of thing
1	i think it s wonderful i ve been
1	er
1	fascinated by it while you ve been talking and it s very pleasing to the eye the other thing that i would vocal desc laugh say about that because you re always for looking for more meanings in things
1	yeah yeah
1	it s got the suffragette colours in it pause dur short which er
1	interesting
1	it s got purple and lemon or yellow
1	yeah yes
1	and it has well i mean they were under suffrage weren t they and they were
1	absolutely
1	turned out and er
1	i must tell anon nametype m type name i don t know
1	yeah
1	whether he he has
1	er
1	any er
1	and the only reason i well i do know before i did know before but i went to the suffragette film recently which has
1	mm
1	been acclaimed
1	mm mm mm
1	greatly
1	mm
1	erm although my husband and i felt it was more like a drama documentary we we we did appreciate it we thought it was very good but we wouldn t say it was the best film of the year or some of the things they re
1	yeah
1	saying about it but it was good erm but yes i i was very all the ladies were wearing yellow and erm er lilac or purple
1	mm
1	flowers in their hats and
1	interesting
1	so on and so forth
1	yeah oh i must tell anon nametype m type name that he he d be very interested
1	he well he he might he might he might have known it might even have been
1	he might have known that
1	it might have even been in in is
1	he he d not mentioned it to me
1	no
1	i don t know
1	no
1	erm
1	right
1	and then fortunately it was it was too big for him so i bought it off him so
1	oh right
1	and he s got a half sized version for his house
1	but it s very nice
1	so there s more room
1	it goes beautifully in this room it s just
1	it trunc doe trunc it does
1	very nice indeed
1	yeah it does yeah
1	have you had enough shall i trunc mea trunc we call it a day
1	i m sure whoever s got to go through this stuff has trunc g trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	got more than enough vocal desc laugh
1	so vocal desc laugh i just
1	yeah quite enough yeah
1	i m just going to stop it erm
1	i don t know if anyone is going to conclude
0	like what can you do in this situation
0	i bet he doesn t even do half of it
0	yeah
0	it s just crazy
0	i don t think so right
0	police and stuff yeah
0	defend themselves against that sort of attack
0	well yeah they could do that
0	yeah
0	erm
0	look at it little shimmying along
0	it s probably laid eggs
0	vocal desc laugh great
0	come on wormy pause dur short there we go ah cute

0	oh dear
0	oh that guy s just had unclear
0	it s so hilarious
0	he s he s very satirical and that s why i like it like
0	oh the news scares me too much to even
0	oh
0	i know cos i just like up until now i haven t really even been paying attention and i feel like this may be a time to get on board with it cos i dunno
0	i was leading on from what you were just saying like i was just tagging
0	good
0	i i agree with you
0	i dunno
0	i do
0	do you oh
0	well i ve got one but i think he s not there at the moment i think he s
0	mm
0	stuff happened
0	mm
0	because how when they ve trunc ha trunc er this sounds a really ridiculous immature question but how long have isis been like a thing
0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm so maybe twenty fourteen i suppose
0	mm pause dur short well i mean they trunc prob trunc they were probably there before that but they ve
0	it really is
0	so what are jihadists then i m really confused
0	unclear
0	i i d assume jihadists are like
0	so basically they re people that murder
0	religion as
0	wow
0	jesus christ what is
0	up in the gun nest thing with like the machine guns like just sitting there like watching as they re like pause dur short children
0	yeah vocal desc cough
0	a great deal welcome the prospect of direct confrontation with the us led coalition viewing it as a harbinger of end of times showdown between trunc mus trunc muslims and their enemies described in islamic apocalyptic oh pause dur short oh like what anon nametype m type name was on about pause dur short vocal desc cough pause dur short it s scary like that s the pause dur short like they do all this propaganda stuff
0	i know
0	mm
0	this is happening in real life like
0	it s really terrifying pause dur short it s unclear
0	yeah cos it s coming out this week and it s been banned or something
0	yeah well not just this week s events
0	in general like
0	beheading no that s not
0	yeah it really is it is
0	and the way they just get their it s like samurai swords or whatever
0	mm yeah
0	it s saying here two thousand and six
0	wow pause dur short that is scary vocal desc laugh
0	not that oh i just
0	i mean up until now like their tactics like the way they ve been carrying out these terror attacks has been extremely successful you know like nobody has been caught well no they have been caught but after they ve happened like after they ve succeeded in killing a whole bunch of people
0	mm
0	gonna like repent or anything like that
0	that are gonna die
0	unclear to save more lives afterwards
0	vocal desc laugh
0	they don t deserve
0	no they can t they can t
0	mm
0	trunc tha trunc
0	and in fact they welcome conflict cos they see it as pause dur short close to the erm apocalypse er prediction that s in the
0	erm pretty much yeah
0	i dunno pause dur long
0	fuck knows
0	or you know someone significant like can you imagine
0	mm
0	if they took the royal family hostage
0	yeah
0	i mean there d be a huge uproar about that pause dur long there s no way though they could like dominate the whole country like drop bombs everywhere
0	mm
0	why not
0	er not all at once right
0	i dunno well i mean it s not getting better pause dur long
0	what does it matter
0	no it really is
0	it er inconvenience to my studies how selfish is that but just like
0	mm pause dur long got rocket launchers fucking hell
0	i know pause dur short so could they fire stuff at the uk now if they wanted to have they got enough of that kind of stuff
0	cos it s just like oh it s scary
0	but can you just imagine how easy it would be for like an isis person to go into a tube erm with like a bomb belt and detonate it on the tube like there s no security in tube stations like that
0	god that would be terrifying
0	on the train
0	there s just this turnstile and that s it
0	well nobody checks you over yeah
0	no no
0	no pause dur long
0	and they have people living here remember like they have accomplices all over the world i expect
0	how do they get their money though funded by the
0	it s that s there
0	it s just extra bit pause dur long
0	it s just pause dur short we don t nobody trunc s trunc seek we seek to destroy islam
0	yeah
0	i don t wanna bring mental illness into it cos that s not fair but just to be able to think that way and be okay with it like with just killing people pause dur short like i don t get it pause dur short i don t like religion i really don t like when it causes problems like this it s just pause dur long
0	i know pause dur long i honestly the weird thing is though i didn t think we d have a third world war in my lifetime like i didn t think it would happen because of the second world war and the first you know
0	and everyone would be absolute hysterics and it would just not be you wouldn t be able to function or anything like this like you wonder whether they re kind of holding back from saying that
0	do you think erm how many suicides er would if we were told our country was at war
0	again
0	yeah
0	basically pause dur short erm cos i think everyone has seen the uk as relatively safe up until this point
0	mm
0	mm
0	america those russia those sort of places
0	that was a long time ago but it happened once
0	the one with the
0	mm yeah
0	be the first one that got shot to be honest
0	i d just be just sort of yeah pause dur long no but we we are relatively safe in anon type place
0	and we re like near the sea and you know
0	anon type place s just kind of like you unclear live anywhere unclear vocal desc laugh
0	like it s highly unlikely
0	here we are how many years later and the world s not collapsed even though things are pretty bad like we ve not
0	mm i think oh i dunno like how would we control it we d get people with guns and shit but that s
0	yeah i do wonder though
0	what friday the thirteenth
0	mm could be pause dur long oh god sickening like it s not difficult for them to gain followers
0	why
0	yeah

0	yeah she just was never interested and always used to say to anon nametype m type name like why does anon nametype m type name hate me and just making it so difficult like unclear
0	or just laugh about it do you know what i mean
0	god pause dur short so that s all all really awkward pause dur short vocal desc sigh then there s the vocal desc laugh there s anon nametype m type name s girlfriend i ve not i don t know anything really about her i m sure she d be very nice but i keep wanting to call her pause dur short oh god what s her name so i think her name s anon nametype f type name the ex girlfriend was called anon nametype f type name and i really keep wanting to call her anon nametype f type name

0	don t like anon nametype m type name but unclear he throws a good unclear party
0	and anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name was there
0	she s annoying in general she s an annoying person
0	no but it s just like i m not rude to her i just can t be bothered to be fake with her mm
0	become a recluse
0	no pause dur short sometimes it s just nice to have time on your own though
0	vocal desc yawn i m so tired but pause dur short i don t wanna go to sleep unclear unclear a little unclear nap unclear need unclear a cup of tea need a cup of tea
0	unclear didn t say anything so vocal desc laugh
0	unclear oh unclear
0	unclear i have unclear a message
1	erm two recordings at the moment i ve on my phone this is not very handy my phone because the technology of a smart phone
1	yes
1	is not particularly compatible with the
1	what the equipment they use
1	with the mp and the other
1	oh
1	sort of software that you have
1	yes
1	to record music and stuff like that because erm they re you know they re all apple people
1	yes
1	those people they like apple better
1	oh
1	they don t like all the
1	oh
1	microsofts and the unclear etcetera
1	yes
1	but erm so the idea is just that we kind of chat away
1	yeah right fine no problem
1	so erm erm probably erm so erm you it s your your daughter that you went out to see when they she had her babies wasn t it you were going out to see
1	yes
1	to see babies
1	yes
1	so
1	yes that s right yes she erm had her first baby er exactly vocal desc laugh just almost to the day that they had to leave berlin and then and move into the house in brussels and er er we went over anon nametype f type name had to come over to london to have the child erm in the typically erm i suppose it s a reprehensible way i put my foot down and said my grandson is going to be born in this country
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i m not having any kraut vocal desc laugh grandchildren thank you and er so she came over here and gave birth erm er in anon type place
1	uhu
1	erm well what s it called er it was anon type place
1	oh i don t know actually
1	it was well it s anon type place or anon type place
1	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah erm
1	so i don t know how that works though because my my nephew was born in bahrain and erm and i was never sure whether that meant that there was some kind of question mark over his i mean both his parents are british but
1	if
1	you know if you re born overseas i don t know where that leaves you whether there s the kind of there s just that little trace there in your heritage where people say
1	you you you you
1	oh you know
1	you ll have to be careful you will have to make sure that the er er british authorities know when it happened
1	mm
1	and so you have to tell the local consul
1	right
1	and so on unless they ve changed it or unless the the rules in the european union may be different but it was essential that er trunc th trunc those two little children were born in england
1	oh right
1	so that they could trunc ha trunc trunc ha trunc where there wouldn t be any problem about them trunc beco trunc them becoming british subjects
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	well i was yes i was slightly concerned with my sister as i thought you know actually erm you do find that people who are born and spend their early lives with their peripatetic parents sometimes don t develop roots
1	anon nametype m type name
1	you know
1	my second son anon nametype m type name was born in paris his mother is french and erm she then she s quite a clued up lady erm she moved from paris and worked for one of the er trunc dep trunc department authorities in southwest france
1	mm
1	and that s where anon nametype m type name first went to school then he came back to england and when he came back to england erm i had to er register him and take out british nationality for him and it i even trunc h trunc even had to go to the lengths of getting a copy of the his french birth certificate with my name on it
1	oh really
1	yes vocal desc laugh they may have changed all that this was in nineteen erm eight nineteen the nineteen eighties
1	mm
1	erm
1	i wouldn t have thought it was easier now i would have thought it was more difficult now because there are so many
1	trunc ye trunc i think it is more difficult
1	i mean and we are actually getting worse
1	yes
1	about even europeans coming here aren t we
1	yes yes vocal desc laugh
1	don t know where all that s going to end i mean i know my mother when she first came to the country had to go to the police station every week and register
1	where where had she come from
1	well she s french
1	oh she s french is she
1	mm
1	from which part of france
1	well she was born in toulouse
1	oh right down there
1	yeah
1	at one part anon nametype m type name went to anon type place or whatever it s called
1	uhu
1	in in in anon type place and because of er the anon type place work
1	yeah
1	and they they put a lot of money into all the educational facilities and he got an internship with anon type place
1	mm
1	and from anon type place he got himself a place at one of the london university colleges er it s a bit stupid i can t remember whether it s anon type place or something like that but
1	uhu
1	erm and he went to a london university but it was quite a business and while he was at the london university the i had to deal with the business of his citizenship
1	mm
1	but only when he was i dunno he must have been er seventeen or eighteen yeah
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	whereas the french i was talking to my mother about this the other day you know i could get a french passport if i wanted one and erm and my siblings have done so erm but they all reported how snotty the people were at the vocal desc laugh french embassy when you went there vocal desc laugh
1	oh that s that s true
1	so her
1	mm mm
1	and they were all sort of very disdainful and looked down their nose at you
1	yeah yeah
1	and like
1	mm mm
1	can i help you what are you doing here
1	mm mm mm
1	so i ve always sort of put off the business of going to to get a french passport as well but there were various times when erm unclear for example wrote to me and asked me if i d like to vote
1	vocal desc laugh
1	well i unclear vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	er because erm obviously he felt that it would help his cause i suppose
1	yeah
1	rather than his opponents
1	yeah
1	so but i think they seem to have a very different attitude to to us have you got property in france
1	no no no no i m glad erm i wouldn t want to have either
1	no
1	i i wouldn t want to live in france it s a nightmare country
1	do you think so
1	it s er oh gosh it s awful
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know no er i mean the only sensible thing that any french people do is come over over here why do you think there are so many people french over here
1	well i don t know i mean
1	well the trunc rea trunc i ll tell you exactly why if you ve got any initiative at all er er you want to set up your own business for example
1	mm
1	or you go into a big firm like erm er thomson csf which is the biggest armaments trunc com trunc company erm and erm pause dur short you get very well trained up you trunc ha trunc they insist on you having all these qualifications and so on half of which you don t need
1	uhu
1	erm and unless you have them you can t get a job
1	no
1	erm and then if you want to set up your own because you can see all the the er on cost of the bureaucracy which these large firms are stuck with the minute you set up a company you have to pay tax whether you ve made a profit or not it stifles all initiative it s quite extraordinary
1	yeah
1	and i ll tell you another thing if you have and this is from past experience if you have a house or a share in a house and you want to share that house you have to do it through a a er an agent appointed appointed not chosen by you appointed by the state
1	mm
1	and he acts as a a erm a mediator and whoever is buying the you know er property has to use that person as well
1	gosh
1	and so if you erm say well you you think the man is getting it all wrong er firing the guy is well a very expensive job in in fact
1	mm
1	it it their system of doing things is is weird
1	they do have very
1	mm
1	very strong protectionism my mother
1	oh yes that s unclear it s beyond belief unclear
1	my mother inherited her mother s house and
1	mm
1	erm
1	unclear
1	she was obviously very trunc senti trunc sentimental about it and wanted to keep it but that trunc wa trunc this was in a suburb of bordeaux
1	mm
1	so it wasn t it just wasn t feasible as a holiday house and er so she let it out and you re not allowed to evict any tenants between november and april because you re not allowed to evict tenants during the winter because of the potential hardship of the tenant
1	oh
1	so even if they re not paying you rent you re not allowed to evict them
1	that is barmy vocal desc laugh
1	erm it all went so horribly horribly wrong over the years that and she got fleeced terribly by this this one man erm who really sort of took liberties and then when she came to sell it she had that same situation where you have the
1	uhu
1	the person who brokers the sale
1	yes
1	and the only saving grace of it is that in order to avoid death duties and capital gains and stuff like they re they the the appointed agent will at some point or another leave the room whereupon packages of money are exchanged under the table vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	between the vocal desc laugh buyer and the seller because you have an official selling price
1	mm
1	which is sort of set a price where you know which is quite an innocuous sort of price
1	yes
1	that doesn t attract any attention from the authorities
1	unclear
1	and then there s the real sales price
1	mm mm
1	which is negotiated privately on the side
1	mm
1	so you know you have pieces of paper on the table
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that says the house is being sold for x and then an envelope with
1	yes
1	the balance of the money gets passed underneath the table while the guy is is is looking in the other direction erm so erm so the french have found a way around the bureaucracy
1	vocal desc laugh
1	in fact i think really but but that s not to say that erm the state is not a bit erm oppressive in that trunc re trunc in that regard i suppose that s one of the reasons why they don t have the same problems in paris that they do over here with this sort of young people trying to find rented accommodation because you you know there is not that property ownership thing there not a fetishistic thing
1	yeah
1	about property ownership
1	yeah it s true
1	there
1	all and er all the land and i know that that but unclear all the land in paris belongs to the state
1	mm
1	it doesn t belong to various individuals
1	mm
1	my aunt had a house er in er erm er unclear montan unclear i trunc can trunc unclear montan unclear and my great aunt also had a house down there as well erm and they were always having trouble with er getting permission to do this or having this that and the other done
1	mm
1	and so on and you have to oil everybody s hands and
1	yeah
1	otherwise you just never get anywhere er
1	no pause dur short it is erm no my father was though is always that he wants to move there because erm they don t have oh well until recently they haven t had the same thing about speeding pause dur short so you could drive how you wanted and however fast you wanted
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	and you were okay and also you know he felt that erm oh he had a thing about david blunkett introducing all these laws about gun owning guns and things like that vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	so
1	vocal desc laugh
1	he just trunc tha trunc the french are the french are more grown up and reasonable about about erm you know erm pause dur short not erm infantalising i suppose people or
1	mm
1	seeking to be very parental about about how they live their lives and what they have and what they do and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and so on but i don t i think the french are catching up with us in that regard actually
1	their inheritance laws are are bizarre
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short you can t make a will in a way that you can here
1	no
1	i think is ridiculous
1	no cos you can t it things get inherited by your children don t they not by your spouse
1	er that s correct and and also you can t erm er just er er write a will saying i leave all my property to a cats home
1	no
1	or i leave all my property to my second son
1	yeah
1	not my first son and it doesn t matter if you put in the fact that you trunc s trunc first son has made a million anything like that oh no the law has to operate
1	yeah
1	your
1	so it s a feudal then really isn t it or sort of
1	well it s dictatorial and it s a totalitarian is sort of
1	yeah
1	er however you wanna call it
1	yeah
1	er
1	but i suppose it s about you know perhaps it s about land perhaps it s about you know the family farm going down through the generations or something
1	mm i think er er er er i think it s a erm an intellectual approach i would say rather crudely that all french people suffer from the trunc pr trunc what i call the promised land syndrome
1	oh yeah vocal desc laugh
1	er if you they all quote rousseau at you
1	uhu
1	erm about every man is free and all that sort of nonsense and erm pause dur short er they entirely trunc o trunc they had this vision that they all had this vision of a perfect state where everybody is properly looked after and as some people here say everybody has a prize
1	mm
1	and so on they don t stop to think about the practicalities of it and the result of that is that they re for example their er farming agricultural industry is chronically inefficient
1	mm
1	because none of the units are the right size
1	uhu
1	er they don t once you build up a a or you reach a what i think you call a critical mass on the farm for example you get the right amount of machinery and get it pause dur short erm capitalised properly used properly so that it was worth spending money for example on a a forty thousand pound combine harvester and there s no point in having a piece of machinery like that if you ve only got twenty acres
1	mm
1	but it once you get to the right level of saying five hundred acres or might probably be a thousand acres in fact erm er then when you die they will say oh no that s all got to be split up again and so they they re constantly destroying the trunc ec trunc economic base of their agriculture
1	mm
1	it s weird
1	that is very weird isn t it
1	it is yeah
1	gosh i suppose they ve got a lot of land though haven t they perhaps er perhaps they re not they haven t got the same sort of the the panic about it that we do cos we re always sort of saying oh we re running out we re running out of land there s not enough room whereas france is very spread out and sometimes actually
1	it is yes
1	you look at the way the french sort of set things out and you think pause dur short you re being very careless actually with your
1	oh that s that s
1	with your countryside
1	it s funny that you say that because erm french people coming over here erm we ve er taken erm er trunc peo trunc like anon nametype f type name and her sister and so on down to anon type place and the thing that they always say is oh the countryside in england is manicured
1	mm
1	er er which i find weird actually because when you drive around er the suburbs of paris where there are gardens or in normandy where there are good farms they look after them
1	yeah
1	beautifully
1	yeah
1	because they have this sense of style vocal desc laugh or
1	yeah
1	unclear whatever it is unclear and everything has to be very presentable
1	yeah
1	erm
1	well even in the middle where there s very little and very few people
1	yes
1	when you drive across it s all
1	yes
1	it s all you know you it s not like being in america where you ve got the badlands or wild quite wild country
1	yeah
1	that s not obvious that it belongs to anybody it s all terribly cultivated
1	vocal desc laugh
1	how strange pause dur short gosh
1	i m sure you read about the guy who was not allowed to run a ski school
1	no vocal desc laugh no
1	anon nametype m type name erm his his mother erm finished up looking after one of the departments in the in the pyrenees
1	uhu
1	and as a result of that he got the opportunity to ski right through i think two or three winters and got himself qualified as a ski instructor
1	uhu
1	but they trunc wo trunc won t allow anon nametype m type name for example is just as good if not better skier but he s not allowed to instruct at all
1	because
1	because has hasn t gone through the rigmarole of taking all these exams
1	oh
1	and erm this that and the other and so on
1	mm
1	it s just childish really
1	well i don t know i i often think the french are fifty percent of them are bureaucrats and the other half are anarchists
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes that s just about true yes
1	and they kind of hold each other in a state of
1	vocal desc laugh yes unclear yes
1	vocal desc laugh unclear status unclear
1	yeah yeah
1	my mother s definitely on er on the anarchic side actually
1	vocal desc laugh
1	she s she went to some you know if you have the misfortune to go into a courtroom with her or something and you stand up when the judge comes in my mother s sitting there starting to go i don t see why i should have to stand up for him he s only a human being like the rest of us
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	er at one point erm i m i i i had a heart attack and erm i thought while i while i was recovering i couldn t work i will erm er er brush up my german so i went to anon type place college
1	uhu
1	and er in and er it it it s a i think it s a a college of further education or whatever they call it anyway
1	mm
1	er it s very the language language department is very well run the head of the language department is a french lady
1	mm
1	and her sister she introduced me to her sister her sister is the most joyous individual she is one of the anarchists
1	uhu
1	and you know erm in i think it was in nicaragua
1	uhu
1	erm or one of those central american erm countries they what do they call the trunc com trunc trunc c trunc can you remember what they were called
1	oh
1	contra something or other
1	yes yes yes yeah
1	mm anyway somehow she got herself into a position of editing the a book by one of these i wish i could remember what they re called erm they re trunc r trunc trunc r trunc trunc r trunc rebels against the americans at any rate
1	yeah
1	erm and er i got to know her quite well and she certainly had anarchist tendencies and on one occasion the book was being published in paris and so
1	mm
1	she er was going backwards and forwards and er she was doing a job i think also i dunno if it was in anon type place college but it was something to do with education anyway erm and er she went over to paris and she came back absolutely knackered and i said
1	vocal desc laugh
1	manif foreign on the champs elysees what would be what she meant was there was a demonstration
1	uhu vocal desc laugh
1	erm about something or other which something had done i said what was it all about it took me about two hours to discover that she really hadn t a clue what the demonstration was about
1	vocal desc laugh but she joined in
1	she joined in because it was a good party
1	vocal desc laugh
1	literally literally
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh it s the most extraordinary performance to be fair at the end of it all she gave me a signed copy of the book which had been published vocal desc laugh
1	uhu
1	which was rather fun and it was all about smuggling things like bicycles
1	smuggling bicycles okay
1	yes
1	uhu vocal desc laugh
1	now into central america well i always thought central america was er you know straight up and down no unclear flatlands unclear at all but
1	oh
1	the thought of bicycling around nicaragua oh i wish i could remember what they were called trunc th trunc these people
1	oh no i my brain has gone as well now
1	but but the the sort of villain of the piece was a man called noriega i think
1	yeah pause dur short that sounds familiar
1	confindustria er confindustria for the italian erm cpi not that pause dur short contra something or other
1	mm
1	anyway
1	mm
1	it was quite a interesting experience
1	mm
1	er but i ve got to know quite a lot of french people and really quite well and
1	you seem to have a constant stream of french people actually
1	we do yes because they like coming over here
1	mm
1	they live in primark getting our our
1	oh i know well the little girls we have at the unclear brics unclear who are all
1	yes
1	all from this school in bordeaux
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	and we have a link with a school in bordeaux because when i was growing up erm there was a young woman called anon nametype f type name who used to come over in the holidays and look after us
1	yeah
1	and er she had a student she then went on to be a student and and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	this trunc stu trunc one of her students said to her i need a placement in england so trunc sh trunc anon nametype f type name phoned me up and said could you take a student and then since then we ve been taking two a year so we have vocal desc laugh we had this sort of anon nametype m type name who s a fellow trustee said erm oh yes i ve just been looking at the people who have been visiting our website and looking at the statistics and strangely we seem to have a lot of people in bordeaux looking at our website
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh so i said yes it s all the students that go to a particular school researching us
1	oh right
1	before they write to us and say can i come over and do two months placement with you so erm so we have this ongoing link with erm with the students in bordeaux but they all come over here and erm they re very naive really about what to expect when they get to london and some of them have the most horrible adventures with
1	oh lord vocal desc laugh
1	rental properties and unscrupulous
1	oh lord yes
1	types and whatever
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	so and they re cos they re always trying to economise by finding you know finding flats on the internet and you can t tell them that london s a big place and it s full of strangers and that that actually you can t trust anybody you meet on the internet and there s one girl
1	yes yeah
1	in particular who got awfully stung and erm and er somebody took about two thousand euros off her in advance
1	oh dear
1	er rental on a flat and turned out to be
1	god
1	a complete fake and the flat didn t exist and
1	oh heavens
1	i know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so they do they do actually fall er get themselves into trouble from time to time
1	yeah i spent a day bordeaux is a rather a nice place actually i think
1	oh i hate it
1	oh do you oh i
1	yeah
1	had very happy times there er when i was working in anon type place cathedral they sent me to france to find out how they look after the cathedrals there
1	oh yeah
1	and er i was the the
1	they have a splendid cathedral
1	er bordeaux erm and the reason i was sent to bordeaux was because it was english for such a very long time and they were actually keen to find out the the clerk of the works and his erm people in anon type place were keen to find out whether er trunc anybo trunc there d been any exchange of er craftsmen and technology between
1	oh
1	the british colony in bordeaux
1	yeah
1	and the er trunc chi trunc two particular cathedrals chichester and and erm salisbury
1	oh gosh
1	i don t know if you ve have you been to chichester the the the point
1	mm no
1	but it s it s as the cathedral is very interesting vocal desc laugh one one of the most quirky and interesting things about it is that a man was in the nave with a box original box camera in eighteen sixty something when the spire imploded
1	vocal desc gasp
1	and he er he managed to take photographs of it actually happening
1	oh my god
1	er and and they re really primitive pictures but you can see it s most interesting things because you can see that once the er pause dur short the inner cement so to speak mortar mortar started to crumble the weight er you it it went like that er right down
1	like a sodden pudding
1	yes
1	or something yeah
1	yes er
1	oh
1	yes really strange and the other thing that
1	i had no idea that had happened
1	erm the you can and well if you go there you will see the photographs
1	wow
1	at a tourist attraction
1	wow
1	and the other thing about er er chichester is that there is still to this day erm they have a a a proper international stone yard er an awful lot of er churches in the south of england use quoin stone
1	oh do they oh
1	yes uhu er and if for example peterborough which is miles up er erm that s got
1	yeah no
1	a lot of french stone
1	yes absolutely i suppose
1	yes
1	it s quite near the eastern coast if
1	oh yes it was
1	unclear
1	it would go up the river nene in a
1	yeah
1	in a barge
1	so perhaps it was that so you sort of went up that side of the country to get to
1	any rate i i went er with the direct er directed by the clerk of the works in salisbury erm to the people in chichester and then i was sent off to bordeaux to see whether there was any
1	yeah
1	any link
1	and was there
1	there is of craftsmen erm it s quite limited
1	uhu
1	erm there s no what i call vocal desc laugh what they quite heavy lifting erm they didn t er pick up any erm constructive technology from er bordeaux
1	mm
1	no all of that came from trunc mm trunc er particularly from the abbey at st denis
1	uhu
1	actually erm and to canterbury and so on
1	oh right
1	erm
1	but craftsmen individual craftsmen were going
1	individual craftsmen who would go and do for example trunc th trunc that they you must have seen bosses the stone bosses
1	mm
1	which are beautifully carved and and some there was an interchange between craftsmen from france coming through england
1	yeah
1	and vice versa
1	yeah
1	but erm otherwise no not
1	oh right yes
1	nobody er nobody knows quite who was the engineering brain behind salisbury cathedral because it it it s it is an engineering feat
1	yeah
1	there
1	well then er they are just when you look at them and think about what the must have been involved in conceiving them and building them then i mean well it must have taken well it did take decades in some instances didn t it to put them up there s that wonderful erm william golding novel called the spire
1	oh yes that s right that s right absolutely you know
1	and i think it s an absolutely fantastic book
1	mm vocal desc laugh
1	a man of a man obsessed really pause dur short yes we we managed to find something about the architecture of erm anon type place for erm pause dur short erm anon nametype m type name s son anon nametype m type name was helping us out a bit
1	mm
1	and he did a bit of digging around and found out a bit more about our architect and it was the only the only building he ever trunc l trunc led on so he was part of architectural team with erm william tite or something who was quite a famous architect of the time
1	yes
1	but he he only ever sort of led on one building which was our building
1	really
1	but erm but you know he was erm he he got quite good press for it really in those days
1	mm
1	er but
1	but there was a street named after him
1	yes the one opposite
1	what was it called
1	anon type place road yeah
1	anon type place
1	yeah
1	is it anon type place yes
1	yeah
1	er yes
1	so
1	but i ve never found a i ve never heard of any come across any other building that s put up by him
1	no
1	i suppose that s right
1	no he was
1	er
1	there were some there were other churches he worked on as part of a team for a boss but anon type place is his only his only trunc s trunc sole creation really
1	yeah oh
1	so so that s it that was fun that was quite fun to find that out actually so we we this this open day thing was quite good for us it was it was
1	i d noticed you d put some lovely erm prints or drawings up as you go in at the bottom of the lift
1	yeah yes
1	that s rather fascinating
1	yeah
1	or trunc pho trunc photographs of
1	no that s my little photographic expedition vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	all these photographs from the anon type place archives
1	yeah
1	there s quite a that quite an amazing of the spire of anon type place across the fields because it was there
1	oh yes yeah
1	before all the houses came so
1	yes yeah
1	so it s sort of standing on its own in the middle of an orchard or something
1	vocal desc laugh
1	which is hard to imagine these days pause dur short with er all that traffic rushing past us
1	do you still have an annual art exhibition
1	we do
1	yeah
1	we do
1	great
1	so and actually anon nametype m type name who is the art teacher is now
1	yes
1	now running classes on our building as well so so that s trunc actua trunc so i m hoping that we re going to reposition ourselves and be a bit more artistic have a few more kind of
1	oh that s good
1	kind of of that sort of class going on
1	yes
1	where people pay for it apparently erm
1	there ll be er er on the twenty ninth there ll be a girl erm there called anon nametype f type name
1	uhu
1	i ll introduce you to her she works for anon type place
1	oh yeah
1	erm
1	oh
1	and erm well you might find it quite a useful link i don t know
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	er because they ve got a lot er er a large educational programme
1	yeah
1	trunc w trunc on trunc r trunc
1	i think you were trying you there was somebody before wasn t there
1	yes there was yes there was
1	i mean years ago and didn t come off for some reason
1	mm
1	i can t remember what that was the
1	oh i think the reason it came trunc o trunc didn t come off was cos i think i got ill
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	erm erm and i had to postpone meetings i ve i ve i ve er do remember that actually
1	mm
1	and unclear that s what happened
1	i think there might trunc ha trunc it was also there was something else as well i don t trunc remem trunc i think there was can t remember what the problem
1	i certainly arranged for somebody from the anon type place to talk to anon nametype m type name actually
1	yes
1	that i know that that did come off erm
1	oh i think but i think it might have been one of those things where there was one conversation and then one person said that i need to pass you on to another person and then as so often happens
1	yes
1	that s where it never quite
1	oh it
1	actually kind of comes about
1	yes yes
1	despite good intentions on both sides and i i think
1	yeah
1	the timing the timing cos of the timing of the art competition or something it didn t work out i can t remember but erm pause dur short no it s been it s been erm no we still do it and we still have our little french students helping us out it s a way of kind of marketing without marketing really
1	well yeah mm
1	but as the open day was a way of marketing
1	mm
1	cos that i think you know it has limited i don t know how we ve we market ourselves i think the best way is to have people in the hall and saying you know oh what a lovely hall i think i might come back here
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh so so we re having all kinds of difficulties with er with er with the congregation again of course vocal desc laugh
1	oh dear pause dur short in what way
1	well we were having an argument er there was the most surreal argument at the agm about the bollards pause dur short because there was
1	outside the west end
1	yes
1	mm
1	because there were there was a few instants where the people who run the nightclub opposite were just taking over the car park at night and there were a couple of er attacks stabbings
1	oh lord
1	where the perpetrators were loitering in our car park and jumping out on people in anon type place and
1	oh
1	stabbing them
1	dear
1	and then jumping in the car and rushing off and there was also lots of drug dealing so we decided that that we were going to lock the bollards so we had a rather surreal conversation where we had a delegation from the church demanding that they be allowed to have a bollard please so given that we were reporting on the fact that our finances were up the creek at the time
1	mm
1	and then they turned up and said yeah but yeah but can please can we have a bollard please vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so as usual a completely disproportionate response to er
1	vocal desc cough
1	so anyway so you ve begun to when you retired you were going to sort of help the the the association round here but did you did your estate here get taken over in the end by an anon type place or a whatever it was
1	trunc ye trunc yes what happened er was that er the council erm they er wanted to get rid of responsibility for all their freehold on what was originally the anon type place estate
1	uhu
1	and erm
1	i presume this was enough to unclear win a unclear bombsite or something
1	trunc abso trunc absolutely
1	or did they knock it down trunc del trunc deliberately
1	no no
1	they didn t knock it down deliberately
1	no no no it was it was it was
1	thank goodness for that
1	trunc fla trunc flattened and er well what er what then happened was that er the tenants and residents association erm put together a a a trunc sh trunc i think they called it a shadow regeneration board
1	mm
1	erm and i er er they erm er selected the they interviewed and trunc s trunc er and then selected a er housing association anon type place housing trunc ass trunc anon type place housing trust erm and at that point erm it this er there was a meeting of the tenants and residents association and a presentation was made by somebody from this shadow board and i started asking questions and erm i was asked to join the board
1	uhu
1	and er er we were responsible for er putting together a package er which covered all the functions which er had been discharged by the council
1	right
1	to service their tenants on this estate and that was er the the terms the legislation which provides for the transfer away from the council to a recognised housing
1	mm
1	association and that has to be voted on
1	yeah
1	and there was a pause dur short a a a ballot er based on the proposals which the this shadow board had agreed erm and everybody mm by an an a marginal majority i don t think it was about trunc th trunc twenty votes so to speak i trunc d trunc two hundred and something erm they decided against it
1	oh
1	erm but yours
1	gosh
1	yours truly being i was rather surprised from talking to people because i thought it would be passed on a nod almost
1	yeah
1	i discovered that that the ballot had been rigged
1	vocal desc gasp
1	and that people had been going round erm er er er er saying er trunc ca trunc to people who in in the two unclear wings that are sheltered unclear that s all sheltered housing
1	oh right yeah
1	at the far far end knocking on the doors and say oh give us your erm er er voting er card and we ll put it in the ballot ballot box and erm
1	oh no
1	they d they d either been telling people how to vote or they d just not been putting the er papers in the ballot box
1	oh no
1	and the the the truth of it was that the electoral that the ballot was carried out by the i think it s called the electoral reform society
1	it is yeah that s our
1	and they had been so slovenly er they they should
1	had they really they should
1	oh yes
1	they re supposed to be the people who are the example of how to do this
1	they were not they were just lazy
1	really
1	idle and so we erm trunc w trunc we we had to go to get anon nametype f type name to approach the minister of state who is a good lady called anon nametype f type name
1	uhu
1	erm and er with anon nametype f type name s help erm yours truly wrote to anon nametype f type name and said can we please have a revamp and that was the agreed the trunc gov trunc the department of the environment i think it was called
1	mm
1	ministry of housing erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they said yes and erm the second time round the offer made by erm metropolitan
1	mm
1	was accepted
1	oh right okay
1	and then erm the offer was based on metropolitan spending twenty four million pounds
1	yeah
1	on the regeneration of the estate
1	mm
1	erm and er er the the board the shadow board was er er given permanent er status so to speak and er it it had to allow for a a rotation in membership
1	mm
1	and i er volunteered to stand down erm after the first i think it was two years erm and er pause dur short it it had erm mm we had approved the initial essential work programme
1	mm
1	the sort of urgent repairs that needed doing and then i stood down but just before i stood down er they came up they discovered there was er asbestos all over the place
1	oh no
1	yeah and erm trunc th trunc they the health and safety people moved in
1	oh
1	and said you ve got to take all this asbestos out and it was blue or brown or pink or i don t know what what it was and er
1	the harmful kind
1	trunc y trunc yeah it was the harmful sort yeah
1	oh no
1	erm and er er we were told that we if we had this could have it done for free
1	yeah
1	erm and i said well that s fine but i trunc w trunc i want want a contract and so on and i said no can t do things for free that it s not like they could do things
1	mm
1	and the anon type place was so slovenly and just generally uncooperative because they also at the same time erm were proposing to redo redo the rooves
1	yeah
1	er of the houses er which had got asbestos in them and so we trunc sai trunc which er which was freehold which we all said well if you re going to do redo this those er rooves can t you do our rooves as well they said oh no they said no and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	one way or another i just got and we all got completely fed up
1	oh
1	with anon type place i m not quite sure where the problem lay but at at a higher level in the local anon type place people because all the anon type place people we d originally been dealing with they suddenly they all resigned pause dur short they vanished and we got a lot of people trying to run this replacement of the they are called fascia boards where the asbestos was er of trunc cour trunc didn t know their way round the estate they were er
1	oh how unclear
1	er i think it it was very unsatisfactory the whole thing and er they d been erm i m out of it now but i i just got completely browned off
1	no i m not surprised really
1	er er it was really tiresome
1	not surprised and i think some of these trunc ass trunc that some of these housing associations claim they overreach themselves and
1	yes
1	got out of their depth
1	yes
1	with all this stuff
1	well they ve got very weak management
1	mm
1	and they don t pay attention to details they they trunc s trunc sent us round at the end of the trunc repl trunc the replacing of the fascia boards they gave us all erm a a letter er saying this is what we ve done and it it it literally did not make sense it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and so we had had to you know er er we get anon type place to issue new letters and then erm it s in in the case of our house erm and it said that they had replaced the vent axia erm the extractor fan they hadn t
1	no
1	and er er and in one of the houses
1	vocal desc misc
1	two two or three down that way erm fortunately er the the freeholder erm er noticed the work was being done when she was not aware it was about to be done and she she d found that the guy who was doing the work had muddled up the numbers
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and he was doing work which should have been for
1	oh
1	number eighty four
1	yes
1	on number eighty three and number eighty four you know when you come up the street and the houses
1	yes
1	on that side are completely different
1	yes
1	there s a small dock which belonged to the council
1	yeah
1	that s number eighty four and they re
1	oh
1	early victorian houses and he
1	vocal desc misc
1	should have been doing a job on that on the house over there
1	yes
1	and he was doing trying to do that sort of just didn t work at all
1	no
1	er
1	i remember once getting a free boiler service like that
1	mm
1	when somebody was supposed to be at somebody else s house but it s not very satisfactory is it really that s bizarre isn t it so erm have you lived here since it was new
1	since what
1	since this this was new this house
1	no no the the houses were built in nineteen sixty seven
1	uhu
1	and er erm they were privatised by wait a minute trunc n trunc that s not no nineteen seventy six that s
1	mm
1	trunc ni trunc seventy six and then mrs thatcher introduced the er sale of council houses and er er about er i think it s actually over fifty percent of the houses here trunc w trunc have been privatised
1	oh right
1	yeah and this house was erm the tenant was a builder erm and he made various changes erm including disconnecting the house from the communal heating
1	oh vocal desc laugh that s vocal desc laugh
1	erm which in fact was a erm a a really sensible thing to do
1	uhu
1	trunc bu trunc but it meant that we had extraordinary pipework erm sticking up into the kitchen this wall was about where you are now
1	oh right
1	where you and i are now and there there was a a curious pipe connection sticking up into the middle of the kitchen it was really very very odd indeed
1	oh
1	but the trunc disconnect trunc the the discontinuance of the communal heating system was one of the erm jobs which er anon type place was supposed to do erm and er they trunc m trunc made a horlicks of that too they didn t realise that half of the estate is erm on the front level unclear
1	oh oh really
1	and where that is the case the erm the houses are built in pairs in fact
1	mm
1	and underneath that wall and not under this this wall but under the next wall erm there was a a er like a er a solid wall
1	uhu
1	so that no water can pass through one to the other
1	oh right
1	and
1	okay
1	erm just pipes and that s all and then the the wall here is is it isn t any longer but it was relatively it had a big hole in it in fact
1	mm mm
1	erm and there is a tunnel which you can er go through er which was built originally erm as a er er like a a test unclear it s for it s you need to find out where the heating could go trunc wh trunc where
1	vocal desc laugh
1	where there were other pipes and so on
1	yeah
1	but when they when anon type place discontinued the communal heating they didn t realise that er these walls must be replaced otherwise if there was a a the i think it s called the anon type place river
1	oh the anon type place right it s here as well is it
1	and if if there s if there s a very high tide
1	yeah
1	the water backs up
1	yeah
1	and the the erm
1	vocal desc gasp
1	the the these er chambers cos they re they re not really like cellars you can t get into them
1	no
1	trunc o trunc other than by going through a manhole
1	right gosh
1	erm pause dur short any rate pause dur short erm it was just another area where anon type place were were being really stupid and another thing they did
1	vocal desc sigh
1	which infuriated trunc for trunc fortunately we weren t involved erm they were charging people for erm electric light and heating hot water and heating
1	yeah
1	erm who who erm were not getting any
1	vocal desc laugh
1	er it s quite extraordinary and er
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they they let us know that they were going to disconnect the communal aerial there s a communal erm er a television aerial on the top of anon type place
1	oh yeah yeah
1	erm and er trunc w trunc trunc w trunc we erm were sent a note saying this was going to be disconnected and we didn t think we trunc w trunc we were on it and so we asked them to check and they said oh no you re not on it and then there was a long pause and then about six months later erm our er television suddenly stopped working and we found vocal desc laugh that they they d when
1	vocal desc laugh
1	whether we were connected to it or not i don t really know but anyway they d cut through some wires when they were disconnected that
1	yeah
1	and cut through our television
1	oh
1	aerial wire
1	no
1	so we we sort of oh enough is a enough and we bought a a a saucer
1	yeah
1	and a lot of other people have similar bought saucers
1	yeah
1	but that s where anon type place have been very unsatisfactory they pay no attention to detail at all
1	no that s every exasperating isn t it
1	yes
1	very exasperating i mean are they they must be they sounds as if they re more exasperating than anon type place in fact which
1	well by quite honestly they are actually because at least anon type place clean the streets
1	yes
1	and they also erm er trunc o trunc offered us and gave us a quarterly test inspection
1	oh yeah
1	so and the trunc infesta trunc we had cockroaches or er whatever erm every quarter we could be certain that they would be extinguished or eradicated or
1	yeah
1	you know
1	that makes sense to do it
1	and they
1	in advance doesn t it rather than
1	yes it does
1	wait till they ve
1	trunc ab trunc absolutely
1	especially with these modern builds where they ve got
1	yeah
1	voids and passages and things
1	yeah they
1	through the brickwork that you
1	yeah
1	they pop up everywhere but
1	yeah
1	have no idea
1	vocal desc laugh so our experience with anon type place has not been very happy i m afraid
1	oh no that s
1	yeah
1	that s sad really oh dear
1	then erm there were er two councillors that were er on the anon type place the the it s called anon type place regeneration board and i got to know them one of them quite well one of them was a liberal chap and i dunno what happened he lost his seat or something and the other one was a a labour chap and he stayed on and i got to know him quite well and he was quite a conscious councillor dealing with local issues and so on
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh he wrote to me and said would i sponsor him in the last round of local elections
1	mm
1	and i i said i just wrote back and said no way er vocal desc laugh he asked why and i said well vocal desc laugh a man who vocal desc laugh says that he s going to cap energy prices must be mad
1	oh right vocal desc laugh
1	and said oh why i didn t know he was going to i it was it was the most trunc sh trunc awful experience with this guy who was
1	oh
1	you know er standing as a labour councillor hadn t a clue what the labour
1	oh right
1	their policies were
1	mm oh well
1	anyway there you go
1	oh
1	mm
1	i see
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh so oh it s a bit sad about the writing did you finish that book that you were working on when you were
1	i ve got up to i ve got up to sixteen forty eight
1	right and how many how many vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	how much more have you got to go
1	er i m erm er er er it goes up to nineteen eighteen
1	right
1	and i actually have read up up to nineteen eighteen
1	mm
1	and it s just a question of sorting myself out and sitting down and and putting something down on paper but
1	yeah
1	it takes quite a long time to do that and it i did too lame and too lazy to go what you have to do is to go every day to the british library and
1	and unclear do it
1	er because to make a a book worth reading you have to contribute some sort of original view on subjects
1	mm
1	and erm pause dur short the i suppose er just at the moment it s actually interesting because a whole lot of new material has come into the public domain erm whereas after the well the research work by one or two really erm well established historians
1	oh
1	about the lead up to nineteen fourteen
1	mm
1	and why it happened
1	mm
1	erm and i was looking at a lot of those books and they are erm very interesting
1	okay
1	very interesting indeed erm pause dur short so i i shall go back to it and try and finish it off
1	mm
1	i think
1	you were right about general anaesthetics and things though i think you do get knocked sideways don t you by these things that come along and you think you can bounce back and young people think they can bounce back perhaps they can when they re younger but it s just takes longer
1	i think they can when they re younger yes i just found that after three hours in in the british library if you you stop for a sandwich at lunchtime and you go back and sit down at two o clock half past two i m
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh falling asleep
1	i know
1	but vocal desc laugh
1	that s very sad isn t it vocal desc gasp how what is it
1	well
1	i ve never been there actually i meant to join and er
1	oh it
1	i believe i could join but
1	it s it i think it s superb actually
1	uhu
1	i think it s very good i i don t know what the er the the it s in two parts erm there are some nineteen seventy five onwards
1	mm
1	and trunc ev trunc everything earlier than that and so erm er what s it called i trunc thi trunc i i think they call it a a antique or something like that no unclear inch unclear i can t remember what they call it anyway erm rare books and something erm i always worked in that department
1	uhu
1	because the stuff that i ve been looking at was published in the nineteenth century or trunc wha trunc eighteenth century and seventeenth century
1	uhu
1	erm and it s very well equipped and the atmosphere is very you know you you you re not disturbed
1	no
1	that s the beauty of the place is that it s quiet and er
1	studious atmosphere
1	a studious atmosphere
1	yeah vocal desc laugh that s nice i find
1	yeah and there s plenty of room and the staff are extremely helpful
1	mm
1	they re very helpful indeed
1	oh that s good
1	i was amazed in fact because erm pause dur short one of the things that happened was that i i went to the spanish national archives in near valladolid
1	uhu
1	in a place called salamanca and erm to my horror when i got there i found nobody but nobody could speak english
1	ah
1	and i also
1	you need to go away from the coast in spain
1	er vocal desc laugh i was just that the there s got to be a er what surprised me even more there was no catalogue
1	vocal desc gasp
1	erm other than the catalogue which had been written by some er well i suppose amateur in eighteen nineteen or eighteen twenty
1	oh
1	and but all
1	really
1	all the papers sort of period from fourteen seventy seven to seventeen fifteen they re all located in this one place which actually makes it very easy
1	mm
1	from the point of view of you know what you re looking for is there
1	yeah
1	and and all the
1	vocal desc laugh
1	earlier documents i d i d not come across this before are not trunc w trunc not mm well not in this form they are all in tubes and these tubes go right back to the seventeenth century
1	oh wow
1	erm and you ask for a i the the lady who was sort of erm i don t know if she was appointed to look after them or somehow she she took to looking after me erm she couldn t speak english but she knew that philip the second had been married to bloody mary
1	uhu
1	which was what i was interested in
1	mm
1	and after talking to her vocal desc laugh a lot of writing and drawing and trunc var trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	using a dictionary mainly cos er there s no electronics there s no you can t there s trunc n trunc you you can t use your erm laptop you can use an ordinary typing
1	yeah
1	but you can t use it for research at all because there s nothing is is trunc on trunc online
1	how extraordinary
1	and erm anyway
1	it has revolutionised things since this stuff
1	oh absolutely
1	when you put it online
1	absolutely this good lady erm she s she eventually trunc sh trunc she trunc under trunc understood what i was interested in and she produced for me the inventory of erm vladimir s household
1	mm
1	erm from a visit of er of philip the second to
1	oh
1	this country and it was er riveting erm it was one of these things that had been rolled up as if you
1	yeah
1	quite a long thing
1	yeah
1	and it listed literally every member of the staff
1	yeah
1	and all their clothes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and all their food allowance
1	oh really
1	i d never seen anything like it
1	oh how exciting
1	it s a masterpiece of bureaucracy
1	oh vocal desc laugh
1	incredible
1	wow
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and that was the sort of was that the the big initial meeting between them when they were sort of circling each other and deciding whether they were going to have a a political union and a
1	it well well
1	unclear
1	yes i mean there were a lot of correspondences there before she got married
1	mm
1	and then there is his visit here
1	mm
1	and that was a thing which was i wanted to really to see what er i could find out
1	mm
1	but without having a really working knowledge of of spanish and ancient spanish castilian erm i find it very very difficult indeed
1	wow yeah
1	er so i have to rely on other people s erm
1	yeah
1	er trunc f trunc first primary work
1	yes
1	there is a lot of primary work easily available
1	yes
1	and fortunately erm
1	but you ve got er trunc t trunc it s the time isn t it to
1	it s the trunc ti trunc it s the time
1	to go through it
1	yeah absolutely right
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	it is amazing now with with kew what you can get online and we were stumped in our with our family history there was one insuperable obstacle that we couldn t get past and then all of a sudden one day it just popped up online
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know and then it s just simple
1	yeah
1	it s straightforward all these other things fall immediately into place but you know until that point it was the sort of date we didn t know whether two individuals had got divorced and if so when it when it might be or where it might have taken place or whatever and so we trunc did trunc we couldn t work out where one of them had gone because we couldn t work out what you know where she had gone to afterwards
1	yeah
1	and then and then erm just when you know trunc the trunc then all of a sudden somebody s done this work and has put it online and it s fantastic it opens these fantastic vistas
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that saved so much time it would have been otherwise would have been days and days and days and days and days at kew going through
1	trunc ano trunc er er another er strange erm experience er pure coincidence er there will be a er a good lady erm with us on the twenty ninth called
1	uhu
1	anon nametype f type name and she works for the bbc
1	uhu
1	and erm i had
1	are they related to the anon nametype n type name the anon nametype n type name with
1	well it s spelt anon nametype n type name
1	oh right well obviously
1	it s unclear
1	oh yeah no no no difference by then yes
1	an italian name
1	yeah oh right
1	she s not italian at all but erm any rate erm i er met her when i went to anon type place university
1	uhu
1	she s er by training a erm a violinist and she s also the national uk national expert on schoenberg does that mean anything to you schoenberg
1	vaguely i ve heard of the name but i don t know er
1	he was a unclear
1	oh really oh right okay yes
1	yeah anyway erm i made friends with her ages ago when she was a student and so on and i always kept in touch with her pause dur short any rate it was you know two thousand i i wanted to look at some papers in the hofburg which is the the equivalent of buckingham palace in vienna
1	uhu
1	and the there s a marvellous court library with the hofbibliothek it s er in the building itself is fantastic and what s in it is equally fantastic
1	mm
1	and i er a lot of it is the national library and is open like the british library is you just go in and say there s my british library ticket which they accept and you just ask for what you want
1	uhu
1	but there s part of it where all the very special erm delicate and erm er prized works are are
1	yeah
1	kept and they re all kept in trunc lo trunc under lock and key in this amazing erm er building
1	mm
1	er designed by a man called fischer von erlach i don t know if you ve heard of his but the leading block architecture er architect and er erm it was closed
1	uhu
1	and er well and i i suddenly saw that anon nametype f type name was with er two of her colleagues with a a camera and recording equipment er and i i d
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i went over to her and i said hello anon nametype f type name what are you doing here
1	vocal desc laugh
1	she said i m making a programme
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i said really she said why are you here and i said well i wanted to go and look into some papers in the trunc o trunc on hofbibliothek and and actually i find it s closed oh she said no problem erm i
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i i think i can sort that one out cos that s where we re making a programme you can become a member of the bbc staff for the day
1	oh how wonderful
1	and so
1	how wonderful
1	i got into this and and one of the things they were actually looking at er er concerts which were put on between nineteen hundred and nineteen fourteen
1	mm
1	and what was done to promote schoenberg it
1	mm
1	it was quite a an esoteric exercise
1	uhu
1	but it coincided with and it er i think it s the year nineteen nineteen seven i trunc thi trunc about about then the first decade there was a a frightful winter
1	mm
1	and appalling floods
1	mm
1	in the danube basin and erm the people at the trunc m trunc there was a person working in the library who came up to me and she said i i was er er wanted to know about the mm er what had been the way in which the austrian foreign ministry worked and thoroughly boring
1	vocal desc laugh
1	academic stuff and this person came over and said what are trunc y trunc er can i help are you looking for something and i said well i actually i want to know how much to what extent the emperor was involved over the bosnia crisis in nineteen eight and so on oh he said that s the that s the erm the the the the year when there was this frightful weather come with me and i ll show you something interesting and he showed me this whole set of photographs
1	mm
1	which were taken of the the emperor going and visiting the villages which had been flooded
1	oh
1	and i mean it was absolutely fascinating
1	how amazing
1	erm they were quite informal and the other thing that this man said he said er this is the time when the austrians decided that they needed to have a navy a proper navy they all
1	uhu
1	that they ought to have a dreadnought
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and it there is a er a special exhibition on at the what they call the the trunc au trunc er it s the trunc a trunc austrian army museum
1	mm
1	he said go there and you will see something which is really unique so i went and you had to book in and at eleven o clock on er
1	vocal desc misc
1	friday morning and so on and trunc any trunc anyway went into it sat down in this tiny little theatre place with a er erm one of those er er cine camera things with two reels
1	oh yeah
1	two big reels on the top
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	and and you could hear it whirring away
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and what they d got was the newsreel of the launch of er trunc th trunc this battle ship er at pula and it er it it showed the awful blunder that they made
1	mm
1	the ship was constructed and up to er a hull the complete hull and first decking
1	mm
1	erm in a dry dock and it was held in place by these enormous erm i suppose they were unclear i don t know but er timber props
1	mm
1	erm they are sort of the the the cross section of the hull
1	yeah
1	there are these timber props
1	yeah
1	and to launch this ship they opened the the er lock gate at the bottom
1	mm
1	to the let water in
1	mm
1	and they told the guys to knock the these great trunc pi trunc erm er props away
1	yeah
1	so that the ship would slide out into the into the into into the sea
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	what they didn t realise was that when the ship went into the er into the water it would cause an enormous displacement of water
1	vocal desc laugh
1	into the dock
1	oh no
1	and there were these poor people who were drowned
1	vocal desc gasp
1	and it was all on the film
1	oh no
1	yeah it was
1	oh my lord
1	er quite extraordinary and horrifying
1	oh my word
1	and there was this stand you could see everything because it showed franz ferdinand and trunc h trunc his his would be wife sophie hohenberg erm and all the other dignitaries er there to launch this ship and all that kind of thing and there were these poor people being drowned at their feet
1	oh my word pause dur short oh
1	horrifying
1	oh my word
1	yeah
1	that s shocking isn t it
1	yeah
1	oh
1	anyway pause dur short it s produced some all of my activities looking work for the er researching for this book have led me to some weird places
1	yeah vocal desc laugh it sounds like doesn t it
1	i ve been been to the ukraine
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and the problem is the problem unclear vocal desc laugh at the moment
1	yeah gosh
1	and vocal desc laugh
1	gosh well no it was always a hugely wide ranging piece of work
1	yeah so i dunno i hope i ll finish it
1	i don t know
1	i should but
1	have you thought about doing different volumes and
1	er i i ve i showed the first half of the first part i ve written to a publisher and vocal desc laugh he was a bit dismissive erm he said what why did you write it and i said well no it s er purely out of personal interest he said oh mm very good textbook vocal desc laugh so anyway but a textbook is not a bad thing to have produced because of the fact it s bread and butter
1	well well quite
1	and
1	i mean i find that there s
1	if if if
1	nothing wrong with textbooks i mean what is the historian to do without a textbook and he
1	well exactly yes we have to start somewhere
1	yeah
1	then you build up on it yeah
1	and things that aren t textbooks someone can be very suspect vocal desc laugh
1	yes exactly yes
1	things written by journalists who
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	knew nothing about it last year
1	yes
1	and now are experts
1	yes vocal desc laugh yeah
1	all these er my pet hates when you have people like simon schama or andrew marr who
1	andrew marr is a mm pause dur short no
1	no vocal desc laugh
1	he is not a historian
1	but they sort of stride about and they say
1	yes
1	within fifty years the whole of europe was catholic

1	yeah that s it yeah
1	do you get cramp often
1	erm er fairly frequently yeah
1	do you
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well trunc w trunc well for the tape we re sitting in a very small trunc sig trunc erm ticket office here at the model engineers and anon nametype m type name is with me this morning and he s going to talk about well why are you a model engineer
1	i think it s an engineering background my father was
1	ah
1	a civil engineer
1	right
1	and erm i studied trunc u trunc er engineering at at college actually and then erm went into engineering initially as a trunc po trunc as a post as a erm graduate apprentice for anon type place
1	right right
1	erm ending up at their applied research laboratories at anon type place
1	right
1	and er working on just er to start with guided weapons and then on er satellite communications
1	very interesting
1	then i erm formed a company with a couple of friends and erm we sold printing equipment all over the world vocal desc laugh
1	right printing equipment
1	yeah we actually modify we actually produce modifications for existing equipment
1	right
1	erm we d all worked for one company who was at the time was a majorly a brand leader in the area and we produced electronics for the print industry
1	right right because erm in the in the i i worked for newspapers for quite a long time for about sixteen years i worked for the anon type place and did you do anything at all with with the anon type place the anon type place press
1	i i never really used to trunc sp trunc unclear most unclear most of my time was spent in the laboratory i
1	right
1	i i ran the r and b department
1	right right
1	and erm
1	erm right so you were research and development and erm really you re the boffin behind the the engineering not not the sales person or the
1	no occasionally we we d trunc g trunc go out to see customers when there was
1	right
1	a particular trunc k trunc a particular problem the company was small enough so that you erm er everybody had a go at everything practically
1	right right and how many people were there in your company
1	er the maximum it was about thirty
1	right
1	but most of the time it was about twelve fifteen something like that
1	right right and erm you must have seen a lot of changes with printing techniques over the years
1	erm yes erm the er i worked for trunc t trunc two companies erm before trunc b trunc going independent one was anon type place
1	yes
1	and so i saw the development of the scanner from the early analogue scanners to the later digital scanners and so on
1	right
1	and then it moved to unclear a liner type unclear and produced one of their trunc desi trunc er or designed one of their miniature scanners which er was the er sort of last generation before the desktop really took over and er
1	yes
1	people started using small flatbeds
1	yes i remember the erm in there was a sort of like a it was like a piece of cardboard er was it called unclear dycron unclear trunc di trunc er er er a system where it was impressed on a piece of card and then that was impressed onto a roll that was put on a roll and then it was rolled out what
1	oh
1	was that method called that came somewhere in the middle
1	trunc y trunc yes i ve i i well i never worked on the press side so i i
1	oh you didn t well they adopted
1	it was purely
1	that method at one stage and what the the card the residue cardboard that they left behind i used to paint on i used to sort of try and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	bend it back the other way and paint on the back
1	yes
1	but that was very interesting
1	yeah
1	i wish i hadn t got rid of some of those though they were er they might be worth something today erm but er a lot of erm these processes they re good for a while and then they just go don t they
1	they do yes i mean the the although some of the high quality work is still done on the kind of scanners
1	yeah
1	i worked on
1	yes
1	most of it s now gone to the flatbeds which you put on your desktop
1	yes yeah in the metallic printing erm they ve still got in anon type place university and a lot of the universities now and in the art departments they use old printing blocks
1	yes
1	a lot of the time and they put
1	yeah
1	you see it trunc in trunc integrated in art and erm i have erm two blocks that i use for my initials when i do a painting i frequently you ink them up and stick them on at the bottom if they re in a piece of abstract work i mean it s not relevant in something that s smaller but er yeah so erm and and now you ve retired and erm have trunc ha trunc er what have you got on the go as far as engines concerns er any engines at all
1	er yes i tend to build things in parallel because i like
1	right
1	to be able to swap between different scales and
1	yeah
1	different sizes
1	oh right
1	and so i m building a two and a half inch gauge model of one of the american er wartime austerity locomotives
1	oh right
1	a five inch gauge manning wardle
1	oh right
1	and a seven and a quarter inch gauge hunslet
1	not much then vocal desc laugh
1	no no just just enough to keep me happy
1	vocal desc laugh so how much time do you spend in the workshop every day do you think
1	erm it obviously varies but er erm i quite often spend the whole day in the workshop
1	do you
1	cos it s
1	yeah yeah and do you find that if you don t get your model engineering done it trunc ma trunc it impacts on your erm er humour
1	not particularly no but i i do trunc s trunc yes i i you do suffer from withdrawal symptoms
1	vocal desc laugh
1	if you don t er vocal desc laugh get your fix occasionally
1	it yes erm i notice erm obviously cos i live with anon nametype m type name i i i notice that he he gets he trunc does trunc he he never gets cross but he he does get slightly irritated i think if he can t get and do what he wants to do he feel he he s in a middle of a project and he wants to and anon nametype m type name was saying the same you know he he he just gets very disgruntled if he can t get on with it
1	i think probably we trunc a trunc we all tend to feel that way yes
1	yeah yeah
1	but er
1	and i m the same with my art if i ve got to if i m diverted by doing housework or things that i really don t want to do i i do get grumpy
1	yes
1	and i need to get erm i do i actually get very temperamental altogether so i ve just got to get in there and do it you you see so you ve been coming on these working parties now for how long
1	virtually since i joined the clubs
1	really
1	about five years
1	five years yeah yeah
1	one one time there were only three of us who normally turned up
1	right
1	erm anon nametype m type name erm anon nametype m type name and myself
1	right
1	and so erm i also edit the magazine so i m dubbed as the three musketeers
1	oh right
1	er er how did it work out anon nametype m type name anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and anon nametype m type name
1	yes
1	yes i like it erm cos anon nametype m type name did anon type place for a while didn t he
1	he did yeah
1	and now you re doing it
1	yes i do it
1	so i was i was going to i know that i m too late for this edition er but i want to put a little thank you in anon type place to everybody who s erm who s you know given their fifteen minutes to
1	yeah
1	and also at the same time put something in to ask if there are any other members who would like to talk at some time when i come back
1	mm yes
1	so erm so how are you finding the challenge of doing anon type place
1	oh it s interesting yes
1	yeah
1	i quite enjoy it yes
1	you do yeah
1	yes i think it i think it s getting to the point having done it for now about three or four years i that it s er time that i
1	oh trunc ri trunc
1	hand it over to somebody else
1	oh right
1	for them to er
1	oh so now you ve been doing it for three or four years and then anon nametype m type name was before you was he or
1	he he was yes
1	he was yes so i m right out of date because
1	mm
1	isn t it funny how the years go on and you still think oh it s still think it s anon nametype m type name and in fact it s yourself so
1	mm
1	dreadful so you you how much time does that take up
1	erm it takes up most of a week basically
1	does it
1	to put each er
1	yeah
1	each edition together
1	trunc th trunc
1	erm
1	that s a big contribution as a volunteer isn t it really
1	er yes it is er
1	but it s your hobby as well
1	it that s right it is
1	yeah yeah but erm have you ever thought of having a woman s page in anon type place
1	erm i ve never had a contributor vocal desc laugh who give me any any contribution but i d welcome it yes anything new i mean it s
1	anything new
1	yeah
1	i was actually thinking about this erm show you re planning next year and erm thinking of having trunc s trunc i mean i i m a member of the model engineers because anon nametype m type name always pays for me to be a member i wonder how many other of the ladies are trunc me trunc actual members and if they are erm whether we ought to have some sort of contribution in there because we are actually members and i sometimes think
1	yes
1	trunc noth trunc nothing big just just you know just some lines every now and then would be nice vocal desc laugh
1	well we do have contributions from the various sections
1	yeah yeah
1	of the at the anon type place library
1	yeah
1	erm occasionally from the unclear tickers unclear and erm
1	yes
1	so yes it was no real reason why there shouldn t be a section
1	no i
1	trunc e trunc even put something in from the nomads occasionally
1	do you vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah so erm erm when you were doing your job originally looking back at the beginning of your career after you left university erm did you did you sort of fall into that erm way of working or did or was it something that you really wanted to do
1	oh no i i knew i wanted to go into design and development
1	right
1	into r and d right from the start
1	yeah yeah
1	and erm say i although i ve erm i er well trunc whe trunc we started the company i was a director of the company so i had trunc re trunc responsibilities
1	right
1	as a director
1	right
1	but erm i was always involved the technical side yes
1	right what would you say over the years was the most satisfying project you worked on
1	oh that s difficult erm
1	or one of them you know
1	erm well in some respects the the well when we were working when we were er became independent erm we erm produced an interface between the established erm graphic art scanners
1	right
1	er and the desktop
1	right
1	and we were virtually the first people in the world to do this so we
1	right
1	erm one year
1	that was an achievement yes
1	yeah one year we exported ninety two percent of our product
1	really
1	and we got a queen s award for industry for it
1	my goodness
1	erm so it was that was perhaps the most in some respects the most interesting
1	yeah erm erm
1	and so
1	where were where did you export it
1	erm we a lot went er to the states
1	right
1	erm one of the directors was married to a japanese lady
1	oh right
1	and we exported quite a lot to japan
1	yes
1	erm and in and the rest of europe in general
1	right
1	we had quite an active agent in germany
1	right
1	and erm so virtually the whole of the world
1	the but it because you were more er you were obviously research and development did you you did get sometimes obviously a chance to go to these places did you or or travel at all
1	er yes in erm er my wife had a a horse and we had a horse box
1	oh right
1	so the my company car was a erm a discovery
1	right
1	and that was used to tow the company s trailer whenever we went to a show
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	and so i often ended up driving the thing down the autobahns to dusseldorf or somewhere vocal desc laugh
1	oh right oh i see
1	loaded with er
1	oh right
1	all sorts of bits and pieces for the show
1	yeah yeah they re very fast those autobahns aren t they well erm we lived in germany for a while and erm i think it was before we really had very many motorways er it was nineteen trunc f trunc i m talking nineteen fifty eight
1	yeah
1	and erm in those days i remember travelling on the autobahn and thinking well was it in nineteen fifty or i went back to germany in erm nineteen sixty seven as well so it could have been nineteen sixty seven but they trunc s trunc their roads seemed to be far more far faster and bigger than than what we had in england but it may be just me mm
1	yes i no i just took them vocal desc laugh took them my stride yes
1	you just er trunc y trunc yeah you do really just er
1	with three tonnes behind and a land rover
1	yeah
1	you re not gonna go very quickly anyway vocal desc laugh
1	no no and so when you were there and trunc th trunc these exhibitions you were talking to people as well were you
1	yes
1	yeah yeah
1	in fact the idea for the interface really we we first put out at a a show just to sort of see what the kind of response would be
1	yeah
1	and erm we got people from all sorts of parts of trunc th trunc of the er show
1	right
1	coming from other companies saying
1	right
1	this would be interesting so that was really what er pushed us into doing it
1	absolutely i mean i ve been to with anon nametype m type name to anon type place er anon type place where they do the huge erm industrial show for the railways and also i went to anon type place with him in fact trying to find him the place the site was so big that trying to find anon nametype m type name on the site was really difficult erm
1	yeah
1	and it took so long to get there and i used to find i d get there and find he was deep in conversation with a potential customer and which i of course wouldn t wouldn t even wink at him you know
1	mm
1	erm and then i d have to find all my way back vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so erm it was a bit of a shame really and erm you know there you go but erm and that s over now and that twenty years of that erm yes it s it s over he was there a lot longer so erm did you meet your wife at work or
1	yes i did yes
1	you did
1	yes
1	oh right
1	erm i got a er call from one of the other secretaries saying that erm i knew her vaguely but not very well
1	yes
1	and er saying that she d broken down
1	right
1	and erm since i was er interested in cars then i got er it trunc w trunc it was suggested we were working late and erm i think we were about the only people around
1	yes
1	and er so suggested we went out and rescued her so
1	trunc y trunc
1	two of us went out
1	yes
1	and er we trunc m trunc er sort of struck up a friendship after that
1	oh right oh that s a very nice story
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah that s a very nice story erm so erm do you have any other hobbies mm er besides engineering i trunc mea trunc you probably don t have time but do you have anything at all that you re interested in apart
1	erm i although i haven t sailed much recently i
1	ah
1	sail erm i erm restore historic cars as well vocal desc laugh
1	oh right okay
1	erm again it s probably trunc se trunc rather taken a back of a seat recently
1	yes
1	erm pause dur short oh travel all sorts of things
1	what historic car have you got at the moment
1	erm i ve got a healey silverstone which is
1	oh have you
1	the trunc m trunc the most interesting
1	oh wow
1	and erm i ve got the i built the last ever kit tvr
1	right
1	and i ve still got that as well
1	right oh right
1	so that s two of them though trunc s trunc
1	yeah that s erm er and and do you go to shows with them at all or
1	erm i i haven t done recently
1	no
1	but i have done occasionally in the past yes
1	it s quite nice isn t it in the summer you trunc ge trunc you know when you can get the if you ve got a a convertible or or any car really to go out and go to a show and walk round and have a look it s quite nice
1	yes my i infected my son and erm
1	oh right vocal desc laugh
1	he owns a tvr and we took one on a rally in spain
1	oh right
1	a couple of years ago which was
1	yes
1	quite fun
1	oh right goodness erm i i think erm i i used to know someone with a tvr years ago he lived over in anon type place er he ended he he got rid of it eventually and bought and e type
1	uhu
1	and i was saying this morning to erm anon nametype m type name that erm i er when i had my car accident and i was nearly burnt to death er afterwards i went out vocal desc laugh my car was obviously burnt trunc t trunc completely and i went out and bought erm an mg midget and a fur coat vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh why not
1	vocal desc laugh it was sort of it was sort of protest really you know erm as er to you know to say look right here i m back in the world you know i may not have my looks

1	mm
1	not very good surgery risks pause dur short oh god don t like looking at this pause dur short the needle er the rate of complication is low around one percent several studies have found complication rates to be higher for around five percent pause dur short that s the the operation i suppose some possible complications pause dur short splitting of the skin
1	oh god
1	with the needle pause dur short during trunc ne trunc mm pause dur short oh my pause dur short damage to the nerves supplying sensation to your fingertips pause dur short the nerves can be repaired but it s unlikely the fingers would recover their full sensation

1	i pause dur short got up pause dur short had a wash had my breakfast erm pause dur short and i went into work
1	what were you doing
1	erm we were putting the finishing touches to a pause dur short to a erm
1	a thing
1	a thing vocal desc laugh pause dur short a steel band that goes around the handrail on a wooden balcony pause dur short that so that if anyone fell against the wooden balcony
1	mm
1	and it broke it would you know its steel band would keep it all together
1	oh pause dur long
1	so we went and pause dur short the steel band s got to be galvanised so
1	galvanised being pause dur long
1	galvanised it s got to be galvanised
1	yeah pause dur short galvanised is
1	that means that it s dipped in a molten bath of zinc
1	oh yeah
1	it s cleaned with acid and then dipped in a molten bath of zinc
1	cos we often well sometimes use the word i was galvanised into action
1	yes
1	doesn t really pause dur short well anyway pause dur short i was dipped in a bowl of zinc which
1	vocal desc laugh yeah absolutely
1	which made me move vocal desc laugh
1	make you run wouldn t it
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	well there s galvanic action pause dur long galvanic action is not pause dur short believe it or not pause dur short the same as galvanising someone or something
1	it s got a specific specific erm pause dur short meaning in in metallurgy
1	mm
1	mm pause dur short okay so you got that done pause dur short yeah
1	mm pause dur short got that done we dry fitted it you anything you make in a er that s got galvanised pause dur short has got to be assembled you ve got to be able to manufacture so that it can screw together pause dur short into transportable and handleable pieces
1	mm
1	and then assembled with screws
1	mm
1	rather than something that pause dur short can be fabricated by welding it all together pause dur short and erm the reason for that is that if you pause dur short weld something that s been galvanised you destroy the galvanised coating
1	well i expect you would
1	it burns off
1	mm
1	there you go
1	mm
1	so that s what we did we did a dry run we fitted it we found out pause dur short erm where there could be pitfalls we overcame any pitfalls and then we marked positions in it to drill counter some clearance holes for screws which would pause dur short have provide pause dur short holes for the screws to fix it to the handrail
1	mm
1	so
1	we being you and anon nametype m type name yeah
1	yes pause dur short and then we erm pause dur short part of the balcony was rotten the wood and i went and bought some wood hardener which is like a mixture of resins in a pause dur short in a solvent and you paint the wood with that the the resins sink deep into the wood er pardon me the solvent vaporises and then the wood hardens the wood becomes waterproof and hard and when then you can we use just a plastic filler on top of that resin for the resin filler to fill in bits of
1	mm
1	wood to make it build it up
1	oh yeah pause dur short you get your money off anon nametype m type name then pause dur short did you get your money off anon nametype m type name
1	i did paid er for that he s put it in my bank four hundred quid he trunc pu trunc did that the other day
1	that s good
1	i was trunc thi trunc i think i ll text him because he wants me to do more work down there
1	oh splendid
1	tile the bathroom which will be a day or two days work down there fiddling around pause dur short erm pause dur short and pause dur long so that s good and and er the opportunity for me to earn a thousand quid came in
1	oh wonderful
1	so that will pay my pause dur short national insurance contributions that i owe four hundred and thirty one quid to pause dur short hurrah pause dur short and pay pay them er cos they were making noises pause dur short the government has decided to change the ways in which er
1	we we ll be unclear
1	which we are pause dur short we pay our national insurance contributions so pause dur short i now have to pause dur short well i don t have to i think pay it with your tax you pay it with the tax at the end of the year
1	do you what if you re self employed
1	well that s what they re changing it to yes
1	mm
1	which is fine by me it s great good idea
1	mm pause dur short yes it is in a way erm good part about it is you you just have to muck about with it once
1	yes exactly
1	the the downside of course is that it s a large sum
1	well they never were that er pause dur short they never pursued you very pause dur short greatly when you didn t pay it
1	mm
1	it wasn t something that they cared about much but pause dur short erm what they did do erm pause dur short er pause dur short i know that i ve got to pay one more year to qualify for my pension
1	oh yeah
1	for a full pension
1	oh good
1	i ve paid for
1	how much is that a week
1	nineteen years sorry
1	hundred and thirty five is it a week
1	probably which is good to have you know
1	yeah
1	that s alright pause dur short better than nothing and erm pause dur short yeah it ll be brilliant to have that
1	well some people have to live on that don t they
1	sorry
1	some people have to live on it
1	some people have to live on it i don t know how the hell they do i can t imagine how you one does
1	you have to be very careful
1	i would imagine you do bloody hell pause dur short erm pause dur short but er pause dur long yeah

1	oh yeah
1	and she said oh can you do my unclear iofs unclear lesson on monday morning
1	oh great yeah
1	i said yeah okay so
1	do you need any books for that
1	well yes but they ve got one she said er in the school there where i can get photocopies from pause dur short so i said right i ll i ll be er she said come come round about four o clock i said okay pause dur short so i had time to er go over the road buy my wellies and the belts and come back here and change pause dur short and er went off there pause dur short and saw her i saw her boss first of all who s also an iofs examiner and he was telling me that he goes up to london pause dur short to examine
1	oh right
1	because there s not much in anon type place you know they don t you know
1	yeah
1	and i thought well that s trunc n trunc i don t really wanna go up to london and he said and he said well pause dur short erm it s only er an hour on the train
1	right
1	and it s er right behind anon type place station
1	there you go
1	so i said oh okay pause dur short but it s er the they run it differently from pause dur short china cos er here
1	yeah
1	it s er you get paid i think eight pound fifty for one interview and eight pound for a writing script
1	right
1	and what most of the examiners do they they do boo both speaking and writing but i never used to do writing
1	right
1	because you in china you have to be on bc premises that means you have to live in one of the four centres
1	right
1	like in shanghai you you have to go actually go there so that s why he works there so what examiners do is that you only get about pause dur short a a dozen interviews pause dur short er and then they do mark er mark the writing scripts
1	right
1	and that s how they they make their money in a day
1	yeah
1	erm but it it wouldn t be worth it for me cos i d trunc onl trunc i m only certified er for erm for the speaking and it just wouldn t be worth it you know pause dur short especially erm the after if you haven t tested for three months er then you have to you trunc d trunc do six and they check to see if you re
1	right
1	still
1	right
1	marking accurately and then you can go for the full but in like in china you go for the weekend you stay in a five star hotel
1	yeah
1	and er you do thirty interviews for the weekend and er you know get about four hundred quid
1	fucking nora
1	for the erm for the weekend
1	that s amazing
1	but here it s it just doesn t seem like it s worth it you know if if it s in brighton it would be worth it but not not going up to london pause dur short anyway he gave me a phone number of a woman to contact pause dur short so i was chatting with the director of studies about what she wanted me to do pause dur short and it was only er an hour and a half class on monday morning pause dur short and the way she described it is er pause dur short they don t seem to pause dur short be all that good as a school really cos er she said the type of work i can offer you at the moment is er is trunc co trunc on cover pause dur short you know if if somebody er
1	if someone s sick
1	is calls in sick
1	yeah
1	and they she ll call me up
1	yeah
1	like half an hour s notice and say oh can you
1	oh
1	come in straight away and do it of course you trunc ca trunc haven t got any time for preparation right
1	god
1	you ve got to wing it pause dur short er which of course i could do but pause dur short you fixed it
1	yeah
1	oh you re brilliant
1	vocal desc cough
1	what was wrong with it
1	well in there pause dur short behind if you open it pause dur short if you open it and withdraw the just open it click you little lever and open it
1	mm pause dur short oh
1	no open it pause dur short that s it now if you see the little round button here
1	here
1	well that is hollow and in the back of there s a magnet
1	yeah
1	and the magnet is not a fixed it s loose in there it s trunc w trunc er and when you click that up to it pulls it off the magnet well
1	ah
1	what happen is the magnet gets loose because it s loose it can jam up in there
1	oh and that s what happened
1	and the magnet jammed up in there
1	oh you clever chap thank you very much
1	that s alright
1	put it on my bill
1	yeah okay
1	so erm anyway pause dur short she at first first of all she started er saying oh er can you do reading exercises and er so i said yeah alright pause dur short and but in the end we decided that i was gonna do writing pause dur short and er pause dur short but the way
1	i thought you didn t do writing
1	yeah but i can teach it pause dur short i can t
1	examine it
1	i can t be an examiner
1	oh i see
1	but pause dur short anyway so we went through er what she wanted me to do and i i gave her my ideas and pause dur short said right i ll need some photocopies of this and this she said yeah okay we ll get all that done for monday morning pause dur short er i said well trunc cou trunc could i come in on sunday and they re closed at the weekends which for me is a very strange
1	yes
1	concept because er pause dur short in china everybody works seven days a week you know vocal desc laugh if you re the sort of language schools things and the weekends is the busiest time
1	yes pause dur short yeah
1	but not here
1	no
1	anyway pause dur short so monday morning i ve got my first lesson

1	by the arcade
1	by the arcade yeah gotcha
1	so and it s a trunc st trunc first step you know
1	of course
1	it s a first
1	oh absolutely
1	you know it s
1	i m i m i m fully behind you there
1	so
1	i m not bemoaning the dosh i just think it s brilliant
1	mm
1	you know you ve got er pause dur short you know you will soon you re brilliant at this
1	oh yeah i forgot i forgot to tell you when i was talking to this guy this arab guy he s called anon nametype m type name

1	yeah
1	i said what would this be er in the middle east he said yes probably maybe a er pause dur short saudi arabia or qatar
1	yeah
1	i said and i was sort of very thinking very quickly and i said well i ve already pause dur short erm seen adverts for jobs over there and i also one of my ex colleagues er works in er saudi arabia and he lives on a compound and it sounds mm a bit isolated and all the rest of it and i said but but i said the reason i m hesitating is that you know i ve got a commitment in the summer to go and see my daughter er he said oh yes yeah of course of course er pause dur short so so anyway in the end i just said er you know i ll send him my cv and pause dur short
1	did he give you a an email address
1	well i ve got his card
1	right
1	where is it
1	well that s fantastic
1	mm
1	if he can get you something sorted out with er pause dur short head of studies blimey go for it pause dur long vocal desc laugh that might be the thing that is fantastic buys you a little flat and er keeps your daughter in pause dur short
1	yeah well
1	whatever
1	it s erm pause dur short i was telling him that the way i work as a teacher on one to ones
1	yes
1	and i said whenever i get a new student i cos they always think or hope that they can pause dur short make tremendous strides in a short time
1	right
1	you know and i tell them straight away like it is you know it s it takes a lot of study
1	yes
1	to improve your standard of english you re not gonna do it it s not gonna be done quickly
1	no
1	er so that s the way i work i try and be honest and fair you know and tell them like it is from the start
1	of course
1	erm pause dur short so er pause dur short i erm pause dur short i said that and he said well yeah that s er er that s good pause dur short and so pause dur short er i hope that well i ll i ll send him my cv tonight
1	yes
1	and er er in a week or two i ll pop in and just say hi and just do trunc c trunc cos pause dur short he s obviously pause dur short been an important man and is and is still
1	unclear
1	you know is if he s still giving talks at you know at anon type place university to
1	on what
1	oh he s just telling welcoming everybody who come and er for the er talk and
1	what s he talking on about
1	well it was just welcoming people to the reason what they re i don t know what the reason was everybody pause dur short congregated there had been summoned but he he d been asked to give a talk so well a welcoming speech or something like that
1	right
1	and obviously i m everything he told me i believed
1	right
1	you know he s obviously been er some different stages in his life a very important man pause dur short with a lot of contacts
1	yeah
1	so i don t think it was bullshit pause dur short so er anyway it s it s good to build up pause dur short a relationship i ll just pop in and say hi you know pause dur short so er all in all
1	that sounds wonderful
1	it was right quite a positive day
1	absolutely yeah pause dur short sounds brilliant
1	got a potential pause dur short useful contact
1	yeah
1	and got my first pause dur short teaching er for my first lesson
1	fantastic
1	for months so
1	that s brilliant
1	can t complain really
1	brilliant
1	mm
1	i would have thought though you could have commanded more money from than going in or on the chance of doing something for being called in for an emergency to cover is for fourteen quid an hour is seems to me
1	it s it s
1	crazy
1	it is pause dur short but beggars can t be choosers you know i i m doing it
1	sure yeah
1	because i ve got nothing else to do
1	yeah
1	except write off for jobs and it s gonna get me out of the house it s gonna get me teaching again
1	yes
1	thinking about teaching
1	yes
1	i m gonna make contacts
1	yes
1	and trunc i trunc it s it s it s things like this one thing can lead to another you know
1	sure yeah no that s true that s true
1	so
1	for sure
1	i know it s it s pitiful money
1	it seems outrageous
1	it is pause dur short but that s that s the way it is for just casual work pause dur short but trunc lo trunc look at anon nametype m type name and how much trouble he s got finding any work i mean building labourer driver anything
1	is it bad did he say it was bad then
1	well he he told me that he d he d he s trying for all sorts of things writing off and he mentioned that er as far as driving jobs go he s pause dur short he s er he s got convictions for trunc dri trunc you know and er he s
1	yeah
1	he he said well they ll just give me a chance and i ll even pay half the er increased cost of the insurance
1	uhu
1	yeah if they take him on and that kind of thing so i think he s pretty desperate to
1	to work
1	to get work
1	yeah i m sure he is
1	and he
1	i m sure he is yeah i just yeah pause dur short i have a deeply suspicious nature and and a paranoia about people anyway because i ve been fucked and stuffed and ripped off and done over too many times sometimes for thousands of pounds so
1	mm
1	you know
1	well
1	i i
1	you know
1	i i i i ve lived with people who just fucking lie vocal desc laugh they lie and lie and lie
1	well i mean i don t know
1	and i just
1	maybe he is but i trunc s trunc
1	so no no no no i but i i m i i i tend to go along with what you think about it but
1	i think he is trying
1	yeah i m sure yeah
1	but yesterday the positive thing he was er said er you know hello to him and said oh how are you he said oh i m find yeah so it s like he said yeah i feel a lot better i said oh that s good and i went yes yes er and erm not that anything particular happened i think he s just pause dur short doing what i m trying to do pause dur short dig himself out of this pause dur short dark hole of depression you know and he seems like he s succeeding he s a lot perkier and er
1	that s good
1	i said er you know i said oh good you know well done erm i said you know some people look they look at a situation and they see a problem and other people they look at it and they see an opportunity so
1	yeah
1	and he said yeah absolutely so it seems like he s got his motivation there you know like he he seemed like he was down the other day
1	yeah
1	he seems a lot better in that er aspect or respect
1	that s good
1	and er
1	well maybe it was partly the job getting him down
1	i don t know i i didn t ask him about you know did he leave or was he pushed
1	yes
1	i thought well if he if he wants me to know he ll tell me you know pause dur short so pause dur short oh i m starting to do it you know vocal desc laugh

1	yes pause dur short but er
1	you know what does it mean
1	what do you prefer do you prefer that or the american rising rising inflection
1	you know vocal desc laugh
1	rising trunc inflex trunc
1	you know erm
1	what is it you
1	well it s not just american
1	well
1	it s er australians speak like that as well
1	well there you go
1	as well
1	both both fucking annoying people
1	vocal desc laugh well i d prefer if nobody says it because i was from a a teaching point of view if er somebody asks me well what does it mean pause dur short and how i would explain it it it really doesn t serve much purpose it s actually called classified as what s called a discourse marker and pause dur short i trunc thi trunc i was trying to find another meaning you could substitute for it erm i suppose pause dur short you could say it s short for er do you know what i mean which is serves the same purpose er almost like a what we call a a tag question when tag questions are trunc n trunc
1	i think it s it s searching for reassurance that the person who s being told the information or the story is following it and understanding it and i think i believe they re they re they re asking for
1	mm
1	confirmation
1	confirmation
1	of that
1	mm
1	so it may be the that erm and there s also a certain sense of something you know sharing about it
1	mm
1	when they say you know you know it s rather like
1	mm yeah
1	having a fag together
1	yeah
1	or a beer it s you know you re you re joining in a story and
1	mm
1	you re becoming you re you re sort of bonding
1	it s to encourage
1	people s common experience
1	it s to encourage active listening pause dur short isn t it rather than passive listening where somebody s
1	yeah
1	just sitting there and
1	yes
1	active listening is when you re involved and you you do some pause dur short trunc u trunc utter some kind of
1	yeah
1	response oh yes you know or things like this you know
1	unless
1	yes i agree or
1	unless the person talking is also addressing their their erm pause dur short ego vocal desc laugh or or talking to themselves perhaps pause dur short
1	mm pause dur short yes
1	i don t know pause dur short maybe we do maybe we do talk to ourselves pause dur short maybe it s said trunc i trunc in pause dur short in parenthesis in in in a way pause dur short it s er pause dur short to ourselves how about that
1	mm
1	there s something to think about
1	mm
1	wow
1	well i m sure some academic has written some paper on it pause dur long another thing i find very annoying in common parlance especially in young people is this overused word like pause dur short like i was doing this like it s unreal like like and it it s well everything s like nothing is actually real it s it s vocal desc laugh er like vocal desc laugh pause dur short so i said like erm
1	what instead of saying comparable to pause dur short you could compare it to that sort of
1	well again it it s it s it doesn t serve much
1	vocal desc cough
1	communicative purpose it s just a habit that people copy pause dur long i suppose when we were young we had pause dur short words that were everybody used in that generation like one springs to mind is cool pause dur short every
1	is
1	all the trunc ki trunc cool oh that s cool
1	well that s what the kids say now
1	do they still do it
1	yes oh yes
1	yes oh okay pause dur short or far out pause dur short far out man
1	no they don t say that
1	no they don t say it any more
1	that s old fashioned
1	yeah so every generation s got its er
1	i say it to them because to my son and use as many obtuse words that i can remember from my youth because it makes him and his friends giggle vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and he says people don t say that any more dad
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so i i
1	just old farts like you
1	it encourages it to trunc m trunc use it even more
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh oh
1	well i suppose i d better get back to my emails pause dur long

0	he put there
0	three cards got so many cards this card said well done for finding this present up to now you might want a break so i recommend that you go to this particular bar and order this particular drink and i was like oh my god

0	may may have slightly caused vocal desc laugh some emotional harm
0	to so okay have you heard the story of anon nametype m type name
0	miss anon nametype n type name yeah
0	so oh la la so we re erm
0	time of it either and vocal desc laugh so we re in geography erm and we re playing the resources game do you know the kind of rough unclear premise on about unclear so like where everyone is a country for the lesson and you have a task to do and you have a set number of resources the more economically er stable the country and erm er more you know what i m on about where what s what s the name for it
0	ledc and medc
0	classic
0	in this case resources were i trunc w trunc it s cos you had to cut out erm pieces of paper into shapes unclear
0	oh nice so you actually have the scissors or the
0	so some people but some people would be rich in natural resources so like
0	vocal desc laugh
0	if you come over and do half the work with me i will give you a third of my winnings and skittles with the money so you were producing with trunc s trunc scissors and paper
0	unclear okay unclear yeah
0	okay
1	erm pause dur short and it s i bought that recorder actually to try to record birdsong because i m hopeless at identifying birdsong and i thought i ve got a dvd but you watch the dvd then you go out in the woods and you can t remember so i thought if i recorded stuff while i was out there pause dur short i could come back and play it and immediately watch the dvd and try to identify what i d heard and it does it trunc work trunc you re walking through the woods and yes it picks up birds from quite a distance away but i ve never actually got around to to listening to them trying to it s really difficult you you press record and the damn thing shuts up again pause dur short erm or you press record and you get fifteen different birds all calling vocal desc laugh at the same time in different with different songs and it s just
1	we ll have to buy you one of those clocks have you seen the clocks where er er every so there are twelve different bird songs so at
1	mm
1	on the hour at one o clock two o clock three o clock
1	mm
1	then you will get a different bird tweeting and it s like a
1	and does it tell you what it is
1	erm i haven t investigated cos i haven t vocal desc cough we vocal desc cough pause dur short we don t have clocks that chime or but erm
1	yeah yeah
1	but erm yeah we ll have to investigate yeah i i presume i presume certainly if it it ll tell you when you get with the instructions of the box you ll get you know at one o clock you will hear i presume and i think there are also pictures on the face
1	right
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i m looking very dubious though cos i can imagine it keeping me awake all night vocal desc laugh
1	well you d have to have it in here always
1	yeah but i sleep with with i normally have that door open cos i get up from time to time and get a drink of water or something so
1	mm
1	that wouldn t necessarily stop me hearing it
1	ah right no that that might not be a good idea
1	put it this way pause dur short i bought i used to have a lovely little erm alarm clock which was really neat for travelling and everything pause dur short which was in my bedroom and it broke i d had it for years and years and it broke and it just i you know i thought the battery had gone and i d replace it and no it didn t unclear so i went to buy another one and i all i was looking for at that point was something small and neat bought it brought it home first night i had to put it i just couldn t take it cos the tick was too loud
1	mm
1	so pause dur short i went again i mean they re only little cheap things from the market so i went again and said look i ve got to listen to this before i take it you know and buy i m gonna buy another one and i listened to it and in the shop it was that was the quietest one he d got it was really quiet fine i bring it home here i can t it s ridiculously loud in my bedroom i can t stand the thing unclear put it out in the hall and even in the hall with the bedroom door open i could hear it ticking vocal desc laugh pause dur short it must depend on what it s standing on
1	erm vocal desc cough pause dur short does such a thing exist as a digital little really tiny alarm clock they must mustn t they
1	i guess
1	where you can actually set it for eight thirty six whatever because at the moment i m the alarm clock i ve got i mean it wakes me up vaguely when i want to be woken up
1	mm
1	but i can t put it to quarter
1	mobile
1	well or ten past eight or quarter to eight
1	i use my mobile
1	oh right okay
1	which is why i haven t bothered to replace the clock
1	mm
1	i mean i want i like to have i like to know what i always wake up in the night at least once often two or three times and i like to know what time it is and the only way i can do it at the moment is to switch the light on and look at me watch pause dur short but pause dur short it s not worth the price having something ticking cos it really does irritate you
1	mm well i mean mine ticks you didn t hear mine did you through the wall
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	cos it you do hear it you do hear it but i mean mine s good because it s it s luminous and so you know you wake up in the night and you do know what time it is without switching the lights on and stuff but as i say it it you can t make to sort of
1	no no
1	accuracy and sometimes in the morning if i m going out and catching you know six thirty train five minutes actually makes quite a difference in the middle of the night
1	mm yes mm mm
1	you know erm so anon nametype f type name always asks me what i want for christmas so i said well if you can find me a little you know so that it can go in a suitcase a little erm digital
1	mm
1	alarm clock and that s what she s buying me so she hasn t no i can t what else do you want so
1	mm see you know the light of a digital one also irritates me
1	mm hm
1	i unclear won t unclear wear it all the time erm so i it was an analogue on that i d got but i if its got luminous paint on the hands that s not enough to pause dur short jump out at you
1	that s what mine s like that s what mine that s what got mm
1	yes that s fine yeah erm but but an actual digital one it it actually glows and you can even if you turn it round you can still see the glow
1	oh right
1	erm
1	i don t think that ll put me off
1	but i don t i don t think that you can well i think you re right with an analogue one that you can t be that accurate with with the alarm unfortunately
1	mm no and as i say normally it really doesn t matter but it s just if i have early mornings and if i do the pause dur short i ve been offered erm erm pause dur short a course at the agricultural ministry in anon type place
1	mm
1	and they like to have it before work so that s eight o clock
1	mm
1	so i have to be there like quarter to eight so it means getting a half past six train more or less and and then you really don t want to be woken up ten minutes more than more than necessary
1	no no
1	yeah
1	mm pause dur short no pause dur short i i ve started using my mobile as an alarm and discovered by accident that you don t need to leave the clock you don t need to leave the phone on if you switch it off it still works as an alarm
1	oh right and anon nametype m type name uses when we re away
1	mm
1	he uses his his digital
1	and obviously you can set that to a precise minute
1	yeah his his phone as a as an alarm
1	and it s not okay you get this voice going the trunc ti trunc it s time to get up the time is seven twenty two
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it s time to get up the time is seven trunc thir trunc
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know
1	ah
1	the whatever you get it s some kind of noise vocal desc laugh
1	yeah we just set the
1	you could probably actually change what it does anyway i mean i haven t i haven t investigated that but if you can change the ringtone i would imagine you can change the alarm noise as well
1	and if you can and if you can turn your satnav to an australian an australian male instead of a instead of a british female pause dur short yeah
1	mm exactly so
1	er
1	anyway i mean if you re getting one from anon nametype f type name then it doesn t matter does it
1	yeah
1	but if if you don t get one i would investigate that
1	yeah oh yeah pause dur short she always wants to know in about october you know what do you want for christmas and i think i ve no idea and anon nametype m type name s useless but this year he did know what to ask her for because we ll we ve been watching lewis
1	oh right
1	and we obviously missed out a complete series pause dur short erm because we watch it on itv three i think it is and they re trunc lu trunc they re often repeats
1	right
1	but we ve obviously missed out erm a whole series so he said well he wanted series x of lewis
1	mm
1	so it was very easy to tell her
1	mm
1	she was she was like you know ecstatic that vocal desc laugh three days before christmas she knew what she was buying for anon nametype m type name vocal desc cough
1	help yourself
1	yep
1	yep
1	right yours ll be in the post vocal desc laugh pause dur short i hope it s rsvp pause dur short the card
1	it is yes
1	vocal desc laugh vocal desc cough
1	erm pause dur short well as i say i actually found some this year that said season s greetings vocal desc laugh and and that i really liked
1	and did you buy them from the from the meeting or did you get them online
1	i bought them from the meeting
1	mm
1	erm because you re not paying postage then
1	true
1	erm and in fact if you want something big she will get it for you and because she s getting a lot of stuff she s not paying postage so that doesn t then that doesn t the cost doesn t get passed onto the
1	right
1	customer so
1	mm
1	it just makes sense at any time if i want something from them to order it from her
1	and is the person who did the seed and stuff is she a member of the rspb
1	no er not as far as i know
1	mm
1	she s just a friend of anon nametype f type name who is the treasurer
1	oh i see
1	and the unclear
1	cos i mean it s quite a good idea but some people might get a bit you know well annoyed that you ve got some sort of commercial thing going on that s not rspb i don t i mean it wouldn t worry me
1	well well as i say we used to she used to do the actual the seed from the trunc rs trunc and and there s times of year when it goes and times of year when it doesn t and it s heavy and so on and she ended up stopping doing it and i think fair enough cos anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name really do an awful lot
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short but pause dur short then anon nametype f type name came along committee meeting before last and said her friend and it s all pause dur short well pause dur short she s got a shop in anon type place and it s sort of the equivalent of fair trade coffee but animal food if you see what i mean you know
1	okay yeah
1	so i think it s something that the rspb would approve of in other words
1	yeah
1	even though it s not actually their stuff pause dur long
1	mm
1	so we said well we ll give it a try
1	well when i was waiting for you for the meeting to start there were people behind me talking
1	mm
1	and saying oh this is a good idea cos they have big sacks and they can order and so obviously they were happy
1	mm
1	you know and i would imagine they were not the only ones
1	i don t know i can t remember what the what we trunc deci trunc whether we re actually getting anything from it or whether it s just pause dur short she s coming and we re providing her a venue i mean she s giving up an evening when she wouldn t normally be working
1	yeah yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur long but as i say if it s the people behind me were anything to go by people are really quite happy about it there was no question of why s she there or anything
1	well pause dur short you see the pause dur short yes okay the rspb sells stuff pause dur short but it sells stuff to make money for what it does pause dur short and it is a charity that that it i can t remember what the how what the timeframe is but they sort of said they ve only they only have so many months of reserves of money so
1	oh right
1	if if money doesn t keep coming in they don t sort of have lots of investments and things they the money that comes in gets used very quickly pause dur short erm pause dur short so yeah they need their commercial enterprises but they re not a commercial organisation what they re interested in is wildlife and if people are buying birdseed then they re preserving the birds for the next year so they shouldn t really have any problem with it i don t think
1	are you supposed to feed birds the whole year
1	mm
1	yeah
1	mm
1	i mean anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name do my dad used to too but i just didn t know whether you could leave off in the summer but
1	that is actually really a crucial time cos it s when they re feeding their young
1	oh right yeah
1	and they ve done trunc ex trunc erm pause dur short studies would be a better word than experiments erm cos sparrows the number of sparrows has gone down quite drastically
1	that s why my sister was so annoyed
1	yes
1	because when on the day there was the count there were no sparrows and the next day she said you know she had lots in her garden
1	well they d done studies of sparrows in urban settings where pause dur short they fed some of them on mealworms at the time that they were feeding the young and others not and it made a huge difference to how many broods were successfully raised
1	oh right uhu
1	erm which would suggest that we re just erm spraying all our flowers to get rid of the insects or something and they re not getting the protein at the time that they need it i don t know pause dur short erm pause dur short but for some reason
1	mm
1	they re not getting what they what they need pause dur short erm pause dur short and i had i mean the first last year pause dur short it was really noticeable i had some grey tits and some blue tits who both had but young which they were bringing unclear
1	in the trees right at the bottom
1	i don t know where the nest was
1	uhu
1	but they were coming to my feeder cos i put food out and for pause dur short a a couple of months i got nothing and i was quite disappointed i do get quite a lot of cats coming through erm and then suddenly when they d got the babies i d got a great tit coming with one day she d got two babies and she was coming and bringing them to the feeder then she got the food and was putting it in their mouths it was quite interesting to watch next day there were three and the next and then after that there were four so they were just fledging
1	yeah
1	erm and even after they d the the mum had stopped coming with them i was getting the four babies all you know for for quite a few weeks they knew this is where we can get food and and as far as i know all four survived you know at least
1	mm
1	er and blue tits i can t remember how many baby blue tits there were but i d actually learnt the to recognise the difference between adult and and a baby because they do look different
1	and unclear how unclear you recognise the call
1	well
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i learnt a great tits call cos it s a it s a quite an irritating sort of two tone squeak pause dur short erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i was sitting trunc o trunc outside going i wonder what that is and went and checked and yes that was definitely a great tit but i mean i can identify a few things but you go out on a guided walk with these blokes who are pause dur short the the chap sitting behind that guy anon nametype m type name with the beard who s doing the who does the
1	who you were talking who you were talking to
1	yes he s a warden at anon type place nature reserve which is just down in anon type place erm and you and i ve been and done erm what they call vis mig which is visible migration which is a time that everything s migrating you go and stand there s a couple of weeks where you just go out every night at duskish and and count how many things you see go over that s all he s unclear doing unclear
1	you don t have to say what it is
1	yes you do
1	oh
1	erm this is what i m saying he s going right i m unclear counting unclear twenty three redwing vocal desc laugh and two wood pigeon and i m going i can just about recognise a wood pigeon when it s flying but how the hell do you know that s a redwing they re just specs vocal desc laugh erm you know and so he can recognise the silhouettes like that which is pause dur short phenomenal er i mean even to the point of his saying okay there s twenty three redwings and there s a field fair in there as well and i m going they re they re both thrushes vocal desc laugh but and okay you know that there s a good chance that you might have a mixture of the two because that s what they do but even so how can you tell when they re up there against the sky
1	i don t know how you count either
1	well that was a i mean he was trying to teach us how to count and
1	you know i mean when you re when when you see on vocal desc cough on springwatch or autumnwatch and they re saying you know in this what do you call the swathe when they do all the beautiful patterns
1	erm pause dur short i know what you mean unclear flock i don t really know another word
1	erm and they say you know there are thirty thousand and i think well okay you know they re saying about thirty thousand but i don t know how you even say there are about thirty thousand
1	no
1	i wouldn t have a clue i just think there s lots of birds
1	yes erm i don t know how you count those sort of numbers cos we weren t seeing any anything like as big as that erm he was sort of pause dur short kind of doing it in tens or
1	mm
1	you know sort of well that s trunc twent trunc it it you can t be very accurate but also we were there were there were five or six of us standing there and everybody was coming up with a slightly different number
1	mm
1	and his wife sort of writing things down could you pass the butter please pause dur short erm pause dur short writing things down and and you know they kind of kind of go with an average if you ve got several people there
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but i just found it impossible i was standing there being interested but i really wasn t contributing to the counting because i just couldn t watch things moving about like that
1	i don t think i would be able to look up that long
1	well
1	i get dizzy
1	that s that is also a problem yes you get dizzy and you get backache
1	because trunc w trunc pause dur short because when i was painting our sitting room i was doing the ceiling and i i couldn t do it for long
1	mm
1	because because of looking up
1	yes yes well that s why i got anon nametype m type name to do my bedroom ceiling
1	vocal desc laugh
1	cos i thought i would just fall i trunc cou trunc i did the er coving in in pause dur short erm that room you know no problem so that s up a stepladder because you can hold the wall with your other hand
1	mm mm
1	but in the middle of the room no
1	no
1	erm
1	and i i was very glad i d finished it and i was okay cos a friend of mine s just cracked three ribs er not painting the kitchen but erm cleaning you know on top of cupboards and various things and she fell
1	mm oh dear
1	and er
1	that did you try that that s the quince
1	yes it s very good
1	you see i think it s too sweet
1	no i quite like it but then i am i have got a sweet tooth
1	well i have got a sweet tooth but i like jam to have flavour i don t like strawberry jam because it just doesn t it s too sweet and it doesn t really taste of very much
1	i don t like strawberry jam because when i was a kid i had a huge tablet and the doctors asked me to erm swallow this on strawberry jam
1	mm
1	if they d given me water i d have swallowed it happily but the strawberry jam i gagged on it and do you know for years i couldn t eat strawberry jam without gagging and of course grandma s always give you strawberry jam don t they
1	erm
1	when when you when you come to tea well with my grandma s
1	vocal desc laugh i don t know
1	when you go to tea you you got strawberry jam
1	mine gave me fish and chips i don t remember the strawberry jam vocal desc laugh
1	and and my mum was the sort of mum who said well you know they ve gone to a lot of trouble
1	yes
1	eat it
1	yes my mother would have vocal desc laugh
1	you know eat it but eat it just a little bit you know
1	yes
1	so i used to spread it very thinly but
1	unclear
1	i m okay now i can eat strawberry jam now but i don t enjoy strawberry jam that oh oh dear you you don t look as though you re gonna be able to walk
1	no damn it pause dur short this very i think it is just a great tit but i keep unclear getting unclear a bird which will insist on feeding on the opposite side of the unclear feeder unclear so i can t bloody identify it vocal desc laugh er and i oh i and i wondered if i got was getting a chaffinch because chaffinches are really common and i never get them here i never even see them in the trees
1	is there something they feed on that s not round here
1	i don t know erm i just i mean if you go for a walk you see lots and they do come to feeders when i was in scotland last year that was it was chaffinches and siskins which you don t get out unclear
1	siskins i wouldn t know at all
1	erm and and tits but i mean
1	and is that very similar to a chaffinch
1	it no but it it s a similar there are they re all a similar sort of you know small birds is what we re talking about no they re sort of greenish yellowish
1	mm no idea
1	erm pause dur short but again i haven t really seen them around here but i was sitting there with my bird book and and the same birds were coming every time you know
1	mm
1	that looks like a good unclear array of pills
1	yeah it is pause dur short one because i don t erm what what don t i have something i m something deficient
1	oh are you very deficient unclear dear unclear vocal desc laugh
1	mm pause dur long
1	if you re not full feel free to eat that erm
1	i m fine no
1	unclear well i m sorry pause dur short you re gonna have to wait for your coffee while i finish me bread vocal desc laugh pause dur long
1	i ve actually got to remember not to take aspirin as from monday
1	right
1	cos my i m having my teeth out
1	oh right oh
1	cos they re you know blood thinners
1	mm yeah i see what you mean cos i was trying to work out does aspirin react with anaesthetic or something but so you having two local anaesthetics on your teeth on different sides and you just won t be able to talk even would ya
1	no no pause dur short she said you know i d have i d look like a hamster for at least two days if not three
1	really
1	mm pause dur short yeah well this one this one is very loose so that will be an easy job just pull out
1	mm
1	but the top one it ll be a digging
1	oh dear
1	sort of
1	mm
1	yeah vocal desc cough but why i have to go off aspirin to have two teeth out i don t know when you have an operation i had my gallbladder out
1	mm
1	and i didn t have to stop trunc tak trunc
1	oh
1	i didn t have to stop taking aspirins so don t ask me
1	well
1	that was when i actually went to the cardiologist
1	mm
1	and they said go and talk to him
1	mm
1	we won t do it until you ve talked to the cardiologist and he tells us what you re supposed to do
1	mm
1	and he said no it s alright pause dur short so
1	well
1	vocal desc cough
1	possibly if you went and talked to the cardiologist he would say it doesn t matter pause dur short the dentist ll be covering her back won t she because that s what people do nowadays in case you sue her
1	yeah yeah of course
1	erm
1	yeah pause dur long i don t think germany s caught up quite as long as much as as england has with the suing
1	well
1	because i mean you don t have in you don t have in the on the television you don t have vocal desc cough adverts for you know we are doctors for you or whatever it is
1	mm
1	erm if you have a problem come and phone us and people think they don t you know no win no fee vocal desc laugh
1	mm pause dur short erm well i mean even if pause dur short she s not thinking quite like that i think pause dur short she s probably got regulations that that er err on the side of caution shall we say and she s not in a position to make the call really is she
1	no no no pause dur short i mean okay i can understand it s didn t don t really worry me but i just must remember to do it
1	mm
1	vocal desc cough pause dur long
1	on the other hand if it was okay for your gallbladder it probably will be if you don t remember just lie if she asks you a question
1	vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	so you re the one who s taking those tablets but anon nametype m type name s the one who s having nosebleeds
1	yeah
1	mm
1	he didn t have one the day after he went to the doctors and he they cauterised the erm one nostril
1	mm
1	erm so maybe it is just a weakness of the
1	mm
1	blood vessels in his nose or but he does blow hard when he blows his nose you really hear it through the whole flat
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm so i think he has to be a bit more gentle with himself
1	mm
1	he s got to go back pause dur short this coming thursday and then they ll think about it pause dur short anon nametype m type name thinks they ll the doctor ll think about it and then decide he has to have lots of appointments you know that ll do his bank balance balance good
1	mm
1	i don t think he ll i hope it doesn t happen before we go away
1	yeah pause dur long
1	vocal desc cough
1	mm yeah it was happening i remember pause dur short when it was happening with me pause dur short i was doing the lights for a play cos i can remember it starting and i was sitting in the box you know but it would just unclear start unclear no warning no nothing and you d just suddenly realise that you were trunc blee trunc and so you get blood on your clothes cos you don t realise what s happening until it s too late to stop it
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	but as i say i was lucky it just stopped again pause dur short so
1	mine just stopped i had them regularly when i was a child and i mean you know not vocal desc cough sort of ten minutes i was awake for an hour
1	mm
1	and then it would stop and then i would be asleep and it would start again
1	mm
1	i can remember mum putting ice cubes on my neck
1	yeah
1	to stop it and it was awful but and i don t know i must have been i don t know ten eleven and then it just stopped
1	mm well i went to the doctor when i was a kid a teenager i can t remember pause dur short to get advice because i was getting so many nosebleeds erm pause dur short and it actually came up on qi sort of what you do when you ve got a nosebleed and i knew the answer because i can remember at school the school nurse lying me down on my back after i and okay that nosebleed was cos someone had hit me across the face with a hockey stick vocal desc laugh during the middle i mean not intentionally
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm so fair enough erm and it s horrible like because you re swallowing the blood
1	i know
1	it makes you feel sick erm you know but that is not what you re supposed to do and in fact if you do if you do what you are supposed to do it usually does clear up fairly quickly but
1	and you get a huge great clot out of your nose
1	mm
1	that was a horrible bit of it as well
1	mm yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short no the last one i can remember having when i was young was pause dur short when i went to china with the british council and pause dur short my my luggage got taken off the well it everybody s luggage should have been taken off the plane in hong kong but everybody else had arrived in a bunch and sorted it and i arrived very early cos i travelled down overnight to catch this flight pause dur short so i d already checked in and i didn t realise that they d put together two two cheap tickets pause dur short and although it was the same plane pause dur short so the luggage could stay on vocal desc laugh erm it should have been taken off and put back on again and so mine was taken off and in hong kong i don t know now but in those days they didn t have announcements they had someone standing there with a little card with you name on which i didn t see so i arrived in the
1	in chinese
1	no no no in english
1	vocal desc laugh
1	in hong kong this is in the days when hong kong was was british erm pause dur short so i arrived in in beijing at sort of it was the end of august beginning of september beginning of september and it was very hot which of course isn t good for nosebleeds cos that thins your blood and then i got all the stress of am i going to get my luggage cos we d only got a day there and i was going onto my next place you know and i didn t have a lot of money with me because i didn t have a lot of money i d been a student for however many years vocal desc laugh erm so i woke up the first morning in beijing with blood all over the place and and of course you couldn t get any ice we were just stuck in this student accommodation pause dur short erm and there was tepid water and that was all there was there wasn t even cold water vocal desc laugh you ran the tap it didn t really come very cold
1	mm well anon nametype m type name actually wasn t very very enthusiastic when i said unclear well unclear ice cubes but er
1	but it works
1	mm
1	and i put i just pause dur short get a really cold keep getting the flannel cold and if you hold that across here actually that usually brings the temperature down and if you don t really have to do ice but you certainly need cold pause dur short right pause dur short coffee
1	yes please pause dur long
1	ah
1	with with milk please
1	oh right pause dur short it s a good job you said that cos i think i just tend to assume that people are gonna unclear be unclear black i don t know
1	i assume nobody ever takes sugar in coffee cos i don t vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh well actually i i probably would have asked because workmen pause dur short usually have milk and sugar and i ve had quite a few workmen in this trunc hou trunc house over the last few years so
1	yeah
1	yes that s definitely a great tit that i m seeing now
1	it s it s behaving itself now is it
1	yes
1	it s looking into the camera watch the birdie pause dur short erm
1	well i ve got some the thing that i ve got in a squirrel proof thing is sunflower kernels and they really go for those and they always go in the far side unclear where i hang it but pause dur short that s that thing in a cage but it would even when it see they come from that tree
1	oh yeah
1	seems so many it s very difficult to see what it is when it does that
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur long are they really squirrel proof
1	erm pause dur short i think so i mean i have got a squirrel proof one for peanuts as well but pause dur short last year i had a woodpecker come into the peanuts and obviously that couldn t get through those little holes so this year i thought right i ll leave that one out rather than the squirrel proof one but i haven t seen a woodpecker so pause dur short er unclear and unclear i don t particularly want to encourage squirrels
1	did you ever come to our house in anon type place
1	yes twice
1	oh of course you did cos you helped put up the the famous tent
1	yes
1	well we had a we used to have erm a woodpecker there
1	right
1	used to come
1	well they re just so was that is that pause dur short a red spotted you know the unclear
1	mm yeah
1	cos they re so spectacular aren t they
1	yeah very very
1	the first time i saw one what is that wow it would come more or less the same time every day
1	yeah
1	for several weeks
1	and the other bird we had in our garden was jays
1	yes
1	they re spectacular too
1	yeah i know i have had those this year i ve had a pair er actually coming to the feeders which is quite unusual cos they re quite shy
1	yeah
1	i sort of switch it from one to the other you go and sit down i ll bring it in pause dur short oh and that that rose is looking a bit pathetic i i pruned me roses back and some of them still have blossom on so i that one had a few buds on and i thought they might come out but they didn t vocal desc laugh
1	i m just hoping our roses survive the winter cos they ve got this i don t know what it i don t know what it s called in english any more but it s erm it s a fungal disease and i knew as i told you you have to spray
1	yeah yeah
1	but they said and you must rake up all the leaves
1	yeah
1	because they because it s a fungus that will survive frost
1	right
1	erm so i did and of course we mulch them
1	yep
1	so erm i couldn t separate the mulch stuff and the leaves and i had to rake everything up
1	mm
1	and whether i got it all i don t know but i just hope so because you know they re new and they re just getting established and i don t want to start again can you if they did die
1	yeah
1	i m wondering whether i then couldn t put roses there and that would be really a mess because we we ve as the garden is so organised
1	yes
1	that this is this is the rose bed with the lavender round the edge
1	yeah yeah
1	and you know it d be really unclear problem
1	oh what i mean the question would be whether the whether the the mildew had erm pause dur short sort of established itself in the soil i suppose see my dad had that with he used to grow cabbages and sprouts and cauliflowers and he got i can t remember what it s called but something that affects brassica and he just decided he had to abandon that bed i mean he put something else in it but he couldn t grow those things there any more
1	ah ha
1	erm so i m sorry that s not very trunc en trunc trunc en trunc encouraging is it but i don t pause dur short i would have thought if they died that that would be because pause dur short well i don t know you ll see what happens next year if they come up next year and they re looking unhappy that means you haven t managed to get rid of it doesn t it
1	yep and the then they say if you haven t got rid of it you can you can they spray them again but you must have a different spray
1	right
1	so i mean i had
1	sorry you said
1	i wouldn t i wouldn t despair immediately but
1	you said yes to milk yeah
1	yes please
1	cos right okay sorry you just said with a little bit too much coffee in there vocal desc laugh so that i can t fit the milk in pause dur short ah right pause dur long unclear ah unclear
1	yeah
1	erm
1	what s the matter
1	is that enough milk sorry i ve got it very full
1	no i d rather have a bit more please
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short unclear i m thinking i m not sure right okay unclear
1	shall i come and slurp it
1	i was gonna say if i put more milk in there you re not going to be able to carry it are you do you want to do it yourself and then pause dur short that is the problem with making the coffee directly into the mug you can t quite see what s happening until you lift the filter up oh i misjudged it pause dur short oh
1	you re not going to be able to go for a walk
1	i don t i really don t think i am no i m sorry but if i d had the experience of going for a walk actually makes it better then i would say yes but actually going for a walk seems to make it worse so
1	mm
1	i would just have thought it would loosen it up and and help but it wouldn t seem to
1	well we ll chat and then i ll ring i ll ring anon nametype f type name
1	yeah
1	and say hello did you have a good day yesterday and then i ll tootle off
1	well if you want to ring her on my landline
1	okay
1	erm i ve got a a package so it doesn t make any difference
1	oh right vocal desc misc she doesn t like erm talking on the phone very much but when i when i phoned her on monday she was actually quite chatty
1	right
1	for her
1	mm just unfortunately vocal desc laugh saying oh i d forgotten all about you vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	so does she realise or did you manage not to let her realise that that she s forgotten something
1	no i i i said you know i didn t say is everything okay for friday i just said because i was going to be there i d like to come and see you on friday
1	ah right
1	and she said oh no it s not possible pause dur short you know and i m glad i did it that way
1	yeah
1	cos otherwise she would have felt
1	yes yes
1	erm mortified vocal desc misc but these trunc pe trunc people who who she went out with i didn t want to say well you know i d come all the way from germany and flown especially to manchester
1	yeah
1	to see her they look after her a lot i mean
1	right
1	they take her out they ll take her to the seaside and they ll just sit her in a deck chair and she enjoys being by the seaside and
1	oh right
1	and they erm i mean when dad died they brought her up to the funeral and erm you know they look after her it s not they re not there sort of every day or anything
1	no but still yeah that s
1	but they do they do look after her and i mean anon nametype f type name was there in oh september

1	right
1	and so anon nametype f type name and i feel we don t want to abandon her completely
1	mm
1	and she s she really does enjoy having visits i mean she talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about pause dur short n about nothing really and about what she s been doing
1	yes yeah
1	is exactly the same as what she s been doing when you saw her the trunc nex trunc the time before but but she s lovely company she s never says you know i wish i d seen you more often and trunc whatev trunc
1	mm yeah
1	she never complains about anything and she s just a happy person
1	right
1	you know she she never moans about things at all and she s a joy to be with
1	well that probably makes a difference to er the people who pause dur short look after well not look after but you know what i mean
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	the the erm that s much more rewarding isn t it
1	yeah
1	well i go er from time to time since i moved from the other house i ve been back to see anon nametype f type name who s the woman in the the house that backed onto mine
1	okay
1	erm and it was anon nametype f type name and anon nametype m type name when i moved in and he got parkinson s pause dur short erm cos he used to sit out in the garden but she she told me about it partly because they were they i can t remember what pause dur short what the boundary was between us whether it was a fence or what but she had it turned into a wall and the and the back garden sort of paved because he did the garden and he couldn t cope any more but she wanted somewhere a bit more manageable so we had a whole conversation about that but she was the sort of person that if you if you went out and hung your washing out you got caught for half an hour
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and she had a very loud voice and i was always conscious that the whole neighbourhood could hear the conversation
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but very kind and pause dur short things like when i was away on holiday she would know i was on holiday because my bathroom window wasn t ever open
1	right
1	yeah pause dur short erm my mum and my brother went round to check on the garden and she didn t see my mum she only saw this strange man in my garden and she went and stood in her garden so that he d know he was being watched
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and then my mum came round the trunc corne trunc and she realised who he must be you know but but you know
1	yeah
1	that s the sort of neighbour you need really unclear
1	yeah yeah yeah vocal desc laugh
1	erm so i made a point of of going back pause dur short not very often unclear
1	trunc i trunc is she a widow now
1	so she s a widow now he died vocal desc misc probably about three years ago but they d been married for fifty seven years
1	mm
1	they d sort of been childhood sweethearts always lived in the area only moved about three streets but they haven t got kids so although she s got a nephew a nephew and a niece i think possibly more than you know she s certainly got a sister who s in the area erm it s not the same thing as actually having your own children who might call and so on
1	mm
1	and and she talks and talks and talks vocal desc laugh from the second you set foot in the door
1	yep yeah
1	and she s lonely
1	yep
1	and it s so sad when she is when she is such a gregarious person
1	mm i mean anon nametype f type name vocal desc cough she reminisces like all old people do
1	mm
1	but she and anon nametype m type name were the sort of people that just enjoyed life
1	mm
1	he he was a boilermaker and i mean didn t earn that much money but they were very thrifty
1	mm
1	and then they d say and now we re going on the qe two
1	mm
1	you know and erm they they had a i don t know it was a concorde flight from pause dur short bristol to don t know where and then then you got on the qe two and you went it wasn t a huge great cruise
1	mm
1	but the could say they ve been on the qe two
1	yeah yeah
1	and she says she s so happy that she did that because now she can remember it cos anon nametype m type name died pause dur short oh again about three years ago but it was merciful that he died he had throat cancer
1	mm
1	and he died before it got dreadful and he couldn t speak and swallow and
1	see this is
1	you know so it was a mercy and and i think she she realised that the only thing that anon nametype f type name and i were were really pause dur short quite angry about i didn t go to the funeral because erm anon nametype f type name said no don t don t come unclear you know
1	we ll it s a long way to come isn t it yeah
1	but anon nametype f type name went and took mum and she said these two friends of anon nametype f type name s more or less took over
1	mm
1	and there was anon nametype f type name there sort of almost lost at her husband s funeral and that annoyed anon nametype f type name she said you know you trunc le trunc you let her grieve and do what she she wants to do
1	yeah
1	rather than pause dur short mm but i don t know push her about somehow
1	mm
1	erm so anon nametype f type name was quite angry about that but otherwise erm she she got through it and pause dur short has she s managed very very much since but she went into this erm this sheltered accommodation because even when anon nametype m type name was alive they were living in a bungalow and they had burglars who got in and robbed them while they were asleep in the bedroom
1	oh that s not nice is it
1	and so she when he died she was just far too nervous to live on her own there
1	mm
1	and that s why she went into to to erm sheltered accommodation not really because she was forced to
1	mm
1	erm and it it wasn t a huge she wouldn t have really been rattling around in the trunc fl trunc in the bungalow
1	mm but yeah
1	but er she just felt she couldn t
1	oh i can understand yes i think that would be very
1	vocal desc cough
1	yeah no my the the my colleague anon nametype f type name i think i said her partner died about four years ago
1	mm
1	and that was i think it s cancer of the oesophagus or something i mean it was that sort of thing cos the first we knew about it was he rang her at work and at that point she and i shared a phone
1	right
1	she wasn t in the office so i picked up erm and i almost thought it was a joke because his voice was so sort of hoarse and funny erm and pause dur short i can t remember the he he d never rung up before so i didn t actually know what his voice sounded like you know erm but but pause dur short he was ringing something to do with a hospital appointment so she sort of which was why he d rung which he wouldn t normally have done when she was at work and and er so she sort of told me a little bit but at that point pause dur short vocal desc misc i m not even sure he d been diagnosed but it was really really fast you know they d been he d had a bit of a sore throat when they went on holiday and then when and it didn t get any better while he was on holiday so eventually he went to the doctor and and sort of three months later he was dead it was that sort of thing but it is horrible at the end she said he just he was just almost like a skeleton like because he couldn t swallow
1	mm mm
1	erm lying on the bed and he was nursed at home
1	i mean she didn t let did she
1	well she was there but no they had somebody they had somebody coming in erm
1	yeah yeah
1	sort of i don t think permanently but maybe twice a day or something like that
1	mm
1	and she was looking after him in between
1	mm mm
1	erm but i don t know how old how old he was i probably did ask her at the time she s a couple of years older than me so at that point she might have been trunc fif trunc i think she had already turned fifty
1	mm
1	but she was either fifty or fifty one now pause dur short they hadn t it it wasn t one of those relationships where they d sort of met when they were twenty because he had a daughter by somebody else a grown up daughter by somebody else
1	mm
1	erm he was austrian and i think they d met when she was working in the czech republic pause dur short so pause dur short but they d certainly been together you know ten or fifteen years
1	mm
1	erm and and seemed to have well as you and anon nametype m type name do a very pause dur short a relationship that really works between two intelligent adults who know what they need and know what they want do you know what i mean
1	mm yeah yeah
1	erm pause dur long so pause dur short i think but she was so difficult to help because she s a really reserved person she s not the sort of person you can put your arm round you don t she doesn t touch you she doesn t touch people
1	mm that s hard yeah
1	and we were all saying we don t know what to do vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	erm it s quite unusual i mean if it was a man you might get that feeling although a lot of men are much more touchy feely than they than they like to let on aren t they but i mean my brother s a right total softy and always has been vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	but er
1	did did you know anon nametype f type name i mean when you were working in the trunc clini trunc in the council anon nametype f type name yeah
1	mm yeah anon nametype f type name yeah
1	cos she s very very private she s had a bad summer cos she s been suffering from depression
1	mm
1	and she s not trunc s trunc you can put your arm round her you can give her a hug but you can t get her out anywhere
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	erm you know i had anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name round did you know them
1	yes
1	anon nametype m type name and his partner anon nametype m type name
1	yep i didn t really know anon nametype m type name but i unclear
1	no i i didn t i didn t know anon nametype m type name that well
1	i knew of him obviously but i m not sure i ever actually met him
1	no well anyway there was anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	who came round to supper last week
1	oh

1	yeah vocal desc laugh old times
1	old times at the anon type place and she said er well no i mean i didn t think she would
1	oh dear
1	but i thought for them she would sort of make the effort
1	yeah
1	because they know her and love her and have known her for a long time and erm and she said afterwards she said i m very sorry you know and i m a misery and i don t come out and i said well you cope with you know for you home sweet home is home
1	yeah
1	and you you feel the need to be at home and safe in your home and that s fine i don t feel i don t feel upset or offended that you re not coming to supper
1	mm
1	it s just i thought you would enjoy it
1	yeah
1	and you she you i know that you can t just say well you know snap out of it because it s not you know
1	it s not like that
1	she s ill
1	yeah
1	she s ill and
1	but i would have thought that being with a small group of people that she knew well would actually have been okay so that s not good really is it
1	yeah she so she won t erm
1	mm
1	she sort of crawls into pause dur short into her little flat which is gorgeous erm i mean and she s very happy there
1	mm
1	and she s quite happy mooching about and she plays bridge online and that s her big thing is plays bridge online
1	right pause dur short oh right
1	but i just thought as you say for people a very small
1	yeah
1	group that she knew very well
1	yes
1	erm and then of course i saw her at bmw i had lunch with her last wednesday and she said did you have a good evening
1	mm
1	and i i didn t say yes you d have loved it
1	no but
1	i just said yes and
1	right
1	erm anon nametype m type name was very touched because he knew anon nametype m type name and anon nametype m type name s a real touchy feely
1	yeah
1	so he got a hug anon nametype m type name got a hug from anon nametype m type name
1	right wow
1	when we arrived and anon nametype f type name did of course
1	yes
1	but anon nametype m type name shook his hand
1	right vocal desc laugh
1	and at the end he got a hug
1	oh right so he obviously passed the test there unclear somehow unclear
1	so yes yes yes so it was it was
1	well it s a it s a pause dur short what do i mean it s a bit like the unclear doozy unclear thing
1	yeah
1	whether you hug a man or not isn t it
1	yes
1	because you never know whether you re male or female you never quite know how he s going to feel about with a woman you can usually judge fairly well
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but men are difficult
1	mm yeah
1	yeah
1	no but but anon nametype m type name was anon nametype m type name was very happy about that
1	yeah vocal desc laugh
1	and and in fact we both of us got to know anon nametype m type name a lot better
1	trunc a trunc as i say it obviously cos anon nametype m type name talks about unclear i can remember erm pause dur short when oh some bloke pause dur short from the embassy called the british council and i can t remember what it was about now unclear was unclear some member of the royal family coming or something i i don t know
1	it wasn t it wasn t when prince charles was opening the new

1	and the bloke said something about german women and we were all sniggering vocal desc laugh he didn t say he didn t say actually it s not german women vocal desc laugh

0	and me and anon nametype m type name have got the fizzy drink and we are the only ones that ate our chicken so either the drink or the chicken ruined us it was not a joke it didn t last very long anon nametype f type name pause dur short it went it came straight out

0	oh fucking hell wait when do we get the next student grant

0	i cannot wait until i don t have to do unclear boy unclear stuff but then again i have to work two days a week pause dur short and it s just cheaper to just do the whole week
0	how early did you leave your house
0	i nearly said eleven i can t do it eleven is still the bloody morning vocal desc laugh er but we went to anon type place erm we were so hungry and thirsty we were already queuing but we didn t want to leave
0	yeah
0	so we called them pipes because it is like something random
0	oh okay yeah
0	yeah
0	and like the one behind us she was from like newcastle i think because my friend anon nametype f type name is from newcastle as well
0	so like as i said she was just like because she was talking to her and her boyfriend s mum on the phone
0	and then the one the ones in front of us they were like posh like she had that annoying voice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and we was going to trunc mi trunc like it was we would have missed it and pause dur short and i hate missing the beginning
0	yeah
0	plus it was going to be full so it was er pause dur short valentine s day and it was evening it was like nine thirty
1	okay anon nametype m type name we ve trying to learn spanish now for
1	how long ago do you think how long
1	well it s over ten years isn t it
1	really i don t really i know it s not a consistent thing we ve done is it you have more than me but it s it i don t really seem to be any further forward
1	well i m sure we are a little but then
1	don t think i am
1	we first started erm going to spanish classes when we were going to go to argentina for a holiday
1	and that was two thousand and five wasn t it
1	two thousand and three
1	wasn t it so it s over ten years
1	mm pause dur short yeah it s over ten years
1	oh
1	mm pause dur short but of the different ways because we started off with erm evening classes
1	yeah
1	and then we ve done things like listen to cassettes and the michel thomas cds
1	i had those michel thomas things where you
1	yeah
1	just had to trunc list trunc er listen to some trunc w trunc text listen to some words with baroque music playing in the background
1	oh that was ridiculous wasn t it yeah
1	not try and actually make any attempt to actually remember it
1	yes
1	but just supposedly you were meant to walk wake up in the morning
1	and it was there vocal desc laugh
1	and you just knew it
1	yes
1	you were just like a native
1	and do you remember that tape you had where the erm they said it they read something out in a normal voice and there was a whispering voice as well
1	no i don t remember that pause dur short was another idea was it
1	it s the it was another idea it sort of played the music and it trunc shel trunc it told the story of erm of adele and peter and unclear yeah
1	oh i remember adele and peter yes
1	and in guadalajara in mexico
1	i do remember it very well
1	and then you had a track where it just played the music and somebody was whispering in the background
1	yes i do i do remember it
1	the spanish and that trunc w trunc the idea of that was that it would stick in your mind but
1	yeah
1	i m not sure
1	yeah well it certainly i their names have stuck in my mind i remember their names
1	vocal desc laugh
1	what they said
1	mm
1	trunc r trunc i really have no idea
1	no
1	they were quite fond peter was quite fond of adele i remember
1	yes he he did quite fancy her didn t he
1	yeah i think in in the end he
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	that s all he really cared about was
1	yes
1	getting off with adele more than learning spanish i feel
1	mm pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	although he probably had to do one to achieve the other
1	i think he already spoke spanish
1	did he
1	yes
1	he just pretended he didn t
1	no no i think you re getting two things mixed up vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you re getting the michel thomas cds mixed up with the peter and adele story
1	yeah pause dur short you always have one person who gets it right in those things and one person who s a who s a bit of a duffer
1	mm pause dur short yes pause dur short one one gets it right and one gets it wrong yeah yeah pause dur short but trunc u trunc trunc t trunc erm going to classes do you you only really did that one that we did with erm anon nametype f type name in anon type place didn t you
1	anon type place yeah
1	i ve done some additional ones i took
1	you went to the erm institute didn t you in anon type place
1	yeah pause dur short but i also did another night class in anon type place pause dur short erm
1	i don t remember that
1	well you didn t go pause dur short i went on my own
1	where was it
1	in in er anon type place school
1	oh
1	but she was hopeless that teacher pause dur short a really really bad teacher
1	okay
1	yeah
1	blame the teacher
1	well i do blame the teacher vocal desc laugh it s trunc u trunc because in a in a in an evening class of two hours erm we hardly spoke pause dur short the trunc e trunc the only time we ever spoke was to read you know she might say anon nametype f type name will you read out number three you know and i would read out number three and then you know anon nametype f type name will you read out number four
1	it s no good is it it s really no good
1	we we didn t ever speak in any spanish and the teacher spoke english erm trunc b trunc a good ninety per cent of the time so everything she did was in english and although i think when you re learning the basics you need to learn in your your own language but you know they need to be rehearsing the the language that you know so pause dur short i i trunc d trunc was very disappointed with that teacher
1	you do pause dur short i mean some people are obviously far better than others at learning languages
1	mm
1	and we do all know the optimum way to learn it is to learn it when you re young and you know you you you you unclear and so
1	yeah but you can t be young if you re not young can you
1	but i mean
1	mm
1	we ve actually tried different methods of learning pause dur short er obviously you ve gotta learn the grammar but then you you know you probably gotta be around people where spanish is spoken
1	mm
1	otherwise you just don t really have the trunc ge trunc have the confidence to to carry on with it or the you know the
1	mm and trunc al trunc it always gets better when we go on holiday to spain doesn t it so trunc i trunc if we have a week in spain by the end of the week you know we know more we feel more confident we recognise more yeah
1	erm when we went to anon type place i was i remember speaking to people not not you know but really trying and
1	mm
1	really feel slightly i was getting somewhere
1	yes
1	but i don t seem to have carried on with i mean that s totally my own fault
1	mm
1	but it just seems a bit unachievable to me so and the older i get i trunc d trunc i don t mind you know we both say we can look at a new a fairly er you know a newspaper or certainly a comic and understand most of the you know of what it s on about
1	mm mm
1	but do i actually having to be able to trunc d trunc to speak it erm you can ask questions at people but to actually hold a conversation with people just personally seems to be a bit beyond me apart from
1	mm i think we could trunc r trunc
1	very basic things
1	mm yes i mean i do think we could get there and you start with the basics don t you so you go into shops and order stuff and you you know can ask for a meal and you can even you know elaborate on what you do and don t want and complain and book hotel rooms pause dur short so it all starts from there really doesn t it and then you build it up
1	i can t get away from the fact that you sort of have an english phrase and you sort of translate it literally from the english words
1	mm
1	and and you know it might not really make any sense
1	well it won t will it
1	you can t actually obviously don t know it it s
1	yeah
1	an obvious fact
1	yes mm
1	but the fact is you have to totally you know trunc o trunc for the most part
1	mm mm
1	you have to learn a whole new way of trunc sa trunc not only
1	yeah
1	different
1	yeah
1	words you have trunc whol trunc er er learn a whole new way of saying things
1	camisa negra foreign you don t think anything of that you don t think oh why am i saying shirt black instead of black shirt
1	no
1	do you you just accept it so it s it s only an extension of that that you naturally need to let your brain develop these different patterns
1	i mean it s obvious that we ve if we were really serious about it we ve got to at least have a lot of trunc y trunc tape recordings of you know constantly
1	mm mm
1	whether you re answering them back or not that would be better obviously
1	yeah
1	but at least have you know the spanish language playing in your ear to actually get used to the speed of it
1	i think so yeah pause dur short yeah
1	and and because you just hear i hear spanish people speak now and you know sometimes unless you know you might be trunc go trunc a number or a colour or a name basically i can t really understand anything they ve said
1	no but trunc u trunc we ve had this conversation before haven t we that does get better
1	mm
1	you you might not understand what they re saying but erm you need to be able to recognise where the words are starting and ending and stuff like that which when you don t understand anything it s just a a stream of gibberish pause dur short so if we heard a japanese person speaking you know we wouldn t recognise anything at all would we not even the pauses in between sentences
1	no
1	but with spanish we should be at least identifying occasional words
1	unclear like those unclear
1	and getting used to the patterns of where they stop and start
1	no trunc y trunc yeah
1	i mean i think that does get better definitely
1	well it must do hopefully you know if you trunc k trunc if you persist with it pause dur short i mean it we always used to laugh about them we ve said it so often but er the fact was that we both neither of us we both took french for four or five trunc n trunc i was never particularly good at learning french i again was
1	mm
1	okay with the with trunc th trunc trunc th trunc the the to write it down but no good at speaking it pause dur short but as soon as you try and learn spanish words all this french comes into your head
1	yeah it s very funny that isn t it yeah yes
1	well it s really really odd
1	yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short but i ve trunc t trunc
1	unclear i mean unclear
1	i ve heard that so many times
1	yeah
1	since from other people about other languages yeah
1	but it s it s a saying it s a it s a truism isn t it
1	yeah but it just shows you that your brain is able to sort of switch throw a switch between languages so it s got a
1	unclear
1	english language and then at the moment it s got everything else hasn t it so
1	we shouldn t we can be the wrong switch though
1	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh
1	no idea
1	i was talking to a girl a couple of weeks ago who speaks four or five different languages
1	i can t imagine how people can do that
1	well two of them she was she was raised with but with bilingual parents pause dur short and i can t remember what the languages were but let s say she spoke german and italian from being a child pause dur short and and then she additionally was er in anon type place to learn or to improve her english pause dur short and er she also spoke french which she was doing at school pause dur short erm and i said that to her about trunc d trunc you know doesn t it become a jumble and she said yeah it does sometimes that you know when she s searching for the right word you know and she can t think of the right word you know in any language so her brain ll throw up whatever it can think of pause dur short and also anon nametype m type name who er obviously is very good in english now pause dur short at i mean trunc adv trunc advanced level english pause dur short and speaks the the two variations of spanish both erm catalan and castilian
1	does he
1	oh yeah cos he s
1	what
1	he s from anon type place so his
1	yeah i know that
1	his first language is
1	well why would he speak castilian then
1	well it s it s because catalan is the minority language
1	mm
1	and castilian is sort of like the official spanish language pause dur short so all people who live in catalonia erm you know the the same as people live in the basque country speak in basque you know they all speak their first language catalonian basque whatever pause dur short and then additionally they ll speak castilian because that s the language of the government and the you know all that and
1	and yeah i mean i suppose it s unclear coherent but unclear
1	but he says that sometimes when he speaks to his mum on the phone erm he can t remember the word in trunc th trunc you know he he he s he ll remember the english word for something it would need to be an obscure word
1	mm yeah yeah
1	you know but he can t remember the right word in in erm catalan or castilian but he can sometimes remember it in english you know so that s a weird thing isn t it
1	mm it is pause dur short it is pause dur short no i didn t know and i did you know i m not sure it really applies someone like anon nametype m type name s dad or trunc d trunc anon nametype m type name s mum or mum and dad
1	mm mm
1	if they really are catalan speakers i m not sure they can all speak castilian you know but i suppose a lot of them can especially
1	yeah
1	the younger ones it they would
1	yeah
1	i don t mean
1	mm mm
1	i don t i don t think that pause dur short you know you say that all dutch people speak english pause dur short if you ever meet any old dutch people they don t speak english
1	okay so let s take a an example nearer to home then if you go to ireland
1	mm mm
1	erm the the you could probably find a trunc f trunc a handful of people who only speak gaelic and don t speak english
1	mm
1	but everybody else that lives there all the four million people or whatever who live in ireland who speak gaelic and not all of them do but the ones who do speak gaelic also speak english
1	that s true but a lot of them only speak well as you say there s not many gaelic speakers alone but there ll be a lot of people who don t have don t speak gaelic at all
1	yeah but the but it s it s trunc n trunc it s not that you know it i mean it s
1	mm
1	i dunno what the proportions are i don t know the numbers pause dur short alright what about even nearer to home wales
1	yeah well it s it s only
1	they re all taught it trunc t trunc in schools welsh
1	trunc y trunc trunc y trunc they they are but they stopped trunc t trunc teaching it for a trunc g trunc for a for a number of years pause dur short and so one time there s still a lot of you know trunc p trunc people who never learnt it all really
1	no but we re not saying trunc th trunc trunc y trunc trunc or trunc you re tackling this from the wrong way round pause dur short we re saying that people who know the minority language would also know the majority language
1	mm
1	so in the case of catalonia
1	mm
1	catalonians would also know spanish
1	mm
1	you know trunc m trunc gaelic speakers would also know english pause dur short welsh speakers would also know english pause dur short you were saying that it you thought in catalonia that you would get people who only spoke catalonian you know and didn t speak spanish and that that would be a sizeable proportion
1	i would ve still thought there would be fair number of people
1	well you ll have to google it cos i think you re wrong
1	yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short i mean how different are they
1	erm
1	does it say
1	they re trunc n trunc they re not trunc th trunc they they are different
1	mm
1	but they are there are a lot of similarities
1	mm
1	and often he ll tell me a word he ll say this is erm trunc u trunc the word for this is so and so and then he ll say oh trunc s trunc hang on a minute no that s the catalan word the spanish word is pause dur short and it and it ll be something similar yeah
1	but the basque language was really totally different
1	basque is completely different
1	yeah
1	yeah they
1	i mean
1	well we trunc kn trunc we we
1	you know just look totally different a load of what was it a load of ks
1	ks and xs and yeah
1	a load of ks load of xs yeah
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	and and er the place we stayed in started
1	mm
1	started trunc w trunc and ended with z
1	yeah
1	you know you just
1	which was place was that with a z
1	anon type place we stayed in
1	it didn t start with a z did oh trunc d trunc oh it did didn t it
1	yeah
1	yeah yes
1	started and ended
1	yeah
1	with a z
1	yeah pause dur short well pause dur short no that was a weird place wasn t it
1	mm mm
1	they they trunc th trunc trunc th trunc they told us that the language was unrelated to anything else wasn t it
1	think they say it was the trunc condi trunc they found some roots in what was it polish or
1	some somewhere
1	but trunc u trunc it s trunc som trunc somewhere completely different
1	yeah
1	not
1	yeah
1	not not mediterranean at all
1	no that would be worth having a look for actually
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	yeah
1	trunc tud trunc
1	but no but i suppose we just have to keep on don t we really just i mean look we trunc d trunc i don t look at my notes i don t practice enough you know i we said we were trunc i trunc well i said we were gonna have a song a week
1	a song a week
1	every week we d have a a spanish song and we d have the lyrics and we d practice and we didn t even do it once did we and i type things into a i ve got a program called anki which is for erm vocabulary pause dur short and for trunc s trunc enthusiastically i typed you know for several week but i didn t i stopped doing that pause dur short i think it s quite difficult to to persevere really and we can t we haven t even got the excuse that we haven t got time
1	i have no excuses at all
1	vocal desc laugh
1	once every trunc f trunc er once every month or so and really quite much more regularly than that lately i ve been thinking well i i need some sort of project pause dur short and i can t really think you know i don t really like making corn dollies so i i er i thought i ll learn spanish
1	well and now you re thinking that corn dollies might be quite a trunc ni trunc vocal desc laugh
1	i m thinking of going into corn dolly work now actually pause dur short i think it better i ve just gotta go and go and get myself some corn
1	yeah
1	got a big batch arriving tomorrow
1	vocal desc laugh pause dur short you could erm make some model aeroplanes
1	why am i er why trunc c trunc model trunc e trunc let me make some dollies pause dur short anyway no i ve been telling myself come on learn spanish pause dur short but i can t get down to it
1	mm
1	and i m not a particularly you know i like reading pause dur short er you know i trunc c trunc i don t want to just but i i find it very hard to trunc g trunc
1	yeah
1	actually think when i i i just bothers me somewhat about pause dur short i m just gonna forget this or i m not really gonna use it
1	mm
1	i know i know there s you know trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc the the prizes the benefit is of of is just learning pause dur short and knowing you ve achieved it if if if you can do it
1	oh absolutely yeah
1	i know that trunc i trunc it s the the the sense of accomplishment is is the trunc m trunc is the major thing pause dur short but i can t imagine myself getting to that point i think pause dur short it s almost you know we trunc d trunc all know that we d love to play a musical instrument pause dur short we will know how beneficial it would be pause dur short but really we know how difficult it is trunc espec trunc you know for us anyway
1	mm
1	and we re not like this in everything we re quite good i m quite good at trunc s trunc crosswords and things like this which you you which i improve at pause dur short but when i ve tried to learn a musical instrument i i trunc b trunc i trunc d trunc don t feel any improvement how ever hard i try
1	mm
1	every time i pick up the guitar or what have you it s like the first time i ever picked it up
1	yeah
1	you know i ve seen some people try and learn gold and and and they re just utterly useless
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and they play for a time and they might miss it less less often than they used to pause dur short but this you know they don t really ever really
1	mm mm
1	go anywhere pause dur short it s the older people young trunc one trunc
1	yeah
1	young ones
1	mm mm
1	always
1	yeah
1	pick it up to a degree
1	mm mm pause dur short but i trunc st trunc i still think it s worth persevering with the spanish maybe in september we ought to join another night class
1	ah dear just you you gonna you had a unclear site unclear pause dur short i don t what what trunc the trunc how it worked if it you know whether i said something and it said it back to me or trunc ha trunc you said it was quite a good site is this the one you ve already been talking about
1	no that s a program anki pause dur short the site is
1	is that the one that anon nametype m type name was on about
1	no that s something else pause dur short erm
1	the the who a friend of his used to work on it or something
1	yes that s that s called readlang which
1	yeah
1	is a it s well actually it s quite good because trunc i trunc trunc i trunc if you install it it enables you to click on any spanish and up pops the translation
1	oh well yeah there s
1	yeah
1	quite a few of those i think some are better than others obviously
1	camisa negra foreign
1	okay yeah yeah
1	and so it it helps by recycling them so it s that is probably quite
1	mm
1	worth having a look at pause dur short but the one i was going to show you was just the bbc s erm spanish learning site have you seen that
1	mm mm pause dur short no i don t think i have
1	okay well we ll have a look at that this afternoon if you like
1	okay
1	yeah

0	i honestly couldn t bear it it was awful there s nothing you can do really once it s burned they just have to
0	really
0	er he looked to me like he was in his mid forties
0	or i think he s got some involvement in the government he did have cos in that book at the start he says erm out of respect for the secret service it says patterns and er plans at the white house had been changed
0	i mean i it was from his books that when i was when i was kid and i was really into like military stuff you know
0	that was when your dad looked at you and was like that s my boy
0	a a wuss yeah before i became a literary wuss erm pause dur short you know i think i read a lot of books to make my dad like you know proud
0	like not proud but like pause dur short you know you wanna

0	she unclear
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i am pilgrim
0	erm pause dur short but it at first i was like pause dur short where s this going and after some chapters i thought why has he put so much detail into this one main part
0	just after nine eleven literally i think like a week after or something and there s a woman erm in a bathtub and she s been mutilated like you can t recognise her because her face has been stripped so
0	no no no no erm and then basically he gets called back into the service because he s a guy who they call the saracen
0	yeah he was mujahideen fighter erm in afghanistan
0	yeah
0	lovely
0	my anxieties about pause dur short oh er these things are pretty vocal desc laugh pretty high at the moment
0	a director or something like that
0	i know
0	yeah yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	erm but even like a month reading like a lot has meant the words that i wouldn t normally use i would go like and also i m having a better er guess at the meanings of words
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	well what s i i said oh it was someone who doesn t really show their emotions
0	and blah blah blah and then she guessed yeah yeah i suppose and then she looked at and trunc sh trunc yeah it does kind of pause dur short unclear so it was
0	like a really struggle to finish books i start them i love i trunc l trunc what i like is starting things i would i m although i m i m not sure what this says about me on a psychological level but
0	gonna be finished
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	some books you have to know like
0	well obviously with these trunc b trunc unclear ones unclear you ve got to to cos you re kind of like well
0	but er a lot of the books i read there s no real pause dur short there s no real resolution at the end of it often some of them are but some of them end quite pause dur short i don t know sort of there s always like a kind of point at the end but it s not quite
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	war zones or they ve
0	yeah
0	they haven t trunc ev trunc they ve never studied journalism in their life they just it there s there s something
0	yeah
0	don t don t don t base hunter s thompson on
0	the johnny depp movie
0	yeah
0	if anything it i m quite like
0	uhu
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh johnny depp
0	yeah
0	it s it s either hunter s thompson or someone equally pause dur short messed up pause dur short pretty sure yeah pretty sure it s hunter s thompson
0	vocal desc laugh i ve vocal desc laugh never finished anything myself
0	it s it s
0	apparently it s just the best
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	it s a good school that
0	she s like very well spoken and you know she s a trunc lo trunc lovely person you know
0	how old is she
0	anon nametype f type name pause dur short she s she lives in she lives by the erm
0	he s a divvy
0	yeah
0	that was quite nice of her to say that
0	unclear
0	if you think about the debates we used to have at you were the only person and i used to love it when we were living in uni and anon nametype m type name was obviously doing politics and you was doing like they were so intertwined and we d talk about things
0	i dunno i think i i i think i think studying stuff like maybe a bit more cultured i guess but i mean i guess i guess it s a relative term you know it s not like you can can be cultured or not cultured but
0	erm
0	well i know now that it s like reading patches vocal desc laugh
0	bits of novels i like er i i sort of like the ideas of the ideas of things more so if i can pause dur short ah i dunno i i ve i ve trunc star trunc i ve started reading like i know it sounds really stupid but reading like journals and non fiction more than pause dur short fiction that s
0	and sick of it yeah so now i wanna you know
0	trunc ag trunc agent doodle pants do you know what i mean
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	penny crayon but he like draws his own surroundings
0	vocal desc laugh
0	draw his way out of the thing
0	i mean yeah
0	yeah vocal desc laugh yeah
0	yeah yeah
0	yeah
0	and you know what i mean so it s er
0	diwali holidays are and stuff like
0	like
0	and isn t yeah
0	trunc ye trunc but you kind of you sort of people often think of like being like being well read and somehow somehow a preserve like being middle
0	class but it s not at all like
0	brilliant because like they trunc c trunc you could just tell some people i trunc remem trunc i ve seen trunc cu trunc i d see customers come in one day pick up a book and then about three days later they d be back
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	matt damon was it
0	yeah
0	erm
0	and ben affleck s just chilling
0	adam or adrien there s two pause dur short cos the
0	the one off the pianist
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and basically as the film goes on he hates his life he s like pause dur short having a midlife crisis but he s kind of he s very intelligent and very aware very well read and kind of like a guy who you talk to for hours can make other people feel happy and he shows kindness to other people but he can t find that happiness himself
0	the teachers are getting pause dur short told this that and the other and they put this they re very passionate and pause dur short it s a brilliant film it s very quite sad
0	vocal desc laugh a simpleton
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah yeah
0	i was er three percent off a first and it was pure but do you know what though you know the most best part i did all that by myself i did those fifteen thousand words i d never got my lecturer to look over it or anything or took and
0	do do you do you feel like you do you feel like you think you really came on then from your degree
0	yeah
0	definitely my degree i was still dealing with my dad
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	good
0	you re settled
0	cos uni was so hard for me cos i just you know
0	and you just wouldn t open the door
0	well i m still that way i m still like
0	i m still obsessive but just in different ways now but like erm so for me like after uni it was like having no responsibility and not really worrying too much about you know a degree and once you trunc wh trunc not worrying too much about my future and that was the best time for me cos i just had no burdens whatsoever pause dur short and i m trunc st trunc the problem for me with teaching has been that like pause dur short because like because i m so like you know really try and perfect everything and make everything perfect
0	so i think since i ve been teaching i ve i ve found that like been really struggling because you can t perfect it
0	yeah
0	and i think there s a there s a point there where like like what was i watching the other day erm that book i wanna get for erm ask my mum for christmas it s a
0	what what don mccullin s on netflix
0	yeah
0	right
0	he s talking about like you know the place i grew up in pause dur short where you had to fight where you had to get out of there and he said you know he s casually talking about the time he was taking a picture of like all the working men going
0	yeah
0	do you know what i ll go on to my amazon
0	the grass arena
0	well more or less but it s about it s about his experiences of being homeless and it was
0	should have spoke to me then anon nametype m type name
0	erm but in you know what i mean it s like er you kind of i remember reading it i read like a profile on on john healy john healy pause dur short and because he s because he s a person who has like this real lived experience and he s you know been homeless he s you know his life suffered you know he s he suffered through his life and things like that and now he has this like well he might have passed away but the last thing i read about him he erm he had like a picture of his little studio space and he had this tiny little space in london where he wrote from and you just got trunc th trunc there s something about people like that that trunc y trunc you know there s good writers and then there s kind of there s people who you really buy into like their experiences and things like that and you can t fake that it s like
0	well is he he said things like as a kid you know like his dad used to let him draw on the kitchen pause dur short kitchen wall and he used to like to draw and paint
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	do you know what i mean it s obviously straight away you re thinking that far to have the talent and then recognise it but
0	erm but he he he was really deep because he was talking like pause dur short he d get back flash flashes back cos he s witnessed people getting executed pause dur short do you know what i mean and he was like that so it s it s erm pause dur short and he d you know he said he d lost his wife and you know that was his fault but but he said he needed to do it
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	half the time it s just to make money and they just generate revenue off them
0	to know that the nine percent chance you are gonna get snatched if you re not working for the bbc or something
0	or shot
0	yeah
0	definitely
0	no no i
0	mm
0	what compels people
0	you re totally right the the
0	people that you hear of like that you just think pause dur short and the thing is when people do things not for pause dur short the erm acknowledgement they just do it
0	there s erm pause dur short i can t remember there s a there s like a a proverb about that isn t it that s just like pause dur short doing something that like if you do something without being acknowledged i can t remember what it is i think you might know it
0	but sometimes sometimes i wish that like i had a bit more a bit more grit maybe and
0	yeah that s where i was saying before like you were saying like you know this age like your friends like you re saying unclear a film set unclear and all that but that s where i start go er there is there is a side of me though that goes pause dur short i i need to go and make pause dur short a story i need to go and make something
0	but you know what halfway through i trunc thi trunc i think i m sure you probably did i was totally accustomed to those god awful trunc toi trunc
0	if if i didn t smell that mm revolting er chemical smell i was like er i m not going in there vocal desc laugh
0	can you remember though going to that hostel in bratislava and just being like pause dur short after being there for a week and then going to that pause dur short amazing
0	vocal desc laugh i remember when the girl that was talking to me was gorgeous and she was parisian and she said it s often the case of parisian people cos a lot of them are quite wealthy so she said er trunc ye trunc what did she say they re dicks but
0	yeah yeah
0	they were they were they trunc w trunc they trunc w trunc they they they were alright in the end weren t they we had a unclear
0	and then the other two made out as if they couldn t speak english
0	yeah so
0	and it s just a picture of his face and his eyes are like that and he explains for all his pictures but with a
0	yeah
0	yeah so definitely when you ve maybe time to yourself
0	yeah
0	that s like
0	so this this is a licence to practise
0	i ve got experience in the adults you see because i ve had statutory experience
0	right
0	because you ve got a little pro forma and
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	obviously you ve gotta tailor them and you can t just be like
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah it s very pause dur short yeah so part of me kind of thinks like could i really work like a big organisation again like
0	that s on friends they always talk about the fear pause dur short you know on
0	mm
0	and pause dur short it s erm pause dur short but you know trunc te trunc i mean i could pause dur short i could you know i could probably get another job in another school and pause dur short i could carry on teaching i think for years but pause dur short and i wouldn t mind doing that but i just feel a bit i feel a bit stuck really i feel a bit there s no there s no the only way i could the only way i could progress would be if you did like it s called a delta a diploma erm and that makes but then that s it i mean obviously you can go on and do like you once once you ve got a delta it s it s a three month pause dur short it s a three month qualification no less but it s it takes a long time to do erm pause dur short and then but once you ve got that that s the the limit really
0	and that s not a bad thing cos it s a really tough qualification but you you re kind of saying to yourself that er like pause dur short i can the only career i could do is either be a teacher or to to be a manager of a language school that that s kind of what you can do and you know it s the there s it s good money and stuff like that and it s a good job but you know i just kind of i just feel a bit like
0	go back to it unclear
0	i think it s good though that you know you re thinking of doing the publishing master s i think it s brilliant
0	yeah i mean it s only obviously that s helped with you know pause dur short it but that that s kind of that s kind of helped with anon nametype f type name like kind of saying you know she if we had to go to edinburgh then but i ll still do it even if if if she doesn t get the the job in edinburgh i ll still
0	would you do it here
0	oh god yeah yeah
0	definitely will mm
0	cos if it doesn t come good then you re just like a bit of a divvy
0	that s it i mean cos for me the reason i wanna get a job in anon type place because once you ve been in there for a few years then you can work anywhere pause dur short you know what i mean
0	all the time like you know i ve i ve taught the same course like about a hundred times
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and i just feel like if i do it again i ll i ll go mad er because it
0	a bit scary i wanna be scared
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah like an academic thrill ride
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but i want you know how cos then and if and if i just if but you know if i can t do it then i ll i ll do something else but
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i think trunc some trunc that s it isn t it i think sometimes as we re only human you re overthinking every paragraph going how are they gonna perceive that are they gonna think he hasn t took when
0	how how long how long did you how long did did it take you to write like what was your longest stint on an essay
0	go on no go on what was the longest time you spent on an essay as an undergraduate be honest like typing it out

1	so erm they said they d send somebody to look and i think it was probably some months later they turned up and i did trunc sp trunc speak to a gentleman pause dur short and erm he was taking a photo he wasn t actually the man who did the work he was taking a photo of what it was like because i d explained that while i was having my windows replaced i had a trunc f trunc fine view of the street outside and just a few minutes prior to school children coming along the road erm there was a sizeable bit of branch came down er so i could actually see because i had an trunc un trunc er uninterrupted view having no windows erm so er they thought about it and they were going to ring me back but of course they didn t erm because also there s a lot of growth all the way up the tree trunks along this road so when you get to a junction it s very difficult to see without sticking your bonnet right out into the road what is coming up and down at the smaller road junctions so
1	yes that s so dangerous cos i think that s how anon nametype f type name had that accident whatever happened we don t know exactly
1	unclear yeah unclear
1	because of erm that hedge erm that chap anon nametype m type name s hedge
1	mm
1	sorry i interrupt you you re telling me
1	no no so erm so anyway in the winter there s also the additional problem that you get all these wispy branches growing out from the trunk which are a bit of hazard to pedestrians
1	mm
1	and erm er children unclear and so on unclear going up and down especially when it s twilight and you can t really see them very well
1	oh i d hate to be trunc c trunc poked get poked in the eye couldn t you
1	yes i mean i i do cut the ones off facing my house but i m not entirely sure whether i m supposed to do that
1	now tell me er is it trunc bec trunc lime trees
1	they are lime trees
1	is that why they have bits that stick out of the trunk so low
1	they seem to grow like that yes because the other erm varieties don t have the same problem but erm it seemed to be originally when this was planted there were there were it was a sort of avenue of lime trees really cos they are quite close together
1	lime trees are unclear a pretty duff unclear tree aren t they all round really because erm
1	mm
1	i mean they may have some nice characteristics but they have these bits that stick out of their trunks and they re not like baby trees it s like the main branches are in the right place and then there are all this nasty sticky stuff off them have they got anything good going for them
1	yes i pause dur short well they re quite a nice bright green in leaf
1	mm
1	but the problem is they also shed a heck of a lot of leaves erm and
1	there s a lot of tree to shed leaves
1	and they seem to attract the aphids that erm make the sticky stuff that sticks all over everything
1	oh right
1	it s the the erm whatever you call it
1	greenfly
1	yes it s er trunc s trunc that sort of
1	greenflies
1	yes it s it s erm something from the greenflies i think rather than it s not the tree itself it s the fact that it s the aphids erm producing something
1	do you think they drink too drink too much of this and it makes them ill vocal desc laugh
1	i think they go they go too too mad on the on the sap and it just produces all this sticky goo
1	oh gosh i didn t know unclear
1	erm as in as in aphid throughput as it were erm so i don t know really vocal desc laugh
1	so where s that left us now
1	so that s left us now with the fact that when we were walking up the road the other day
1	yes
1	erm we observed unclear something unclear
1	having
1	as i er had gone out in the other direction er from the end of the row of erm terraces er i didn t notice until we came back
1	mm
1	from the opposite way on that particular bus that on the other side of the road they have trimmed all the offending bits off right from the traffic lights up to
1	mm
1	just beyond so erm that is why i rang them this morning to ask them if they were coming back the other way
1	i think i missed a bit of the story you said er did that did you have a man out
1	well there was a man who came out to take photos of
1	mm
1	and he said the forestry department would get back in touch with me which they haven t actually done
1	yes
1	so that is why i rang them this morning to ask them if they were coming back
1	mm
1	down the other side as i was the person
1	mm
1	or no doubt one of the people who complained on behalf of our row erm and hadn t heard anything but unfortunately i got a very pleasant gentleman who explained to me that the whole of the forestry department are on a training day
1	gone to the woods
1	vocal desc laugh so erm whether they ve gone for a picnic in the woods i don t know but as it s nice weather they were having a training day which erm seems a bit odd that everybody in forestry is there but er
1	mm
1	this chap did attempt to look up a few things but anyway they re going to ring me back tomorrow
1	did he find your case number
1	he found my case number but he couldn t see into pause dur short i don t think it was his usual job cos he said there were some other bits he couldn t get into so possibly he didn t have the right erm
1	mm
1	unclear you know unclear passwords clearance whatever to to erm use that bit of the system
1	and i suspect you ve been given the code number for fussy woman who we won t do anything about
1	well i don t know
1	that would be a good thing wouldn t it you could give people codes and they you could erm listen to what they say
1	mm
1	and then you think oh that s a really deserving person we should try and help them we ll give them code four or four four o nine or something
1	yes
1	and then oh gosh they re a real nuisance we ll give those six four seven and you d have a list on your wall
1	that s right
1	unclear have you got a code oh you re trunc s trunc you re you re the awkward person aren t you
1	i believe that happens in some places
1	really oh gosh i thought i d just invented it
1	no i think
1	nothing s new in the world unclear to be honest unclear
1	anyway erm so hopefully somebody will ring up to explain if they re coming back down the other side
1	but they they won t do that they trunc sh trunc wouldn t ve done that today because they were in the woods having their picnic
1	yes yes well hopefully they ve all had a a meaningful experience on their training day
1	mm
1	and perhaps come back revitalised but erm that s that s it
1	what time did they start did he say
1	no they didn t say what time they start but presumably not all of them are in the office there must be some out and about trunc s trunc sawing
1	some are taking photographs and some might even be cutting pieces off trees unclear sort of thing unclear
1	well they might be
1	better if he brought a saw rather than a camera did you say that s not the right piece of equipment
1	unclear well he was wearing a suit so i knew he wasn t the
1	mm
1	right man for the job but er and he s the one who gave me the piece of paper with
1	mm
1	and put the trunc co trunc put the code number on for me
1	he d have to wear a hard hat in case the branches fell on his head
1	well that s true i did offer to show him the offending branch
1	mm mm
1	cos i had it in the back garden
1	oh yes
1	but he didn t seem to be too worried about that but there we are so
1	so you wait to hear tomorrow
1	yes and er when i first rang up they before you sort of try and tell them anything they tell you oh no if it s something to do with blocking your light or various other things we or overhanging your garden blocking your light we can t do anything about that
1	but if it was somebody else s tree er as a neighbour you would have certain rights shouldn t you isn t there something about hedges shouldn t be too tall
1	hedges are a certain height
1	so surely a tree should not be that big
1	but if it s blocking your light it can t be pause dur short well these trees have probably got a preservation order on them or something i wouldn t be a bit surprised but erm that was the thing
1	mm
1	so i mean apart from the fact the tree is now wider than my house and taller than my house
1	mm
1	and the fact that my house is only fifteen feet wide it s only as wide as the lounge
1	mm mm mm
1	erm considering it s only that wide i have this tree and i also have a lamp post and a telegraph pole
1	mm
1	admittedly you know they were all there when i moved in
1	they d probably take the lamp post away these days and not give you one there
1	but erm that may happen er but you know there is rather a lot going on in the pavement outside my house
1	mm
1	considering how narrow my house is so er it is a bit tricky cos if you vocal desc laugh as when we arrived in the taxi the other day when the poor man was trying to stop to avoid
1	mm
1	so we could actually open
1	mm mm
1	both doors of the taxi vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	it is er tricky
1	mm now is there anything we need to find out cos tomorrow unclear tomorrow s thursday isn t it
1	yes
1	so we ve got thursday and friday is there anything we need to possibly ask about the triathlon on sunday isn t it
1	well we can we can have a go at the website i have tried
1	mm
1	putting in the thing for the the w w for the trunc w trunc work website
1	yes unclear
1	but it s got an interactive map
1	mm mm
1	but it seems to have a life of its own
1	would you write that on your things to do you could put it down at the bottom if it s not the most important thing
1	so look up triathlon i think i ve worked the route out looking at the yellow signs
1	and we need to estimate the difference trunc betw trunc different the distance not different and between here and
1	and the park
1	anon type place so we can go for our very own teddy bears picnic on your birthday
1	this is true
1	as long as we can manage the walking
1	well the it s difficult this weekend as well because having the roads closed round here because some people are having queen events er this weekend
1	yes yes that s sunday too it s she s decided to have her birthday
1	because down the road in anon type place they re having er street parties
1	mm mm
1	and things
1	mm
1	now if you re somebody from outside who s going there you know
1	mm
1	trunc f trunc friends of erm unclear i d unclear you re gonna have to vocal desc laugh stay the night i would think because you re not going to be able to drive down there
1	mm
1	from one o clock in the morning
1	well i think the idea of a street party is you just have the neighbours
1	i know but you know it s just
1	which is at least something you can do if you can t go out unclear
1	no but if there s relatives
1	yes
1	you know if somebody s parents are coming
1	mm
1	or children or whatever then erm
1	mm
1	you know they ve got to make sure they re in situ cos er
1	yes
1	there s no transport
1	no quick dash to waitrose before it starts
1	no vocal desc laugh so er there we are so how far to anon type place well if we drive that way tomorrow i can clock it
1	mm pause dur short now you wanted to look at something in anon type place
1	ah anon type place now where was i going in anon type place
1	it was a shop i don t know why you wanted to look at the shop to see if there was parking outside
1	ah no i wanted to establish where that shop was
1	do we know the name of the shop
1	it s the one that may potentially well it s a branch of the one that may potentially
1	do you want to write the name down and i ll look it up
1	may potentially be interested in buying anon nametype m type name s vast collection of speakers or at least the big ones that we can t move the trouble is they re they re not people who come and collect well he said he didn t come and collect in town but
1	okay well trunc le trunc let s just establish what we can about the shop cos there might be some things we could take there
1	unclear but unclear the other man doesn t want them because they re too big for his shop
1	no unclear
1	but they re very they have a very good tone
1	okay erm
1	and i was going to go into anon type place the erm
1	estate agent
1	er ironmongers
1	mm
1	next to anon type place well it isn t anon type place school what was anon type place school
1	what your school
1	yes
1	oh yes
1	erm
1	ironmongers
1	anon type place yes
1	mm
1	it s just a few doors along er it s no longer mr anon nametype n type name there was a mr anon nametype n type name
1	is that the really small shop with all the trunc bo trunc all the trunc bo trunc where you can t can t exactly throw your arms and legs about
1	no that s that s in anon type place this is an er ironmongers general shop
1	mm
1	locksmith he s the locksmith who
1	mm mm
1	who looked at anon nametype m type name s door and then er he s no longer mr anon nametype n type name who was a
1	mm
1	erm a very anon type place gentleman he retired in about nineteen eighty and erm somebody else another man took it over erm and there were various people work there and they re they re very helpful but it is one of these shops you walk in they have had it er slightly modernised but you walk up and down the rows and there s just sort of you know boxes of all sorts of hardware stuff and you can buy lengths of chain and erm you know sort of plugs or bigger
1	mm
1	and all sorts of things and he s he s got very good unclear lot of unclear locks and so so forth he s the man who came to anon nametype m type name s and took the lock away that second lock because they no longer make a lock that would fit in that particular door erm because it s probably the original one so he took it away and replaced some of its insides
1	mm
1	rather than
1	for a very reasonable price
1	for a very reasonable price trunc n trunc so you didn t have to have another lock which would ve meant cutting a whole different section out of the door
1	mm
1	and making a mess erm and he was very helpful and he and he also supplied me with erm numerous keys which is what
1	yes
1	i needed just for the you know for the same price as you d pay for unclear bought it with the lock unclear unclear
1	yes i checked in timpson s and they said erm yale and mortice they cost six or seven pounds each
1	a very nice man pause dur short no well these in anon type place they re they re two pounds
1	mm i thought i d pay about two pounds
1	yeah
1	so i think i might shop around but i had to get the car key done there
1	yeah but if you wanted to it probably wouldn t be much use cos you wouldn t try them but erm you i mean you could have a key cut there trunc th trunc they re usually alright
1	mm pause dur short i haven t got any with me so
1	no but you wouldn t be able to try them very readily cos it s rather a long way to your house but erm they re very good anyway that s that is a proper ironmongers type shop and there is that one there used to be one in anon type place
1	mm
1	erm run by a very nice sikh gentleman who died unfortunately
1	mm
1	he was quite old and his wife and his son ran it for a while but his it wasn t really his son s
1	mm
1	kind of job erm but unfortunately they trunc ha trunc are no longer there erm they did have to close but there is the place in anon type place i mentioned erm round the corner from audio republic erm hi fi shop and near what used to be anon nametype m type name s fish and chip shop
1	mm
1	that s now
1	mm
1	been taken over
1	mm
1	erm just on that little corner there is erm an older gentleman who has a shop that is as you say you walk in and he s got a little tiny counter and there s shelves floor to ceiling and you just stand in a little area
1	mm
1	he knows where everything is but you can t actually circulate because it s tiny
1	mm
1	he he just unclear unclear you unclear
1	what s he what s that one called
1	erm now i can t remember that one s name but it s something like two people s names put together or pause dur short it s not bilko vocal desc laugh cos that s a different programme altogether but it s
1	mm
1	it s like er
1	it s er something that sounds like a shop name but it part of it s probably his name
1	mm mm
1	because he also has that on some of his little packets of nuts and bolts and things
1	yes
1	okay and i ve got that erm dawn to dusk kind of nightlight
1	mm
1	thing there which is erm it s an led it s not a bulb one
1	mm
1	anymore
1	mm
1	so that er that s a very nice shop to look in
1	so sorry what was it you wanted to buy in anon type place vocal desc cough
1	face mask er not a face mask a trunc du trunc i was considering there was a place to buy a dust mask or dust masks disposable
1	unclear bought some there have you
1	unclear i bought those in wilkos
1	but there must have been something else you wanted you just said we could go er sorry i thought you said we could go to anon type place
1	no er i i was thinking of going to anon type place
1	but you don t need to
1	no anon type place or because i trunc w trunc as i was in town waiting for your delayed train
1	yeah yeah
1	erm i er went in there and got some like the ones i had before
1	mm
1	although as i said to you the it was funny because i said to the man i i i was in the hardware section but i said to this chap erm i m looking for face masks and he kind of looked at me a bit strangely cos i he was in some quandary as to whether i wanted like a face pack or a
1	mm oh right
1	a mask to wear in bed
1	yeah
1	cos i said i don t want it something to cover my eyes when i m in bed i said i don t want anything cosmetics
1	oh yes
1	being a lady although i don t look that much of the sort of lady who would have unclear them unclear
1	do you call them face masks
1	i don t unclear
1	unclear
1	erm they re dust masks
1	oh right okay
1	so i said erm
1	unclear so he d ve wanted unclear to give you mud a mud pack
1	yes so he wanted to give me something for a lady really i think
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but he didn t like to say that because it is not politically correct
1	no
1	so i trunc s trunc i sort of said oh i said i want to wear it for sanding down vocal desc laugh
1	mm probably he was erm
1	chiselling my features yeah
1	unclear really trying to think how he could say it without unclear unclear giving you unclear potentially
1	well that s right so i thought i d jump we were in that section i said you know cos i said you know for sanding and keeping so you re not breathing in dust particles
1	mm mm
1	because i m i m vocal desc laugh turning out a cellar and he then sort of looked at me even more strangely vocal desc laugh
1	yes well
1	trunc w trunc what is this woman doing
1	mm
1	erm so erm and then he i must ve walked passed them but he pointed them out to me i said oh yes i said they re the ones i usually have vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	as if i m always wearing them vocal desc laugh
1	mm
1	er so that was quite funny you can get these strange women in shops
1	yeah very strange
1	so er so that s er
1	yes
1	why i bought them and erm drove to the station with them vocal desc yawn
1	talking about the cellar i trunc w trunc looked i m tempted to send the photographs from the carlton bicycle brochure that we you showed me
1	yes
1	to anon nametype m type name i think he might quite like it
1	mm
1	but i don t like to tempt him with things that he can t have
1	well he trunc ca trunc trunc w trunc he could have it but he can t have it cos we can t get it there
1	no
1	unless he s thinking of sponsoring himself to ride it back to anon type place vocal desc laugh
1	mm mm mm mm
1	er or anon type place
1	mm
1	i should say in his case shouldn t i yes
1	oh he was also saying something very strange cos he s quite every time he s he tries to give us carrier bags now when we see him
1	oh right
1	erm because he doesn t like
1	unclear bag for life
1	he doesn t pause dur short yes well apparently
1	yeah
1	he lives in that you know a flat and
1	yeah
1	i think there s six in the block
1	yes
1	and he said you know now you have to pay for carrier bags
1	yes
1	he said trunc hi trunc his dustbin erm gets completely stuffed up with bag for life carrier bags that he takes out of the dustbin
1	yeah
1	takes back to the shop i think and gets a new one
1	oh right
1	because people think it s better value
1	mm
1	to erm presumably
1	well those are much
1	buy the thick one rather than the thin one but when they get trunc h trunc
1	mm
1	because the thin one breaks on the way home from the shop and then they just throw them straightaway and they don t even recycle them
1	no but perhaps they can t
1	anon type place s gone funny about recycling cos they er they ve taken the green bin er well your brown bin my green bin
1	yes
1	er away and maybe they re they re taking the er no i think at the moment you can still do the plastic one
1	they ve taken the recycling bins away
1	yeah
1	unclear oh they ve unclear taken the one that you put er compostables in and garden rubbish so that means people are putting them in the black bins
1	yes yes
1	and they ll get charged more for landfill
1	yes yes
1	presumably
1	yeah pause dur short and next year they re going to take away the plastic trunc re trunc you know the the one you put your paper in and your glass and your plastic er that is the recycling bin do they have different
1	well hold on
1	you can t
1	i can t have glass
1	i ve got a black bin
1	yes yeah
1	that s household general non recyclable rubbish
1	trunc h trunc yeah pause dur short and i guess it gets very
1	so we re common on black
1	yes we re common on black
1	i ve got a green bin that i put green things in
1	garden waste which yours is brown my garden waste is brown
1	you ve got another bin
1	but it s only selected garden waste specially selected
1	yes i know you can only put pause dur short windfall apples and not apple peelings
1	yes pause dur short mm pause dur short yes vocal desc cough
1	okay that s the one that they ve lost
1	you can t put any organic
1	mm
1	well any sort of food waste or you can t put any
1	mm
1	any because our system doesn t kind of cook it all up
1	no no
1	whereas your system does
1	yeah
1	so it the microbes don t get unclear deaded unclear
1	except it doesn t in anon type place now unless you pay fifty pounds
1	right
1	but i don t know how they identify whose bin should be emptied for fifty pounds
1	no
1	okay
1	perhaps it has a big pound sign on it in gold
1	yeah and then we ve got the third bin which i is blue for me
1	or when they lift the lid it goes kerching
1	unclear mm yes unclear
1	cos it s making money for the council vocal desc laugh
1	i ve got one that s blue
1	yes
1	that i can put plastic erm glass
1	mm
1	and all that sort of stuff and i ve got the paper that s the one that has the paper caddy in it
1	well you ve got subdivisions haven t you
1	yes
1	you ve got carrier you ve got sub trays sort of things
1	i ve got paper yes
1	paper
1	yeah
1	trays
1	except anon nametype f type name in anon type place they just throw it all in one
1	yes
1	so all the paper gets all mixed up with the
1	yes but when it goes for sorting they must be able to segregate that
1	oh they do sort they do take it out again but it gets a bit spoilt
1	because my green my green bin
1	mm
1	which is my recycling bin you can put some sorts of paper in it but you just lob it all in together although you probably should take it to an actual specified paper thing at the dump or at the supermarket you know post it in
1	do you put cardboard in that one
1	no er what i can put it in mine
1	yes
1	yes i can put cardboard in my own personal green bin i can put
1	and you just put the paper in the whole bin you don t put it separately
1	no it all goes in together but i don t put papers in there because when i er because i we have to trunc s trunc recycle glass ourself ourselves
1	mm
1	we can t put them in the bin i take the glass and the paper together because i can put it in either the tip ones or i can do it up at the shopping centre erm so i don t personally erm put my newspapers in
1	okay
1	i do put envelopes and odd bits of
1	mm
1	kitchen erm wrapping off er you know trunc f trunc suitable paper
1	mm
1	that s been on a food item and we can t put glass in
1	no
1	so the problem here is if if you don t live near a glass recycling bin then erm you have great difficulties like anon nametype m type name next door who hasn t got a car he if he wanted to take glass to recycle he d have to take it on the bus with him cos there s nowhere within walking distance in this area because the people would probably complain about the noise vocal desc laugh erm but erm for example the old lady anon nametype f type name we know
1	yeah
1	in another bit of anon type place she hasn t even got a bus available to catch or anything so she just puts all her glass
1	mm
1	in the dustbin unless she
1	mm
1	has given it to me to recycle not that she has that much or she has to give it to the person who gets her shopping to do something with
1	mm pause dur short she s very naughty with things
1	but
1	because i saw her in her back garden and she had some litter in her back garden
1	yeah
1	and she just poked it through her gate or round her gate into the street
1	yes because it is not her litter vocal desc laugh
1	which i didn t i didn t think that was quite the public spirited trunc s trunc approach
1	no
1	erm especially as an agoraphobic who doesn t go in her house went down her garden to her bottom of her
1	mm
1	garden
1	yeah
1	admittedly not a very big garden to to put her erm to put her er litter out
1	well trunc sh trunc she will go down there pause dur short cos she has to put her that s why she her bin s there but erm
1	mm pause dur short even er more reason why she should put it in her bin but anyway one shouldn t be
1	mm i don t know
1	yes but anyway what i was saying is anon nametype f type name the bin that your green bin my blue bin
1	yeah
1	they re going to scrap in anon type place next year
1	recycling
1	yeah which is ridiculous
1	yeah unclear
1	it s absolutely not thought through all the council tax will go up and unclear landfill
1	yes pause dur short yeah yeah pause dur short question
1	mm yes
1	unclear yeah unclear so there we are and of course round not where that lady lives they haven t been told but we were told by the council that if we leave our bin out after the time it s after the day it s been collected so you re supposed to put your bin out before seven in the morning or certainly not till the night before
1	mm
1	if it s then still out after it s been collected and you haven t put it away by you know the next day presumably erm you there is a possibility you will be fined seventy five pounds per bin
1	mm
1	which is a bit much if it s only certain areas unclear are getting unclear unclear
1	yes absolutely erm but they haven t they you put your bin out and they haven t emptied it
1	but then there s the problem with the fact that i put my bin out i do tend to put my bin out slightly earlier than evening because i m not walking all the way round
1	mm
1	the back of my terrace and round to put my bin out the front where it gets collected in the dark
1	yes it s hardly a a trivial activity taking your bin out
1	or in the winter no i mean it is quite a distance
1	mm
1	as there s only one end we can get round the terrace
1	mm
1	erm so there is that and also the fact like today i put it out yesterday afternoon erm late sort of it was out late afternoon ready for the and it s a wide pavement so it s not actually blocking anybody s way
1	mm
1	and erm as we find coming back tonight it just hasn t been emptied
1	mm
1	so are they coming tomorrow
1	well they can t fine you by not unclear putting unclear it in
1	so i ve pulled it into the gateway
1	mm
1	will they consider that sufficiently out on the street erm and also you re really supposed to push it to the kerb now if on the day
1	vocal desc laugh
1	two of my bins are if on the day when my brown and my green bin are collected on the same day which it should ve been this particular week but i didn t put the green one out cos it wasn t full enough erm it means there is a hazard because i ve got the as previously mentioned i ve got the tree which is an old tree so it s got a good girth on it
1	mm
1	the lamp post admittedly the telegraph pole is further back and then i ve got two bins cos you re supposed to put them on the edge of the kerb
1	yes
1	which means there s quite a run of that bit of road
1	mm
1	for anybody parking
1	mm
1	where they won t their passengers would not be able to get out vocal desc laugh vocal desc cough
1	mm
1	so i m not quite sure where we are on the seventy five pound argument i don t think anybody s
1	no
1	erm taken the council to task on that one if they ve been tried to be fined but it is a bit much to fine this area i suppose it s because a lot of houses in this area are big
1	yes
1	detached houses
1	yeah
1	and they think unclear well unclear people won t you know they can afford to do it and they won t make they might kick up a fuss but they ll pay anyway
1	and if you live in a back to back it gets a bit difficult doesn t it cos you haven t got a
1	well you have to put it down in er
1	oh you might if you re a street if you re on a if you re a back to back you you trunc ha trunc do you have a front garden
1	some yeah well where we lived at anon type place did
1	yes i was thinking it did
1	but back to backs that are on the street like the ones they ve still got in anon type place unclear six unclear
1	mm
1	every few houses there s a common yard where the bins tend to go
1	oh right
1	but you ve got to wheel your bin up or down
1	mm
1	to get it in and also those streets if you think of going down to the main road they re very steep and a lot of people chain their bins to the downpipes or whatever because if you put your bin out
1	mm
1	well it doesn t need to be icy but if you live on a steep hill
1	mm
1	you haven t got a level surface to put your bin have you
1	oh i see and they trunc s trunc they sliddle down the hill
1	well if that s a possibility because they re really steep roads
1	yes
1	and you haven t really got a flat area cos you ve got no garden to pull something in and lean it on the gatepost
1	so do you have to unchain it every week
1	but i have noticed there are some that are chained
1	mm
1	but i don t think i think some of them do keep them chained to their erm thingy bob but as i say some of the other houses they do have erm
1	mm
1	they do have those little yard areas communal yards that you can keep your bin in
1	it s not a problem in anon type place you know
1	no no back to backs
1	no no no erm you wouldn t have to chain it for that reason
1	oh
1	it wouldn t go down the slope
1	oh no it d be flat i see what you mean
1	yes
1	yes yes and probably you don t have to have a problem in anon type place either unclear
1	no there s a few areas that are fine although in anon type place you might get a bit unclear bogged down unclear
1	yes so
1	okay
1	there we are so we ll see if anybody turns up for my bin tomorrow
1	yes yes is it full
1	i would like that one emptied cos it is the garden bin
1	mm
1	so it is full of garden stuff
1	yes
1	and i do need to cut the hedge
1	yes
1	so i ll need another empty bin
1	yes
1	okay

1	yeah well we ve got
1	lawn
1	yeah that s just lawn pause dur short we had more when we did the front garden
1	do you reckon so
1	that was all lawn
1	it can t be quite half an acre can it
1	well of course it is if you if you think we ve got we ve got about two and seven eighths isn t it or nearly two hectares
1	yeah mm well i should think one is the field isn t it
1	yeah there s a there s
1	or three quarters of it
1	yeah i don t really know how much it is but

1	oh dear
1	so they say oh pause dur short well who put them on there
1	oh you really ought to come out and see the sheep you know pause dur short all the way down anon type place
1	well i had too much to do you went gallivanting
1	thirty seven sheep there are in the village
1	that s really brilliant
1	it is isn t it
1	yeah
1	and some of them are so good pause dur short that includes the two real ones
1	pardon
1	that includes the two real ones
1	who who had the real ones
1	anon nametype f type name
1	oh of course she would wouldn t she
1	yeah penned up outside pause dur short they ve been ever so good
1	well why didn t we go in for it
1	why what
1	why didn t we do a sheep
1	it s well were unclear weren t we pause dur short we got too busy with other things
1	everything happens at once doesn t it pause dur short that s a real problem
1	some of them are very inventive
1	well we could have done a sheep i could have stood out there dressed up as trunc sh trunc
1	some are just wooden heads you know
1	yeah
1	and some are kind of well pause dur short well there s so many different things there s even one just with a black bin liner which doesn t look very good pause dur short but it s a black sheep
1	but i could have actually stood out there looking sheepish
1	no no that s not the idea pause dur short mind you there s one down anon nametype n type name road pause dur short they ve put a a boy s face on it which is not very nice
1	yeah well he looks sheepish
1	yeah he looks he s was hanging hanging over the fence pause dur short i didn t like that one pause dur short a bit creepy
1	no it s fun it s not creepy
1	yeah no that one was quite creepy
1	was it
1	you ll know what i mean mm pause dur short it s like you re being trunc hu trunc the boy was being hung pause dur short cos it was like a a woolly jumper on as well
1	that would have been a good one pause dur short just hang a jumper outside there and a and a and a big high jump thing
1	a big what
1	a high jump right
1	mm
1	and then a woolly jumper
1	mm
1	on a spring
1	no head
1	no it s just a woolly jumper
1	oh gosh
1	god come on keep up keep up
1	i don t know if they checked out these sheep before they went up pause dur short they all have numbers and they all have letters and you have to collect up all the letters and rearrange it to make a saying
1	a wolf in sheep s clothing
1	could be pause dur short well that s a good idea isn t cos
1	that s brilliant
1	like someone was saying it it really gets you to see anon type place because they re talking about all the different roads so many different roads and so widespread
1	i know anon type place is
1	i mean to be right up here and right down er er down anon type place way
1	yeah
1	that s a lot isn t it
1	yeah it is a lot and it s you know you have one thousand and well over one i don t know whether it s one thousand three hundred or one thousand five hundred dwellings pause dur short and if if you put two people to each dwelling that s three thousand people in anon type place
1	yeah it is quite big
1	so i don t know whether i m right or wrong but i think there s about one thousand one hundred trunc pe trunc er dwellings in anon type place
1	mm
1	that will still make three people two thousand two hundred doesn t it
1	yeah
1	but they think there s three thousand people in anon type place
1	right
1	well that s because trunc i trunc if you think of two and a half people or three and a half people to one household
1	yeah
1	cos anon type place school is about five hundred pupils in that
1	mm
1	isn t there
1	yeah

1	oh right yeah
1	because there wasn t enough going on so i just told to watch out for that pause dur short but she just thinks she wants to do more so she won t be hopefully and erm anon nametype f type name is very keen on dramatics of course
1	yeah well she always was
1	and she s been asked to do plays and and do a lot of singing in it
1	mm
1	she said she s too nervous but she ll be alright
1	no she she did lots of stuff with us didn t she when she was here

1	yeah pause dur short you could see where she was going in life but i thought anon nametype f type name was going the wildlife way
1	yeah well i asked about that so she said she was she s still very keen on er pause dur short on wildlife and that but they don t go out so much at the weekends now pause dur short cos of petrol and stuff they re finding it difficult pause dur short she s still on her own but kind of with pause dur short do you remember the fireman at that fancy dress party
1	yeah
1	i trunc j trunc she said i only have to say do you know the fireman and everyone seems to remember the fireman obviously
1	yeah well cos he looked like erm him off
1	a bit like robson green
1	robson green didn t he he looked like him didn t he pause dur short and everyone fell in love with him immediately
1	and er he was very good looking anyway wasn t he
1	well you fell in love with him
1	well perhaps the universe perhaps the uniform again
1	well it is the uniform isn t it
1	but anyway she s she s she s known him for about fourteen years and they ve seeing each other properly but he lives in anon type place pause dur short he used to he came from wales for that party
1	yeah
1	right she that s how long she s know him so they ve been keeping in touch since that

1	yeah and he s a lovely bloke
1	he hasn t got any children pause dur short always wanted children so pause dur short it seems quite quite good
1	well maybe he should get in touch with a younger trunc bir trunc person
1	what
1	well she s too late to have children now isn t she pause dur short more
1	no
1	i m talking about whether he want one of his own or not
1	oh no i don t think so cos he s got the same age now and pause dur short ah anyway they re seeing each other and they re very happy
1	oh that s good
1	even though it s only one a month pause dur short roughly
1	that s yeah well that s enough to see anyone
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	okay pause dur long
1	yeah well what did they used to say pause dur short once a night always a night once a month enough
1	right oh
1	it s true isn t it
1	or don t you believe that i don t know if that was the right one the right word
1	it s not the right one but i ve i ve put my my cape on my my
1	adapted it yeah
1	slant on it
1	yeah anyway she s seems very happy and that s oh it was really nice to have a chat because she erm i said oh hello she just said she caught me cos i m just eating this trunc ca trunc great big cake
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i said i m just taking a break i m supposed to be doing the er promoting
1	taking a break eating a cake
1	promoting the er pause dur short enterprise place
1	oh yeah she works there doesn t she
1	yeah so she s in her she got a top thing
1	oh right she works there
1	anon type place
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	oh wow
1	so i actually i held her up for quite a long time and they don t have trunc pre trunc her colleague had to do it all by himself
1	well that wasn t
1	by herself pause dur short and so yeah she said oh you caught me pause dur short sit down pause dur short so i sat down cos she happened to be at the table which was kind of nice
1	well she would be eating a cake
1	no i just happened to be next to her stall i don t know
1	oh i see right yeah
1	it wasn t wasn t the cakey bit if you see what i mean pause dur short not where they were selling them
1	oh right she d already bought it
1	yeah
1	and took it to her table
1	yeah
1	ah
1	so i had a nice long chat with her
1	well she s a lovely lady
1	she is nice isn t she
1	yeah she is pause dur short she s had a hard life
1	yeah oh she and she told me about their dad as well pause dur short she said he s coming over to see them at christmas pause dur short but er pause dur short anon nametype f type name she cos because we re not connected now i think she feels like she can talk a bit more about that type of thing
1	probably yeah yeah
1	anyway because er you know pause dur short anon nametype f type name s a bit more reserved but anon nametype f type name still thinks he s the most wonderful person in the world pause dur short and
1	well she would do because she s young now
1	well she would do yeah
1	yeah
1	but they they always they always get so excited when they find out he s coming over to see them and then then it all goes wrong and they re so disillusioned and it all goes wrong again pause dur short and they sort of
1	well that s because they expect too much probably
1	probably is
1	i mean trunc i trunc trunc i trunc if you think of what these families that are separated have to do pause dur short the bloke actually takes people takes their his children to cos never that s never the bloke that s that s erm got unclear
1	it s sad isn t it not usually no
1	with the children no
1	yeah
1	so the bloke has to come along and he has to treat them doesn t he
1	yes
1	cos he only sees them probably once a week or
1	mm
1	if he s lucky so he treats them and then he becomes the trunc wo trunc most wonderful person in the world
1	mm
1	because the others pause dur short they re just the mundane life you go to school you get up in the morning you have to you have to get dressed and you do all this that and the other and and you have the the ordinary bit of life pause dur short whereas the dad comes along once or twice once a week or whenever and treats them to a circus or a a zoo or a show and he gets the best he gets he gets the points doesn t he
1	he does in general pause dur short yeah
1	he gets the points and you know they look forward to it
1	and mum has to say pause dur short clean up your room
1	and mum has to say come one clean up your room get on with your life
1	help help us with the washing up and all the rest of it
1	yeah and they go oh dad isn t like that pause dur short dad take us here dad take us there pause dur short but the boot on the other foot would be pause dur short mum taking them everywhere and dad doing the mundane jobs like er taking them to school and getting them dressed and doing all that business
1	yeah
1	you know it s just it s just
1	but in anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name s case because he s in anon type place isn t he
1	yeah
1	and they get so excited and then pause dur short it s he s he doesn t do the nice things pause dur short like they re expecting i suppose
1	well
1	he s not the wonderful person that
1	kids have got too much expectations anyway haven t they
1	yeah
1	i mean you have only got to trunc b trunc think about christmas pause dur short and they have all these wonderful wonderful
1	well it is like that with ordinary families isn t it pause dur short
1	well it is
1	at christmas you think oh it will be great to see so and so again and that and then they either turn up boring or
1	yeah vocal desc laugh well that s like when we trunc ha trunc when you have parties and stuff like that
1	yeah
1	i mean i went to the class of fifty nine pause dur short nineteen fifty nine pause dur short right and i went to this this reunion i knew well i knew about three people and all the rest of them were old and i looked at them and thought

1	did i ever know you did i ever i i can t remember you i trunc kno trunc i i remembered about three people because i ve kept in contact with them since we left school
1	mm
1	you know
1	otherwise it s a huge gap isn t it
1	that s a massive gap you you think of trunc fif trunc nineteen fifty nine to the year two thousand pause dur short that s that s forty one years
1	and you re talking about from about fifteen
1	yeah
1	from fifteen onwards well you change dramatically fifteen to thirty don t
1	god you have yeah
1	i mean fifteen to twenty even
1	but there there there is one regret i have about that about not meeting my headmaster mr anon nametype m type name who was an absolute fantastic bloke and er pause dur short i wanted to thank him for what he did for me
1	mm
1	but of course i never got round to it pause dur short you don t think of that do you until until it s too late
1	no you don t
1	it s like that s like telling your father you love him
1	yeah
1	which no bloke ever does
1	or or anyone unclear anything anyone
1	or yeah you know
1	you don t you don t do it otherwise they think what s wrong
1	you don t think pause dur short yeah yeah

0	er we all hear our own voice as a more deep and resonant version than how others perceive it but why exactly is that put simply it has to do with the difference between air conducted versus bone conducted bone sound transmission so it s basically because we hear our own voice going through our bones it come out different than people who hear it through the air interesting pause dur long
0	we met through herbal life but we are friends he keeps unclear blagging unclear me to try and start it again and it s like well i haven t got time like

0	unclear
0	it s so funny
0	erm if i what you mean like against viruses and stuff
0	yeah i really dislike white anon nametype f type name i really dislike her
0	she s just a bit
0	she s just not very nice person like trunc sh trunc like whenever they go out like anon nametype f type name would invite me but whoever anon nametype f type name s there she never invites me or you and it like and whenever like we all go out like varsity she were with anon nametype m type name she didn t want to come like i think she s just a jealous person i think she s jealous that we re we re all good friends and she doesn t like it
0	but i mean like but not saying this is a bad way but i was friends with anon nametype f type name before anon nametype f type name was
0	yeah
0	yeah but no like i just always got the feeling that like i kind of knew we wouldn t be friends because when you get that vibe off someone it doesn t really matter like you re not going to be friends with everyone but i unclear that she wasn t interested in trying to become my friend or anything so i tried a few times being nice to her and making conversation i wasn t really getting much back so i just thought oh alright then i don t really care
0	yeah
0	yeah and like anon nametype f type name is just like well you re gonna have to get a taxi back to my house there s no taxis you don t have key and like she just made everyone leave
0	ruining it for everyone
0	like if the other girls didn t want to stay they have a voice
0	like you just say i m gonna go home now like no one cares or like they care but it s not
0	like and she does and she did want to leave because anon nametype f type name wanted to leave and that s what rachel s like and i understand that me and anon nametype f type name aren t really that close anyway and i don t really care about that cos she s annoying but like i understood that anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name did actually want to leave but anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name didn t and anon nametype f type name were making them and was like you re such a bitch like why are you being so rude like it s my party i ve invited you
0	yeah it is awful
0	like cos i ve i ve always got that vibe off them but i would give them the benefit of the doubt cos i am like maybe it s just me being paranoid because i am a very paranoid person i m insecure i know that
0	right
0	and then she said i m picking them up and i ll have to drop them off to come and get you so do you mind just like making your own way to my house on your own like and she said that last minute like at five o clock she s meant to be picking me up at half five and then i found out that they all went out for a meal didn t invite me didn t ask me to go and then like she was just like oh you need to get a taxi to my house like i was like okay
0	and i was like why are you being so fucking mean like what what problem have you got exactly against me like
0	yeah i think that she s just not really interested in going outside of her circle like making the effort with new people which you know fair enough i don t care
0	yeah but yeah
0	if you re gonna make me feel like that
0	being there and feeling like you re not wanted
0	that s a shame though cos they were friends weren t they
0	yeah like really close friends but like
0	well anon nametype f type name doesn t like anon nametype m type name because anon nametype m type name was really mean to anon nametype f type name in the first part the start of their relationship like he was really like he was really i don t know like he was just really rude to anon nametype f type name like he d say stuff to her and like he was using her at first and then obviously they started going out but like anon nametype f type name has never really forgiven him she doesn t really like him
0	because anon nametype f type name changes when she s with anon nametype m type name she s not a nice girl erm and like well fair enough but she still wouldn t let anyone say anything bad about anon nametype f type name but then when she said that to me on her way to chester i was just like well er it s obviously not just me that thinks she s a cunt then
0	that s awful
0	yeah
0	it was so fucking cruel i was like why did you do that why did you just leave if you don t like me fair me fair enough but there s no need to be fucking horrible
0	yeah or like if
0	cos anon nametype f type name were battered so i know anon nametype f type name didn t do it like anon nametype f type name
0	like it were your idea to leave to go back to your house
0	but like if you don t like someone you don t like someone there s no need to be fucking horrible to them but like i always make an effort to like to talk to them or something we re never gonna be nasty to her like cos that s stooping to her level but that s what she s like so just be wary like if you ever out on a night out and she s there then don t let them leave you
0	no i mean like if you re with anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name and anon nametype f type name
0	what s that you re putting on

0	where was that
0	no
0	a lot of money
0	yeah no and that s what s hard now it s like like but the er thing is as well with that is that like cos gyms charge so much to rent
0	yeah and especially in anon type place i can imagine renting in a place in anon type place is
0	to rent for sure if they can like it s like four hundred to four hundred and fifty a month and erm erm pause dur short and like somewhere like anon type place gym

0	i know i think waiting
0	i ve i m so so keen to
0	yeah
0	i mean talking like important stuff like that through with them i think is
0	yeah
0	so i will probably have to borrow some money from them or my
0	but in the long run
0	but i wanna do it
0	i don t really know where i wanna go with it i know roughly but i m more doing it because i want i m interested in it
0	that i trunc thi trunc
0	and it s like anything if you have an interest in something it s amazing
0	yeah
0	yeah no yeah
0	yeah
0	so i can do that
0	and if not i still have a publishing career of four years
0	like i think that s awesome
0	yeah no you re leaving but yeah
0	oh yeah but i only live like fifteen or twenty minutes down the road so
0	yeah

0	like the amount of effort is gonna be reduced that
0	yeah
0	you re there to learn
0	it ll be nice to meet people
0	but i that was not like i have friends like
0	i know and er yeah it s done and that
0	like yeah

0	so her school erm her school became an academy
0	and so the academy just came in and basically is just making everybody
0	okay
0	like i think my dad
0	yeah
0	i don t think so
0	if i went to anon type place obviously it would be an issue and i wouldn t i would probably stay in anon type place
0	that would be quite rough
0	but
0	erm or i if i m there two days a week and i stay in anon type place
0	cos that was true like the erm hours driving in probably aren t that much
0	yeah
0	can be more like law er like a law conversions are like twelve grand
0	aren t they my friend s brother s just done one so trunc mu trunc that s why i assumed they were all that much money
0	okay
0	but i always wanted to be a lawyer
0	a lot
0	massive
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	okay
0	well that s quite that s quite nice
0	a change
0	isn t it yeah
0	would if you wanted or went to uni would you go to university around here
0	so i can stay at home
0	erm pause dur short yeah i trunc thi trunc like there are cos like it s the only thing is what you said as well like unis all the way round here are all
0	but a degree s a degree at the end of the day
0	like
0	yeah
0	really
0	it s top er
0	no
0	but yeah i don t know i think i will probably to be honest i kind of have the idea that i think i ll get stuck into working
0	yeah
0	haven t you so
0	it s not like you need one
0	like a year i would be like okay three years if i m trunc hone trunc
0	yeah
0	or want to yeah like it d be like you fucking hate it yeah
0	probably will happen
0	yeah
0	option
0	but also
0	yeah
0	but pause dur short like yeah like professional sports level
0	but trunc e trunc everyday like you know normal level
0	people don t care if you ve got a degree people care if you even know what you re talking about
0	so if i see anon nametype f type name all over the world in a few years it will be you with like this like amazing sculptured body
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah which be like oh yeah
0	yeah
0	so not beauty anymore but more fitness
0	and depressing so

0	so yeah i was like
0	yeah
0	oh i love them now
0	they re my favourite jeans they re like
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	yeah pause dur short it wouldn t be that simple pause dur short cos i know it wouldn t cos that s what happened last year pause dur short no i ve had that experience and pause dur short i dunno pause dur short i think trunc no trunc i might feel differently if i left here because i feel like if i left here it would be pause dur short under my own circumstances and i d feel a bit more like in control of it
0	mm
0	okay
0	erm pause dur short yeah like i
0	or only first term
0	i know pause dur short i but at least i don t have to pay it back now like the other stuff i unclear don t unclear
0	yeah that s that s trunc wai trunc that s pause dur short saved for later thankfully vocal desc laugh
0	mm
0	erm pause dur short vocal desc misc
0	i didn t have any friends
0	yeah i mean it s like pause dur short when you don t pause dur short get on with your flatmates like i know like it s the worst possible thing because you re living with them and it s
0	it is it s pause dur short it s such a big pause dur short thing like it really contributes to pause dur short whether i still like i trunc we trunc i dunno how i d feel really if i didn t have a good flat this year
0	i would probably have left already doing this
0	mm
0	i mean i i guess a good flat means that like pause dur short you ve got something nice to come home to
0	whereas if trunc y trunc your course is kind of terrible
0	yeah
0	mm pause dur short like pause dur short the first few weeks i thought that i got on with flatmates pause dur short but now like looking back i really didn t
0	cos like pause dur short yeah i mean they were old for me and they were trunc s trunc like yeah
0	they just weren t like pause dur short yeah
0	they didn t seem to like talk about anything except like pause dur short i dunno pause dur short just really trivial stuff
0	i mean didn t you say they weren t very nice to you like when they found out about the stuff
0	yeah
0	vocal desc sigh
0	understand and they were trunc s trunc like
0	yeah pause dur short yeah i think the only things keeping me here pause dur short are this flat
0	yeah
0	because pause dur short i guess with student pause dur short unclear keeping unclear yeah
0	really angry at myself i expect pause dur short at not pause dur short you know trying harder
0	i mean do you think if you went home for a short time do you think you d feel better or not
0	erm
0	yeah i dunno pause dur short but but then again i did feel like that a couple of weeks ago so
0	no yeah yeah i was thinking
0	no trunc d trunc absolutely like
0	yeah pause dur short but i just worry about like pause dur short going home and getting a job and that s it and that s all i d have to do for the rest of my life cos i wouldn t
0	no yeah it d be a very unclear final unclear decision
0	i envy people who can just go travelling
0	er who have money yeah i know
0	yeah
0	have to pay my phone bill and just stuff like that like
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	cos you know the reason we re at uni is to avoid that
0	prospect like it s to get a degree and have that instead of just having to get job after job
0	mm
0	vocal desc sigh it s just yeah it s just really scary vocal desc laugh
0	scary thing
0	it is something like
0	as shitty trunc a trunc
0	cos yeah do you think
0	cos i enjoy pause dur short trunc o trunc some parts of it like pause dur short well not i don t know
0	i don t pause dur short yeah
0	mm
0	is a better word
0	is that how you feel about it
0	mm pause dur short i mean but you re still important
0	you re unclear obviously a lot unclear pause dur short you ve still got many qualities just as much as she pause dur short does you know
0	cos maybe difference with her is that she can kind of pause dur short see her qualities maybe like she s learned pause dur short or maybe she s just that type of person who s just quite aware of pause dur short what she s good at and for some people they just can t see the good in themselves you know
0	vocal desc laugh
0	she used to say that sort of thing to me
0	her pause dur short i would be quite er quite nice to be a counsellor actually
0	there s cbt
0	that go to counsellors have a range of problems despite having like one trunc d trunc a couple of disorders pause dur short it s like a range of
0	but i d i d enjoy doing that
0	you d be making a difference
0	difference to you like pause dur short and i think having ones that are quite like particularly when you re young young counsellors as well like
0	yeah
0	mm
0	i suppose how long does it actually take to get into that kind of pause dur short job cos
0	so they re gonna pause dur short yeah
0	one year full time pause dur short that s not very long
0	possibly pause dur short which i won t
0	let s face it
0	yeah but what if you re living in halls
0	loads well not loads of people but some people do pause dur short yeah like they pause dur short they probably would tend to offer you like pause dur short erm pause dur short like studio pause dur short apartments have you seen those
0	not that i m planning on getting pregnant while i m that would not be a good idea
0	vocal desc laugh
0	there may be a minimum age limit interviews and written assessments pause dur long oh so once you re qualified you may choose to work privately or voluntarily within the nhs pause dur short wait so it can t just be a year that s ridiculous
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	but i wouldn t make it expensive
0	only if it affordable cos i know how annoying it is to not be able to afford a good counsellor
0	cos you could do a range because i know somebody like pause dur short i trunc w trunc i used to speak to one of my counsellors about the sort of stuff she did cos i was quite interested in it pause dur short and she did like a range like i remember i trunc g trunc i went in to her room in her house pause dur short and she had like shelves of like pause dur short squishy balls and toys and i asked what they were for and she was like oh some of the children that i like pause dur short that i trunc h trunc with trauma like trauma therapy and stuff with some of the kids like pause dur short they kind of come in and play
0	which is nice isn t it pause dur short like
0	yeah it s funny though i ve never asked her actually cos we re not as close as me and my other auntie but one of my aunties is actually a counsellor now like
0	mm
0	yeah pause dur short mm
0	you could be a good counsellor i think
0	she d probably have a unclear lot of things unclear pause dur short i don t think so i just need a job really i just don t vocal desc laugh unclear really know what else unclear
0	yeah you are though
0	it is pause dur short i think it s an underestimated compliment
0	like you are a good listener
0	you re a good talker you re interesting like i like the stuff that you say
0	yeah
0	they re so archaic and old like
0	you don t want
0	and that like you wouldn t want that pause dur short i love trunc th trunc we need to watch that film at some point
0	angelina jolie is so good in that film
0	yeah i know the blonde it looks so good pause dur long
0	what really how did she die
0	yeah pause dur short she died really young pause dur short i can t remember i think it was pause dur short drugs pause dur short possibly
0	or a car crash pause dur short one of the things pause dur short but yeah she was like pause dur short not even thirty i think
0	i know
0	she was in like some of my favourite nineties films vocal desc laugh
0	didn t her dad like sexually abuse her and he gave her like pause dur short i thought her dad like
0	like she had a erm pause dur short what s it called pause dur short erm pause dur short electra is it electra for dad yeah cos oedipus is mum pause dur short yeah an electra complex
0	have you read the book
0	it s really trunc goo trunc i trunc n trunc i need to finish it actually but
0	and so sad
0	and it kind of scares me sometimes it s just like oh the film wasn t like this i m vocal desc laugh a bit scared now pause dur short what have i what have i got myself into like
0	it s like unclear
0	like you he he has trunc acc trunc he has succeeded the author pause dur short in making teenagers feel like pause dur short yeah

0	vocal desc laugh
0	like
0	like third hand before i knew you vocal desc laugh
0	yeah she is cool she s cool
0	unclear go for a problem unclear pause dur short er
0	unclear cos unclear pause dur short no that wouldn t really work
0	between the rich and the poor pause dur short like like it s like the highest
0	that too
0	yeah
0	more income than sixty percent of pause dur short the rest of everyone

0	but that s what they re saying with this austerity measure thing like pause dur short we re just gonna cut everyone s pay pause dur short erm pause dur short but the rich pause dur short don t lose any money pretty much

0	like do you know what i mean
0	a lot of people go through their entire lives doing nothing that you ve already done

0	did you feel quite upset this morning
0	and i said i mean i m the last thing i said to her so i told him is well you know whether if you can if you trunc c trunc if you can t be friend then say you can t be a friend
0	mm
0	that s it
0	yeah
0	but if you er if you do wanna be a friend then you have to be a trunc f trunc a full friend pause dur short not just deciding what you can and you re capable of pause dur short cos this whole thing of i m i m weak and not good enough
0	mm
0	yeah
0	is a pile of shit
0	yeah
0	just because you don t keep in touch with anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name
0	doesn t make you a crap friend pause dur short you know
0	i mean it s like we said yesterday pause dur short like this is the point pause dur short if you can identify that you let people down why not do something about it
0	yeah
0	it s not like you re eighty and you can t change and you think oh i really like i regret
0	mm
0	mm
0	i took him back up to anon type place to a gig and surprised him pause dur short i arranged all his friends to be there
0	he d like he had the same part time job growing up
0	mm
0	mm
0	so he did leave his friends then pause dur short but he lived near them so it wasn t an issue
0	went to hnd but then obviously you don t then leave college and go to uni pause dur short cos it s hnd conversion and everyone stays in the same stream so
0	until he moved down here with me he d never his choices consciously or not had never put him in a position where he d have to work on friendships pause dur short cos everyone s
0	mm
0	but he said some really awful things liz pause dur short really awful things
0	yeah
0	i don t know why
0	it s
0	yeah
0	yeah

0	yeah
0	it s just daft
0	and just held it there pause dur short and i was just like uh pause dur short it s so hard having you that close all the time
0	that s i mean it s really unfair of him pause dur short really unfair
0	i think pause dur short because he knows he knows how you feel about him pause dur short and he s making it worse
0	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short i mean it s hard for him obviously pause dur short because you know you ve gone from being in a relationship to just being friends pause dur short and you know there was that grey area for a few months afterwards pause dur short but really like that s not okay pause dur short like as nice as it is for you
0	and you don t want him to stop doing it because it s very lovely pause dur short like that s what s confusing you

0	a living one
0	i love the natural history museum pause dur short i love the dinosaurs
0	oh god pause dur short mm
0	not as awful as the africa thing
0	i thought we had you know some bones pause dur short and you might ve found like a couple of bones that would make a leg pause dur short and a couple from another dinosaur that would make something else pause dur short i didn t realize we had actual full skeletons of one thing
0	cos all the dinosaurs would ve eaten them pause dur short cos they would ve been stupid pause dur short and dinosaurs would ve won pause dur short um er not one part of me s ever doubted them pause dur short but i suppose that s because i grew up so close to anon type place relatively trunc spea trunc like compared to you
0	in a day pause dur short so we yeah er i never considered it wasn t real
0	er er yeah pause dur short i mean er we er obviously i grew up in the countryside pause dur short even though i didn t think i did pause dur short cos i grew up in a village pause dur short and i would always saying to my mum mum when i grow up i wanna live in the country pause dur short and she was like uh huh pause dur short she d obviously trunc g trunc lived in anon type place for like forty years pause dur short she was like you are living in the country fyi pause dur short and in my head i pictured the country as like a cottage in a field and not being able to see anybody else
0	that was the country
0	absolutely obsessed pause dur short and when i went round on friday night he was like oh i ve found a house that s in the same road um as the house we lived in in anon type place road in er anon type place pause dur short and i was like oh and i in my head i was like god i bet that s worth a few bob pause dur short cos when we went back to visit it a couple of years ago and it s the same woman living there

0	so that s pretty sweet
0	mm
0	that s still forty grand
0	mm
0	and when i leave the navy and then they give me money for trunc l trunc for towards my new life
0	that s amazing
0	if you wanted to if you wanted to i mean the best er particularly because when you come back you you know you ll want to move out and you ll be i mean in in theory you won t have a fella or something because you ll have been on living on a boat pause dur short but who knows you might
0	er pause dur short vocal desc cough but it d be it d be great if you just bought a flat out in
0	and that s it s pretty exciting place to live pause dur short i er i know anon nametype f type name quite likes it pause dur short but um and then trunc t trunc take a view on it pause dur short cos when you meet someone and when you wanna have kids you might feel differently pause dur short because it s probably worth living in london just yourself
0	that d be a bit extreme
0	i always am
0	like anon nametype m type name s like that

0	yeah pause dur short but did they not sort of self reflect and think well possibly if she d had a bit of family love and support she might ve
0	yeah apparently not pause dur short but at the time because they re adults and you re not
0	so had you gone through clearing
0	mm
0	and how ridiculous is this the entry requirements were er straight bs
0	so i called up pause dur short said you know not got my grades pause dur short got four ds pause dur short but obviously they only want three cs pause dur short so i wasn t very far off points wise
0	mm
0	yeah
0	shit man
0	yeah
0	that ll be really interesting pause dur short and i was like fine whatever pause dur short i just wanna go and get pissed
0	unclear it s straight as pause dur short if you wanna do anything arts based
0	completely ridiculous pause dur short cos she didn t enjoy it at all pause dur short which is why she s changed now pause dur short um pause dur short it took her to fail her first year for them to let her change it though
0	wow
0	so it beat anon type place pause dur short i don t know how
0	fuck me
0	so she can t do both

0	yeah
0	you know and it s trunc n trunc you know to be able to have a frank conversation about it she needs to say you know it was either it was really hard for me or i can t believe i did it or whatever

0	mm
0	oh yeah pause dur short that s right

0	so if i zoom out a fraction basically can we that there is anon type place international pause dur short that
0	obviously
0	got it
0	because we could get a cab in or
0	or a train in
0	train just as easily
0	yep
0	party bus
0	i um
0	because we might find that on those dates
0	shift new singing unclear shift new normal
0	maybe it s no difference
0	mm pause dur short yeah
0	then anon nametype n type name can get us trunc pr trunc the sales director can get us free parking and lounge entry for like a tenner per person pause dur short so you get there you get free drinks
0	mm
0	go now pause dur short think you d better go now
0	it s not horrendous pause dur short we d be back for kind of eight o clock
0	you don t wanna be doing that
0	that s a bit of a killer
0	mm
0	that is right stansted to anon type place pause dur short yeah so we would fly in i ve lost it here
0	okay
0	or in fact before we do that
0	mm
0	mm
0	for employer rate please
0	um pause dur short pretty cushty now pause dur short i mean the killer is that you and i both know
0	mm
0	mhm
0	mhm
0	in fact if he doesn t tell trunc ka trunc if it wasn t for the fact that he hated anon nametype f type name
0	mhm pause dur short tut pause dur short nineteenth of may
0	is there any word on the take over
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm
0	oh yeah
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but you know pause dur short anon type place pause dur short we don t want the airport do we
0	vocal desc laugh
0	people call up and enquire and i have to ask them a million times what the hell date they asked for
0	yeah pause dur short um there s this one at twenty five pause dur short there s wherever this is on the m at eighteen
0	it ll load the map to give us where they are pause dur short please do pause dur short still doing
0	so they don t have anon type place then they just have holiday inn
0	anon type place s usually around forty
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm
0	but they re better than a travelodge premier inn
0	mm
0	their staff weren t half as good as our staff
0	um pause dur short and i didn t wanna cause too much of a stink cos i thought like
0	yeah
0	maybe we should just put these in the map
0	er click on it pause dur short mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short it s got it s got a postcode has it
0	we could just put the address in
0	and they thought that i was paying extra for being able to go in the club lounge
0	mm
0	twenty miles is that
0	about half an hour
0	mm
0	number one s twenty five pounds pause dur short number two is eighteen pounds
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	no it s this one
0	mm pause dur short sweetcorn
0	let s
0	so that trunc f trunc that s from oh that s from dunmurry mm pause dur short fourteen minutes in a cab to the wedding
0	uh uh pause dur short miles
0	we could get a train
0	mm
0	so it s twenty trunc m trunc at the longest twenty three minutes here pause dur short in a cab
0	yeah
0	as opposed to cab from here to airport
0	on the way in
0	yeah pause dur short we ll probably
0	yeah pause dur short cab it in
0	and then get the train out pause dur short cos we ll have time
0	and if you you know you can spend time getting ready can t you
0	oh does it
0	twelve thirty
0	cos by the time we get out of the airport it ll be ten
0	so we can request early check in
0	but really probably don t wanna check in cos er checking in at early check in will be twelve
0	will they mind us checking in at at eleven o clock or twelve o clock p m
0	after we
0	but they shouldn t really care
0	in under my buttocks
0	it s only fifty quid or trunc for trunc forty five quid
0	mm
0	cos you never know pause dur short we might look at this in a week and it might ve gone up pause dur short might ve doubled
0	yeah pause dur short i think we should just do it pause dur short just get on board and do it
0	or
0	i think this is probably the better option pause dur short because then we don t have to worry about getting into london and getting out again pause dur short i think either way
0	oh yeah
0	we should we should book into
0	mm
0	well that that s a brilliant idea pause dur short well in that case if i pay on trunc m trunc if i pay if i pay on my trunc car trunc if i pay er pay on your card i can give you cash pause dur short cos i ve got loads of cash that you ve just given me pause dur short and my worry is that i m so bad with money that i ve got loads of cash on me then i spend it
0	yep
0	leave the next day at one thirty
0	yeah
0	that s the good thing about it trunc bei trunc that coming back on a saturday pause dur short cos basically sunday s a write off
0	sunday s a complete write off
0	dead pause dur short dead pause dur short and also this way with leaving on the friday i don t have to take the thursday off work if i don t want to
0	mm
0	well first thing probably pause dur short i ll um i ll find out about unclear about the parking and stuff as well
0	she said it started off being ninety pounds a night and i was like holy jesus that s ridiculous pause dur short and then she said oh no ellen her sister s just booked her room it s actually a hundred and thirty pounds pause dur short like it looks beautiful like we ll have a look at it in a minute pause dur short like it s a really nice place to get married
0	mm
0	but to insist on people staying there and it be a hundred and thirty pounds pause dur short so even if both of us stayed there like could you imagine if i didn t have a plus one i d have to pay that on my own
0	mm
0	i reckon i can rock my er trunc f trunc maxi dress
0	so they don t know what i usually wear or whether this is out of character or not pause dur short which is a lovely
0	boring pause dur short not at that time in the morning
0	i ve got travel insurance
0	like
0	yeah pause dur short it does
0	do we have a promotional code
0	do you want me to google it and find out if we have one
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh i hope we can get it pause dur short that d be good pause dur short because even if we are trunc b trunc getting taxis it s not gonna be that much pause dur short it s not gonna equal sixty five pounds a night is it
0	no
0	yep pause dur short yep yep yep
0	mm
0	we ll get a cab from the hotel but then we can get train

0	thirty quid a day
0	job done
0	and vocal desc laugh thirty pound by four people pause dur short if you think about it this way it s cheaper for us to go to belfast than it is to go into cambridge for the night out

0	i only saw a small part of it pause dur short but basically he was saying that um at the moment three percent of the population are muslim
0	mhm
0	um pause dur short and they weren t concentrating i mean the problem was that he was broadening what he was saying pause dur short he was being a bit too general pause dur short but he basically showed you a lot of footage of extreme muslims protesting in the streets pause dur short um pause dur short saying how gays were wrong and this and that was wrong pause dur short and you should follow muslim and the trunc b trunc it showed you the real extreme muslims

0	mm
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm
0	mm
0	the conversion rate is much smaller pause dur short and so he said the reason why we re campaigning against it is not campaigning against a race but rather campaigning against a religion which would encourage people to do that pause dur short and the guy that was filming was saying but it s not er a religion that s encouraging people to do that pause dur short it s the people pause dur short like
0	yeah
0	mm
0	that he s actually done any proper research pause dur short because really he
0	i mean the fact is

0	yeah
0	it s it s all dangerous
0	it s all that s the thing

0	mhm
0	any of the other any of the other consonants really
0	i m busy pause dur short far too busy to be er pronouncing words
0	yeah
0	don t get that
0	stupid derby
0	or like coventry or something pause dur short people with ridiculously stupid accents
0	but i think he moved away when he was like six or something
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and she refused because vocal desc laugh it wasn t in her language pause dur short vocal desc laugh because it was sent in english
0	she said no fuck off
0	well that s interesting pause dur short because the the language of wales is trunc w trunc is english so pause dur short trunc w trunc that s not really a line of defence really
0	yeah pause dur short so she said no pause dur short my first language is welsh pause dur short i can t understand this
0	really
0	why do they hate us
0	and er they were saying that at that time i dunno whether they ever did it pause dur short they wanted to change every single one of the road signs pause dur short at the moment it says english first and then welsh underneath
0	mm
0	millions of pounds pause dur short but they wanna do it because they don t want the english on the trunc s trunc trunc roa trunc on the road signs
0	really
0	mm
0	that the anon type place ruffians awful chav people hate pause dur short but in actual fact they work fricking hard
0	like
0	mm
0	mm
0	all through the estate pause dur short and then drop them back back excuse me back off about six half six at night pause dur short so they worked a long day pause dur short twelve hour shifts
0	is a bit like where i lived when i was at uni
0	we re a small island
0	i mean if it s a trade that we need i think that s a good way of judging it
0	yeah
0	cos we didn t have enough
0	well that s um so that s certainly how australia do it isn t it
0	is it
0	um pause dur short i d have to be sponsored by a profession there pause dur short like by an industry there
0	yeah pause dur short you can do that with america can t you
0	yeah
0	do it
0	yeah
0	uh
0	but it s a bit harsh pause dur short like it s quite quite a quite a way of doing it
0	work on a farm
0	therefore everything should be in english
0	er the trunc majori trunc it s has to be about the majority of the people pause dur short i mean it could be that in fifty years time the national religion might be muslim
0	mm
0	yeah
0	choose pause dur short yeah
0	i don t really agree with that pause dur short i think just let people migrate the way they want to pause dur short well and that would help the situation between having a really rich west and a really poor east
0	yeah
0	no er
0	religion separate to trunc s trunc to the state
0	i mean they have a thing where in any school any government any it s anybody employed by the government pause dur short so police teachers all that shabaz
0	mm
0	mm
0	that s what they do in america isn t it
0	mm
0	they re quite religious pause dur short so i think they actually have quite an impact pause dur short because you ve got this friction between state law and federal law pause dur short so the law that relates to the country as a whole and laws that relate to just a state pause dur short i think talking to an american person recently they were saying that they don t imagine that the usa will stay united
0	no
0	it s like it s like its er its own continent essentially is probably what s
0	cos you just can t you just can t create laws for all of them pause dur short they won t come in line
0	if you think about the usa er um and compare it to europe
0	yeah
0	for example pause dur short so that s probably what would happen pause dur short it would become a continent as opposed to a country pause dur short and each of the states would be its own country
0	central america pause dur short which is you know mexico and some other countries
0	which is er all that crap before brazil
0	my geography s appalling
0	yeah at least you know where things are pause dur short roughly
0	roughly pause dur short very very roughly pause dur short but as demonstrated my geography of the uk pretty bad
0	it s probably wise
0	what s a submarium
0	er it s like er an aquarium but you go underneath it pause dur short so like glass above you and loads of fish and shark stuff up there
0	yeah pause dur short you just
0	walk through the little tunnel pause dur short and you can see all the stuff
0	cromer
0	it s not far from norwich pause dur short we used to go to
0	i ve heard of this pause dur short i ve seen brochures for it and everything
0	it s really nice pause dur short really trunc pret trunc like er just a nice seaside town pause dur short it s really nice
0	seaside is it
0	like granny
0	yep
0	got a nice case of cromer crabs on the beach pause dur short so that was nice pause dur short and then er went to the aquarium pause dur short we walked in and we were looking at all the ticket prices pause dur short and this was er this was when we were at uni so we were all students looking for student prices pause dur short and i went first and went trunc t trunc to the girl at the till and said oh can i have i was looking at the ticket prices pause dur short i was trying to work it out pause dur short there wasn t a student concession rate pause dur short so i said
0	no
0	and it goes down pause dur short and you walk through and you see all the whole er shabaz pause dur short er but there s places in it that s just black pause dur short and it s only crustaceans pause dur short all the trunc st trunc crazy stuff that lives at the very bottom of the sea
0	that looks like fossils
0	okay pause dur short that s quite cool
0	seven miles i mean er how far away s anon type place fifteen miles
0	right
0	what do you even do with that money er you that trunc e trunc you can solve all of the medical issues in the trunc worl trunc you could like find er cures for cancer and aids pause dur short he
0	do you know like when the rockets blast off into space and they go and put so that what he wants to find is the rocket that was attached to the shuttle that went up for the apollo mission pause dur short you know pause dur short buzz aldrin pause dur short neil armstrong pause dur short walking on the moon pause dur short nineteen sixty nine pause dur short he wants to find that rocket pause dur short which he thinks he s located
0	what are you doing
0	what what are you gonna trunc g trunc what are you gonna gain from that
0	i think pause dur short i might be wrong pause dur short but i think it might be philanthropic pause dur short only because it s the last vowel isn t it pause dur short i think trunc w trunc in english we pronounce the last vowel in the world as the stress pause dur short er in the word as the stress
0	it s er
0	oh
0	but it s more to do with the way you put the stress on the first
0	it s the second to last one pause dur short it s the same as spanish
0	yeah
0	it does usually change
0	yeah pause dur short absolutely pause dur short so good luck with that
0	is it the judderman
0	yes pause dur short mm
0	yeah
0	whether that s true or not i don t know pause dur short but er the advert was dredging things out of the sea pause dur short so you d see they d you d see like a couple walking along the sea front pause dur short and it was you know shot in you know it was shot true to life pause dur short but obviously they d added the cgi effects over the top pause dur short because there were like gold pennies flying out of the sea pause dur short and like ships rising out of the water pause dur short and you know like submarines pause dur short and all kinds of stuff coming out of the sea pause dur short and it does make you wonder pause dur short like if you could actually dredge the sea
0	what the hell are you gonna find
0	loads of shit
0	all kinds of carry on
0	yeah
0	and it s fucking massive pause dur short like he reckons these rockets um that um you know became detached from the er er apollo shuttle are fourteen thousand feet underwater pause dur short below sea level pause dur short that s fucking
0	p h i l a n t h r o p i c
0	yeah i mean i imagine the salt s eroded er the metal pause dur short so i don t know what kind of condition they re even gonna be in pause dur short but he hasn t said where they are pause dur short apparently it was on one of his it was on his website that that s what he s gonna do pause dur short but
0	unclear
0	yeah pause dur short probably not
0	thirty thousand and eleven pause dur short like two thousand pause dur short how many is he er how many does he want
0	vocal desc laugh ten thousand
0	twenty two thousand
0	cos he s a fucking weirdo pause dur short and he s gonna trunc l trunc put it in a cave pause dur short so i think that unclear
0	ah

0	oh my god i think i d die if i moved it s like you know anon nametype m type name
0	oh anon nametype f type name oh i ve missed you
0	not that i m superficial or anything
0	no but a man has to look you know presentable
0	so
0	yeah what was the
0	yeah yeah i told him obviously to back off it was really inappropriate and then last week i don t know if i told you this he sent me a message being like oh yeah i m sorry i haven t replied to you i m moving into our apartment
0	yeah and i was just like okay and then he s like yeah i m moving in with my girlfriend and like and he was like oh yeah i told her she was really brave and i was like some would say brave others would say stupid
0	each to their own and that was you know was the last thing he said cos he was like we re not all cynical like you anon nametype f type name i was like i m not cynical i just it s to nothing to do with cynicism i just don t trust people who give me a reason not to and i just left it at that cos it s basically just like i don t trust you
0	i don t yeah i can t believe she moved from australia she s moving in with him like i don t know
0	it just it just makes me feel a bit embarrassed for her
0	but long enough to be able to see through things
0	it s long enough to pick up a vibe
0	yeah
0	and i was like do i send a message because i ve never gone a time without sending a message but i don t want to
0	but
0	we ve both kind of drawn a line and been like no i m never going back there again i think like
0	on yeah and in harper lee s book it was in like her new one it s really good erm there s one line that says erm the other woman has turned into the psychiatrist s couch or men make men make the other woman a psychiatrist couch and i was like
0	just yeah it s like yeah i always would kind of like be interested in what s going on in his life you know like
0	and this other girl in my friendship group was like really outrageously flirting with him and i realised if i had really liked him it would have bothered me and it didn t really bother me i was a little annoyed but not like
0	massively yeah like you know if you really fancy somebody
0	who is that yeah
0	yeah exactly it s really weird cos anon nametype f type name fancies this guy who has a girlfriend and stuff
0	and i was like ah but that s the kind of things you do if you really like someone isn t it like
0	yeah yeah yeah see that s okay i i stayed behind for dt coursework sessions just so i could talk to the guy that i kind of liked
0	yep
0	yep
0	how long is the work of it s for the summer isn t it yeah
0	you know what
0	lovely but flaky she s got such a level head on her shoulders
0	cos she thought about doing graphic design and then a couple of weeks ago she turned round to me and she went no i think i want to do like european law with french or something
0	wow
0	and i was like wow that s a bit of a change but what is it that you know and she s kind of like well i need to get these grades and i was like well have you looked at these unis or have you googled this search term or this search term and i was sat with her with all the university stuff and it was really it was really good and she has got a really level head like level head on her shoulders which is really good but i have no idea what s going on with anon nametype f type name so basically
0	but they got back together after their big break up and what have you and blah blah blah
0	and then all of a sudden she s she through facebook reconnects with this guy who was her friend from school
0	okay
0	major yeah
0	but it s like i was like i was thinking it s such a it s such a hard thing if you ve got like a man and this is the case i was thinking this earlier like and one of the other girls that i went to uni with absolutely stunningly beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful but they can never find the right guy because the guys that throw themselves at them and they re so adoring of them that they will mistake that for love or something different and then you know it s always hard to tell but yeah so i i don t particularly know what s going on cos she just went anon nametype f type name i m so tired and started crying and went i ll talk to you about it later i was like alright you know where i am but you know obviously she won t come and talk to me about it
0	oh yeah if he s staying over yeah
0	this is what i was thinking i was like you know but i can understand it though because you know she is beautiful she s very talkative she s very sociable she s very chatty she s very amiable and she knows how to work people
0	yeah
0	you know she was finally starting to get on her feet like she was made redundant and whatever
0	yeah yeah yeah she s working at the university and that s going really well but
0	yeah
0	so we ll just we ll just see i hope she s okay but it s probably just one of those things that ll blow over maybe it s not maybe it will be but i ve trunc be trunc i ve been through the waves enough times
0	drama
0	is it all good
0	but erm
0	you know cos it s the kind of thing that like oh this is was different a lot of the time it wasn t like i was being clingy but i was constantly aware that at some point anon nametype m type name might turn around and not want to be with me especially when i got really quite erm
0	that looks amazing thank you
0	oh my god this looks so good
0	yeah
0	it was like on friday night when i went out and got with anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name was like why didn t you go back with him i was like because i was going back with you and she was like what do you mean i was like well i was i planned to go back with you
0	yeah
0	so it s what you will do
0	oh i will
0	i m going to anon type place yeah sorry it s this cough i put a lot of salt on
0	mm
0	but you know with an hour it s trunc on trunc like it s not too far away is it
0	my clan like william wallis
0	mm twinny is doing well
0	mm what what s twinny up to
0	mm
0	yeah just lots of salt
0	mm i also trunc l trunc trunc fa trunc i also love the fact that i still get you on chat
0	i know i m like who cares mm yeah anon nametype m type name wanders round our office now
0	oh
0	so i don t understand how that rumour can be true
0	anon nametype f type name
0	wow sounds like an important title
0	how s it going guys
0	really pause dur long
0	we don t have as much contact with him as like the er like anon nametype f type name or
0	mm
0	what like an outdoor one
0	mm
0	oh cool so erm where you re sitting in the same place aren t you you didn t move in the restructure
0	no no by everyone else who did
0	like media research and marketing design are still in the same place as well
0	mm do you talk to the team much
0	mm yeah i still contact i speak to anon nametype m type name a bit cos i also have him on chat so i occasionally apparently anon nametype m type name is in a relationship with this guy so that s good
0	i dunno just a guy she met i think he s quite old but
0	oh okay
0	what about the ones in anon type place
0	i m trunc so trunc i have literally annihilated this
0	i didn t even think i was this hungry pause dur short so
0	i can t go out massively socialising
0	yeah with all of us awesome people descending upon you pause dur long
0	me
0	boyf
0	i still get have to get used to that
0	the boyf pause dur short i think i have mini panic attacks every time i think of being in a relationship i m twenty three i can t deal with it
0	whenever relationships are never trunc per trunc it s people who think that relationships should be perfect always the ones who are complete like morons
0	no
0	it can it s more you know and it actually it s better to see people when you want to see them rather than when you feel like you have to
0	yeah cos then it becomes an obligation
0	like i erm it was really good actually like anon nametype f type name my housemate and like my best friend from school we obviously live together and like i we re having a girls night next friday we re going into town we re going out to dinner and she s going out into town with her some work colleagues
0	what would you do you know you don t want to get back into that rut that you were before when you were going out and then you broke up and you kind of like she became really sociable again cos she didn t have a boyfriend and then the moment they got together she suddenly was like no no no i m back with him i don t need my friends and i was like
0	and he said the and this is the thing he said the exact same thing not that either of us felt specifically but we were just like to be honest when we when we came into this neither of us wanted to you know give up our lives that we were having yes maybe less gallivanting for me would be good
0	yeah
0	like you know and it s unclear like you know my auntie and uncle in anon type place i haven t seen well i haven t seen them in ages cos obviously when i was staying in anon type place i was staying with anon nametype m type name because you know he was a bit like oh why would you stay with them and not me but then he kind of understands it s like but they re my family like i have to see them
0	and i went vocal desc cough so i i wasn t after you rang i was feeling fine and then all of a sudden it was like oh not feeling so good
0	or not to push through or not to do things i m really hypersensitive to when other people say it so i was like don t like especially when it s things like your back i m just like no cos if you ruin if you ruin that you could be ruined for months
0	like the other day i genuinely couldn t even like bend down to like shave my legs it was horrible and like putting socks on like oh my god i never thought putting socks on would be a problem but it hurts so much
0	no but that s what i mean you can t take that for granted it s just like you know i knew that you wouldn t make anything of it unless it was particularly bad like for you to ring me i knew you were ringing me because you were like i haven t heard from you or i rang you i was like sorry my phone was on silent and upstairs i m terrible erm
0	you re getting better
0	as you can see by the empty plates it was good
0	a sample of everything
0	oh my god oh my word
0	things are a lot easier so you know
0	yeah
0	and then he
0	yeah exactly

0	i m a member of the victoria and albert museum you re member of the national trust together we re like the oldest weirdest people we re like the weirdest twenty three year olds
0	yeah

0	so many people said that to me i was like i went to this hollywood exhibition i went to this wedding dress exhibition i went to this couture icon mcqueen exhibition i went shoe exhibition you hear some people are like that s really cool other people are just like
0	really ooh
0	i love audrey hepburn it s like if i were audrey hepburn my life would be pretty much made like yeah
0	cos yeah you sent me that link they re extending it aren t they cos it s so popular
0	yeah but you can imagine how much money it actually costs to put on as well
0	yeah
0	for particular pieces it could be a but usually stuff is like on loan
0	it s such a i was trying to i was trying to explain to it my auntie cos like you know i was like i m no fashion expert but
0	yeah
0	yeah no people with people with prams there are so many places they should not go
0	definitely you should go but that with that many people
0	yeah
0	although my my auntie s niece on the other side of the family erm is doing her phd in fashion like kind of history more textile kind of thing
0	yeah
0	that had staged it all and then we just nicked the staging so it was the kind of thing that if we hadn t have done if they hadn t have done it first we would never have come up with something so elaborate and so dramatic in a way
0	no no it was that box of that box of curiosities at the end wasn t it that was intense that was you just walked in and it felt like a creepy children s film but beautiful at the same time
0	yeah that was stunning
0	yeah i don t think i would wear any of those clothes really but
0	yeah yeah so sad that something happened like cos he killed himself didn t he it s just
0	there you go i ll grab you a spoon
0	this looks amazing
0	i know i told you the desserts here were good
0	i did i was like give me pudding
0	er pause dur short you alright
0	mm
0	i do have netflix yeah
0	but it is really good
0	some of it pause dur short some of it is a bit far fetched
0	but it knows that
0	it s more that pause dur short so
0	okay the cappuccino
0	okay thank you
0	yeah which to be fair is what you would want really isn t it mm
0	so
0	yeah
0	yeah piper bores me
0	oh yeah
0	but that s what i like it s more the ensemble cast that are
0	i m really bad
0	it s because the berries are at the bottom and i don t want to be left with the berries at the end
0	that s why i m hunting for the berries
0	like er
0	you can t beat like coffee and dessert
0	not like a good coffee
0	no
0	yeah it really annoys me when someone offers me a coffee and then gives me like instant vocal desc laugh i drink instant coffee but
0	are you planning any summer holidays any summer trips with anon nametype m type name
0	erm if we re just in one place then that s fine but if we re in two places it makes more sense to take a longer break
0	and it depends if you get a new job
0	mm
0	mm yeah you don t want to end up in like them taking you to a like advantage of you again do you and like falling back into that like situation
0	cos technically i wouldn t really be reporting into to anyone that often anyway so
0	yeah
0	huh
0	where he moved to london
0	oh okay
0	obviously everybody likes you
0	or like you know it s the kind of thing or like all of them kind of emailed me and when unclear was like hey hope you re rested up and feeling better they don t know what was wrong but they know that
0	that something happened
0	they were really bizarre like he spent the whole time on his mobile she looked liked she d rather be like anywhere but here oh he s coming back wait there stop talking vocal desc laugh stop talking
0	did that cause a bit of tension between him and anon nametype m type name at all
0	and they all got told that they should apply for it and everyone was like meh erm anon nametype f type name is pregnant
0	no but it s fair enough after like five seven seven is it seven years
0	no the same salary kind of thing
0	i don t you re not happy and it like you obviously now you re getting a bit better and you were worked too hard but if you were crying in a car because you didn t want to go back to work you should not be spending your twenties crying in a car hating your job
0	yeah of course you do yeah
0	and it s one of the things that i m like right okay you ve got this restructure but what are you wanting me to do because i will tell you flat out if it s not if it s too much
0	yeah you ve done this to me
0	you re the idiots who ve done it
0	yeah it s not all on you yeah
0	but it s waiting for that right opportunity to come along the er the trunc mar trunc the marketing execs library job looks good but i m i wouldn t feel right applying for a job when i m on sick leave or when i m just coming back from sick leave
0	yeah of course
0	no
0	you ve learnt from it and you re sorted
0	you know if i were going for any job like supermarket retail office you know temp job
0	testing
0	yes
0	there is yes
0	i think it could be the tempest
0	cheers good throwing
0	saying i never win
0	yeah
0	and then you erm practice it in different places so that you er you get a you have passion for it and you apply the skill that you ve learnt motor with passion and interest and perseverance and that s how
0	yeah
0	yeah uhu
0	better than other people is winning for you
0	how does one win
0	sorry
0	i was half expecting that to be a anon nametype m type name original i was like yes preach it buddy vocal desc laugh
0	well you you get you learn the skill practice it so that it s a motor programme
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh well what is
0	what what is happiness it s so intangible that it s irrelevant is that
0	vocal desc laugh
0	not how i become happy i mean the form of happiness happiness is a state of being how do i learn the ability to become happy as a motor skill
0	i think you need to er glean and unclear nice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	erm
0	with the forehand
0	and then but you you see it looks different for other people so obviously
0	how
0	yes
0	vocal desc laugh that would be an incredible tennis player
0	there s a girl in my er in my literature class
0	there s a girl in my er english class whose surname is anon nametype n type name
0	to be a literature student
0	yeah
0	and then practice it in everyday life so maybe the skill that you ve learnt from other people that happiness is to live in the moment
0	yeah
0	enjoying the simple things of life maybe you could pick that up from someone so then what you need to do is then practice that
0	every day erm once you ve practiced it it becomes a motor neuron so that by trunc m trunc not trunc mot trunc a motor programme
0	forearm forehand
0	that was nice trunc fore trunc forearm hit then vocal desc laugh could you make a move for forearm pause dur short you definitely could
0	well you just have to
0	if you if you hold the back the bat the vocal desc laugh i may not know much about tennis vocal desc laugh but at least i know how to hold the bat is you hold it so you know how you normally hold it with the handle in your hand and the main body of the racquet further out above your hand
0	the head yeah
0	so the wrist
0	the elbow and the wrist
0	play some tennis oh man you know what i trunc wa trunc i wanna play some golf i really do i do love i do love a bit a golf i m a little i m a little overzealous sometimes with er with my shots my friends are lining up their their wedges and their five irons
0	not five iron they re wedges and it would probably be like an eight
0	eight iron probably
0	did it
0	even slightly
0	anon nametype m type name erm unclear and let go of the we were doing a last shot
0	vocal desc laugh
0	no way
0	and unclear jack unclear six selection
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh did you manage to get it back
0	cos it would have just it it trunc lit trunc landed on the on the er tee box so it s like vocal desc misc
0	you have yeah over to the right you have so trunc m trunc big and open space with so few people on but so many loose balls flying like at ridiculous paces with ridiculous force
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh no
0	and er he s we were on the green and we hear fore
0	yeah i mean like it does sound logical at first that the most statistically bad thing to do is to move about because that way you re erm you know increasing your area over the time between the ball being shouted as fore and the ball hitting something but in realistic terms the ball is only going to one place so
0	yeah
0	if you run about you re not unless the ball was also moving in the fourth dimension
0	vocal desc laugh
0	erm but yeah making yourself large is the worst thing to do facing the direction that the person so when they shout fore turning around is a bad idea getting hit in the back of the head s not good getting hit like in you know the forehead or the face
0	nice
0	tight throwing pause dur short erm i think i might pop to the loo in
0	mind if we take a break from this unclear some air
0	i m gonna be at this end now
0	yeah
0	yeah that s absolutely fine yeah tell you what i was thinking about there when you were throwing stones at me i was thinking
0	oh if you threw it hard yeah
0	oh sorry mate i didn t realise it was gonna
0	i went like that
0	yeah but it was unclear i dunno they unclear didn t hit me it wouldn t have stung as in like i wouldn t have been like ouch why but like it you would have felt it
0	okay yeah vocal desc laugh
0	to answer this question we found anon nametype m type name
0	anon nametype m type name finishes his exam and i m gonna see if he fancies some tennis
0	absolutely
0	i m absolutely not having you on the look on his face will
0	yeah
0	even better even better like to there and kick up a big fuss about the fact that it s his birthday and see if we can get it for free
0	which er which business would you own if you owned all of anon type place
0	oh that is a really good question erm what i d like to do really is consult the anon type place monopoly board cos that one
0	kind of the definitive thing
0	swalec would be quite good i think
0	trunc th trunc they advertise at anon type place they provide
0	yeah nice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah i think it would be cool to have ikea but i won t choose it purely because being ceo is way better like cos being store manager you re not your own boss you re just another
0	manager in an endless line of managers you ve just got someone else telling you do this and then you re telling other people do this
0	yeah
0	okay yeah
0	okay yeah yeah
0	whereas just working within retail i can tell you a lot of stuff that comes from up top and from managers is just completely useless
0	yeah cool place unclear too unclear
0	but it would not bring in the money that like anon type place would
0	okay yeah
0	anon nametype m type name made a good point with anon type place
0	no it s anon type place i do not care
0	okay that s a good er starting point for a discussion there what would you
0	i would bid for everything get all of the money in vocal desc laugh
0	have to spend money to get it vocal desc laugh sort of vocal desc laugh i guess erm i guess it s not really set up for cricket is it
0	no that s more anon type place
0	so rugby international rugby yes
0	it s a real win
0	demand for it for that stadium it s well known for it
0	yeah
0	so rugby definitely pause dur short i think football i would spend much less on
0	and not not much less than is currently being spent but much trunc le trunc much less than rugby
0	but i will have shares in the stadium so as a shareholder i would
0	er so for the international t twenties if we can host some trunc in trunc international t twenty that would be really good
0	anon type place
0	erm pause dur short yeah i mean i m just gonna have to say anon type place
0	vocal desc laugh
0	like professor anon nametype n type name pause dur long yeah what would you be
0	erm
0	not sure man
0	yeah
0	nice
0	as a director there or something
0	a director
0	so it s not it s not the only it s not the only interest in

0	yeah let s call it there
0	let s call it a day there i think
0	so at the beginning it s like it s the idea that pause dur short there was a great uprising
0	erm which was then stomped upon by the man
0	and they do the trunc hung trunc for like the idea is that like pause dur short the people in the districts the poor people in the districts pause dur short like you know they sort of convince them that the uprisings were wrong and you know and and everyone agrees that they were wrong
0	yeah
0	it s a bit stupid
0	yeah
0	who wrote this the very trunc sh trunc when she wrote it she was like i never heard of it and then you know trunc wh trunc once it had pretty much got to print someone was like aye or it was like someone in the er like the publishers was just like pause dur short this is exactly the same as battle royale vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	like like this is the exact same idea and like erm pause dur short like she s like oh i didn t know and
0	but pause dur short i don t know just like i suppose like she d done her own thing for it it s just
0	well it s it s written for a different audience
0	yeah vocal desc laugh no like thanks
0	yeah like at least when like like a hollywood
0	unclear
0	again a similar a similar concept
0	can t believe that isn t
0	and then but then your stick was like a sword that if you just got close enough to anyone

0	vocal desc laugh
0	mm pause dur short yeah i mean it was it was quite a fun format when it started pause dur short but yeah they re quite a way into it now so actually it s not quite as much fun pause dur short but yeah so masterchef is now my quality slash rubbish somewhere in the middle tv of choice pause dur short it s excellent

0	but
0	rowan atkinson is a bit of an interesting individual

0	as in he s trunc cl trunc he s very close friends with jeremy clarkson

0	they re they re not bullingdon are they vocal desc laugh i can just imagine them getting together and braying loudly about the plebs pause dur short vocal desc laugh actually clarkson s not particularly brayey pause dur short he s not posh pause dur short he s just just clarkson pause dur short but yeah rowan atkinson pause dur short i was er

0	vocal desc laugh oh right
0	cos er the idea is you sit in the centre pause dur short it s like a racing car
0	but no i think he had it for years
0	in that capacity you are entitled to legal protection against discrimination
0	and er you trunc d trunc
0	to the public
0	um it made her and it didn t necessarily make her you know it it s i mean do you select employee er er presenter on accounts they re attractive to look at um you could argue there s a part of that
0	but then well i think there s a difference again between selecting someone from a job and getting rid of them
0	it needs correcting but not postively discriminated against pause dur short but you
0	to be honest i don t know who it was pause dur short i didn t recognize the name or seen her pause dur short i ve never seen countryfile pause dur short vocal desc laugh there wasn t a picture in the article i read pause dur short vocal desc laugh um

0	leaving that aside
0	i don t understand how they weren t arrested
0	the buck stopped with lots of people i suspect
0	well yeah pause dur short but i think she was fairly high up and should ve um you know she was the person who was the natural choice to sort of step down pause dur short um but yeah that was quite bad pause dur short you wonder which actual kind of normal employee whose job whose job it was to check those pause dur short to let that go through
0	so people did actually sleep on it
0	but you d think andrew sachs would ve done something about it pause dur short i mean they didn t speak to him did they they left a message

0	yes i know pause dur short those er roundabout signs gave that away pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	well like i said i i assume there ll be
0	diverted traffic pause dur short yeah
0	if we
0	okay pause dur short in that case we wanna
0	we
0	which should be obvious
0	it it depends yeah it s probably gonna take us straight sort of up and it will just miss that one junction of the motorway

0	okay pause dur short so we want the a pause dur short yep pause dur short great pause dur short i like this er unclear anything else
0	so yeah we want
0	i like this part of the country you know pause dur short i do like the architecture and the
0	that yeah
0	well that takes them a really odd route for that diversion pause dur short very strange
0	well i suggest we don t refer to it as a t junction
0	that s very confusing of you
0	phones are perfect cos they re so low intensity light pause dur short it doesn t distract the driver
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short fair enough pause dur short it fine like i trunc c trunc you know i can see enough for this pause dur short it s just normally i m selecting quite odd menu options pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	you re not gonna accidentally shine it in my eyes
0	got that
0	there s two clubs in preston
0	cool
0	yeah
0	so that you so you go as a supporter pause dur short yeah pause dur short you need to be in the pause dur short ah no we trunc cou trunc we trunc cou trunc yeah in all fairness we could buy away tickets pause dur short but make sure you get sunderland tickets pause dur short cos the fans are segregated of course pause dur short and you need to be in the right end for your team pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	er pff
0	okay pause dur short well quickly navigate
0	i m hoping that we ll be able to join the a at the next junction down
0	diversion is right
0	so this is yeah pause dur short it s here pause dur short yeah pause dur short okay pause dur short so we just carry along er nothing happens for ages anyway on this road
0	so the a would ve taken us to the a is that it
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh close enough pause dur short you know pause dur short what more do you want
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	is it is friday a day when they do roadworks particularly or is it just
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh as in i i would ve thought that would be a daft choice pause dur short but maybe not
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh fair enough pause dur short okay pause dur short so er straight over here again pause dur long there wasn t even a diversion sign there
0	there was
0	okay pause dur short why aren t you overtaking
0	sorry pause dur short what were you saying
0	vocal desc laugh
0	luton s not very big
0	so nearly at middlesbrough
0	unclear railway station
0	anyway pause dur short so where were we er
0	it s the train line to middlesbrough pause dur short okay so um ah stockton on tees pause dur short so yeah so like i said i m gonna um base what we do next on what the diversion is pause dur short because um yeah i don t know trunc wheth trunc when the a opens back up if at all pause dur short if not we can just go straight onto the a pause dur short it s just a slightly longer less you know it s er it s roads like this rather than vocal desc laugh dual carriageway a pause dur short so we ll see what the diversion says
0	vocal desc laugh oh i m sorry pause dur short james may
0	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh don t let them pause dur short vocal desc laugh have rules about these things
0	that that trunc ps trunc yeah like that psychopathic delivery driver unclear cambourne
0	no i thought you meant on your way to work
0	in cambourne
0	not exactly a busy bit
0	indeed
0	so you could try that as a scientific experiment
0	true pause dur short vocal desc laugh oh yeah but trunc s trunc still for a small
0	how are we going this slowly
0	no i just think they re shit
0	and it s not just i don t want to drive quickly
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	this is quite a long diversion
0	it is
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh well we re nearly at the place where er it will sort of
0	vocal desc laugh god pause dur short vocal desc laugh diversion pause dur short get a boat
0	diversion pause dur short here s a pair of roller skates
0	yes
0	ah anon type place
0	well i i i assume that s the one the diversion one pause dur short that junction wasn t a roundabout here so
0	we needed a new map pause dur short yeah
0	vocal desc laugh not so much pause dur short no pause dur short tend not to have pedestrians anyway
0	that s a tattoo yeah
0	wow pause dur short this looks dire pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	it s not a village
0	yeah
0	so yeah so now we re heading north through anon type place pause dur short um and yeah we re gonna join the a again
0	oh pause dur short railway
0	that s either a level crossing or a fire station unclear
0	so er straight over
0	i m enjoying this pause dur short this is er unexpected
0	cos most people would be getting stressed in this situation
0	no no that s true pause dur short we don t
0	yes
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh pretty much pause dur short i love the way everything in um teeside is called something to do with durham
0	unclear
0	teeside s
0	vocal desc laugh
0	cos prior to the operation he was carrying round
0	an oxygen source
0	so i trunc thou trunc i guess he ll know pause dur short he ll have opinions on these things
0	fair enough
0	right
0	and then join it yeah
0	yes pause dur short for a very short period pause dur short at which point we ll join the a pause dur short um so maybe um six miles or so
0	yeah pause dur short okay so
0	straight over this one pause dur short and then yeah
0	and then this next one is right pause dur short yeah unclear pause dur long yeah
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh fair enough pause dur short vocal desc laugh we re first pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	hell yeah
0	or last pause dur short depending on which way you look at it pause dur short interesting night for an open top car
0	oh okay
0	that s what anon nametype f type name s got
0	vocal desc laugh oh yeah pause dur short fair enough pause dur short and it was also stupid o clock in the morning pause dur short bit nippy
0	was it
0	oh right
0	vocal desc laugh unclear
0	vocal desc laugh this was when i was um leaving theirs pause dur short and they were gonna bring all my stuff over pause dur short but i was coming to yours with a suitcase pause dur short which was gonna last me er the first few days in the house
0	yeah yeah pause dur short sorry pause dur short this was anon nametype f type name taking me from their house to anon type place station so i could go to work then go straight to yours then straight to the house
0	sorry
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	yarm pause dur short vocal desc laugh not yarp pause dur short yarm
0	it s got a very famous nightclub in yarm called tall trees pause dur short um
0	u n who s
0	yeah pause dur short thornaby pause dur short yeah pause dur short that s where my old maths teacher er my a level maths teacher lives
0	wow pause dur long yeah the conurbations round here are really weird pause dur short cos there s loads of pretty big cities all linked by a fairly good dual carriageway network
0	which you just don t get in the south pause dur short cos everything s round london which is linked by the m
0	yeah because it s
0	not directly between any of the other places
0	you just you need those roads pause dur short yeah
0	vocal desc laugh have you seen the um trunc y trunc vodafone yoda adverts
0	trunc w trunc we don t want to go there
0	sorry pause dur short yeah
0	trunc y trunc vodafone yoda
0	mm
0	ah
0	and so we wanna go north
0	before bit before
0	no
0	no
0	that s appallingly marked
0	which is quite cool pause dur short so what a stupid place to put a junction
0	um pause dur short er my dad s normally driving
0	yes
0	vocal desc laugh um i i m not to be honest i m not actually sure pause dur short about half an hour but
0	but like he s trunc d trunc does drive considerably slower pause dur short so er i can give them a ring and just say er they ll know exactly where we are
0	yeah
0	okay then pause dur short well um um yeah if you put them in that d be good pause dur short um um not not for you know um don t put them in straight away but um i dunno well but yeah we ll be
0	yeah pause dur short i can just imagine your mother nuking a pizza
0	okay pause dur short sorry
0	i did i trunc s trunc said don t put them in straight away pause dur short obviously pause dur short anyway pause dur short um pause dur short yeah that was fun pause dur short vocal desc laugh twenty two to sunderland
0	is this er a pizza delivery
0	oh right yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	i m extremely tired
0	but if we buy one trunc f trunc new film at fifteen quid a month that s
0	so we ll only buy stuff that we ve watched and really like
0	is that that park place unclear shopping centre
0	um the park place
0	oh herrington pause dur short no no no
0	yeah
0	no no pause dur short that s um that s unclear that s kind of in sunderland
0	oh no no that s in unclear that s um the other direction
0	i don t believe you sometimes pause dur short more specifically i don t believe i let you navigate
0	i if i m if i m if i m looking at a map and i ve found it and then i d tell you where it was
0	yeah
0	yeah exactly pause dur short so you ve got unclear
0	it s
0	incidentally er this was the right choice pause dur short this is a much quieter much nicer road
0	yeah pause dur long i wouldn t say this was an american anthem
0	right pause dur short um i m not gonna be exactly sure which junction it is to come off at pause dur short so you are gonna have to unclear
0	yeah pause dur short come off there
0	well exactly pause dur short i m sort of torn about whether it needs to be or not
0	mm
0	random sequence of sounds
0	okay pause dur short so if if but if it was a piece of music and you trunc o trunc and it was just yeah yeah yeah over and over again pause dur short there was no other word in it pause dur short that would basically be an instrumental
0	well unclear
0	mm pause dur short unclear business premises pause dur short no it s not
0	what unclear business premises
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah pause dur short looking forward to crashing out tonight i think
0	vocal desc laugh quite tricky pause dur short okay so maybe eight miles to our junction pause dur short so it s not far now
0	how do you know that
0	cos i ve just seen which junction we re at pause dur short and i m gonna and unclear you know counted the inches
0	yeah
0	unclear
0	yeah pause dur short this is the original one
0	well unclear road
0	hm
0	unclear down we can experiment and try following this down as far as the a m
0	yeah yeah pause dur short could do pause dur short might be different pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	as in we wouldn t be
0	funshack
0	vocal desc laugh it s the most fun you can have in a shack pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	it s fun for a shack pause dur short i ve got no idea what funshack is pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	sure pause dur short unclear
0	don t wanna see sunderland that brightly lit up
0	unclear i like driving pause dur short i just like being trunc ou trunc i just like being out and getting about
0	mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short i mean
0	whereas my gap year just felt like a prison sentence pause dur short so
0	unclear
0	what were you saying
0	um pause dur short i mean i guess at least with your job you re kind of in one place pause dur short and you re unclear work and you don t see the day and stuff pause dur short but then sometimes you get sent off to nice places
0	it
0	yeah
0	so that kind of just leaves three
0	okay pause dur short so
0	vocal desc laugh so actually pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	really it is three
0	yay
0	i m refreshingly surprised that this is a forty pause dur short they could very easily have just made it a thirty
0	the this
0	this road is a pain for bus lanes pause dur short unclear
0	oh yeah pause dur short it s not a problem pause dur short it s just this road in particular is quite well known for it pause dur short wow pause dur short vocal desc laugh a shop there make that bet pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	i love how anon nametype m type name did kind of admit that
0	yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh well fair enough pause dur short why give it a stupid name i guess pause dur short they could ve given it some er weird latin long name pause dur short but actually unclear let s be straightforward about it pause dur short i always think red was a really bad sign for them to choose
0	what
0	okay
0	why
0	they re quite cool
0	unclear
0	okay pause dur short um
0	do you trunc nee trunc do you need to pull over
0	er yes but i can t really
0	i told you my eyes are really tired
0	vocal desc laugh
0	shit pause dur short roundabout pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	i hope it s got toilets on it
0	uh
0	yeah yeah
0	seen the lights
0	happy valley
0	yeah pause dur short it s a very a happy valley in
0	trunc t trunc vocal desc laugh for china
0	it s alright actually pause dur short vocal desc laugh it s not that bad pause dur short ah the parks
0	yeah
1	er information sheet and you have to sign off a pause dur short the permission form so
1	oh
1	which is only right they should have that record for them
1	yeah so so other than this mixture of ecclesiastical and erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	naked profit making amongst property developers er what other kind of weekend did you have
1	vocal desc laugh er very quiet actually
1	uhu
1	i was looking forward to seeing a bit of football on the telly cos we re trunc co trunc coming to that part of the season where you
1	yes
1	it s the last gasp of things and so on but i missed
1	mm
1	the barcelona atletico match
1	oh i i saw gerard s farewell
1	ah what was that like
1	terribly disappointing
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know pause dur short the romantic in me a wanted him to win
1	yes right
1	b to score the winning goal
1	right exactly
1	and it only turned terribly tearjerking and romantic at the end when he was out with his three daughters
1	i was about to say
1	on the pitch
1	was the family brought onto the pitch i that s
1	his wife stayed in the stands
1	oh very sensible
1	trunc ye trunc but but his
1	very sensible that s right
1	young daughter and his two older ones were were with him all dressed
1	if
1	in identical outfits
1	er it s it s become a bit of a trunc tra trunc trunc traditi trunc a bit of a
1	some of the other liverpool players had their youngsters
1	yeah well
1	with them as well yes you re right it is a bit of a tradition that er that snooker player started it i think donkey s years ago when he won the world championship higgins suddenly a tearful higgins
1	yes
1	was
1	brought on with a trunc chil trunc brought on a child
1	his his child was thrust into his arms you know
1	vocal desc laugh it s
1	and that kind of thing and and this was in the crucible vocal desc laugh on a sort of a
1	unclear vocal desc laugh
1	bank holiday monday
1	that s trunc ri trunc vocal desc laugh
1	midnight or something like that vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know smoke and beery things and
1	that s right in those days when you could smoke in the stadium
1	vocal desc laugh yeah exactly
1	good heavens above
1	yeah unclear stunted unclear childhood
1	yeah
1	mm
1	is he was he the er the more er er devil er you know what do they what do we call it the kind of er buccaneering bloke er
1	yeah he was a heavy drinker
1	a heavy drinker that s right yes
1	yeah he s he died of it didn t he yeah
1	oh he died of it
1	i think so yeah i think he s dead now
1	i m thinking of some hurricane higgins i m thinking about pause dur short is it the same guy
1	yes that s the guy yeah and it s it s the same one i think
1	i thought it was pause dur short well who s currently still playing at a very advanced trunc sta trunc well quite advanced
1	mm
1	whose got that sort of reputation of being a daredevil or a
1	vocal desc sigh vocal desc misc oh i don t know i don t know enough about snooker sorry pause dur short erm i haven t really watched it in years
1	no no that s alright
1	all i remember is for those of you watching in black and white
1	right vocal desc laugh yes the well that that s right
1	the pink s behind the green or whatever or it was you know and
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh i think that s one of the great lines in commentary
1	that yes isn t it that s right exactly that s right it used to be very popular on tv didn t it it was bbc two s
1	you had pot black as well didn t you
1	trunc no trunc pot black that s the
1	yeah colour television made it
1	that s it that s it
1	you know
1	that s right that s right
1	erm but er
1	mind you it was the days when there were only three or four channels to watch so
1	indeed
1	it wouldn t have been that difficult to generate a very large audience
1	no but anyway i didn t see that erm i did some gardening
1	good
1	well nothing good about it it was a case of go out there now or get lost in the jungle and
1	that s right
1	and having to send out a search party
1	vocal desc laugh
1	to find me
1	i think saturday was
1	erm
1	good enough for that but sunday wouldn t have been i don t think would it
1	er i was lucky erm
1	okay
1	i the grass was dry enough on sunday and i i went out and er and did it and the rest of the time i was marking dissertations and
1	ah yes you
1	in chinese
1	you ve taken a whole bunch for
1	mm
1	of
1	yes
1	what were they like in the end
1	oh it s the language difficulties with the
1	sure
1	chinese students i mean
1	sure sure sure sure
1	speaking to one or two of them it becomes clearer after a bit what they re at
1	yes
1	but obviously they need to make their written english clearer too so
1	sure
1	i think there will be a bit of a challenge there but i think we ll be alright
1	i ve always
1	the dissertations
1	been struck trunc th trunc
1	one was poor one was good
1	but just in the ordinary sort of the way that of er of poorness and goodness like
1	yeah
1	everybody else
1	i mean
1	can be poor and good yeah
1	yeah erm trunc ju trunc just er just normal third year undergraduate stuff you know
1	fine
1	you know one was a third and one was a a unclear upper unclear and very clearly
1	trunc b trunc but surely these are we re talking about mscs aren t we
1	yes well i had two things here i had proposals from three four msc students
1	right
1	it was postgraduates and i
1	yes
1	also had two undergraduate dissertations which were late handed in
1	okay right
1	and the deadlines and the deadlines for the dissertations as such and the proposals that with the students here on and it really had to be done on the weekend so
1	well they re going to be sent off for the external any time soon aren t they very very imminently i think
1	yes and anon nametype n type name deals with that yeah
1	not that they must well we ve had this discussion before not that they can do much about it pause dur short that they will do much about they can t do much about it
1	no no i mean i i i think the unclear role unclear would be well i think you re consistently over marking
1	trunc e trunc exactly
1	or under marking or
1	trunc exactl trunc
1	trunc m trunc
1	trunc exac trunc
1	trunc m trunc more constructively erm er we had this a few years ago was somebody said you know you ve got some bright students why don t you encourage them
1	mm
1	to do more empirical work rather than be play safe with the with their graphical pause dur short erm
1	it s not i ve seen i ve seen in
1	and in fact that s what we ve done now
1	it s interesting
1	we we ve not we ve not put it in pause dur short a regulation it must be empirical
1	yes yes right
1	but we really
1	you allow
1	have encouraged and i would say perhaps say to you ninety percent of all of our undergraduates now do
1	interesting
1	some form of empirical work
1	interesting
1	and it s actually made much more interesting for me
1	i d have thought so
1	erm
1	i think really the empirical piece is bound to be at least a bit original
1	yeah
1	whereas a rehashing er well rehashing a long essay s just a long essay basically
1	one of our students did something i thought was really rather clever it and i m not even sure i m using this correctly it might have been even phenomenological
1	wow
1	because she did a study of her fellow students on the third year of the criminology course
1	yes
1	to see whether the pause dur short information on crime and justice had altered their pause dur short er opinions on er punishment and rehabilitation and things like that
1	but did she do it before and after
1	er i think she compared it with people who were non criminology students pause dur short you couldn t do a before and after
1	trunc ye trunc trunc ye trunc yeah
1	because you know
1	ah mm
1	yeah i know what you mean but we it it s not perfect
1	trunc ye trunc oh
1	empiricism but
1	you re right
1	you know
1	all that
1	you know
1	all that unclear said trunc wa trunc you know criminology trunc b trunc students mm
1	yeah
1	think differently or say differently from
1	yeah okay
1	non criminology students whether they d change when they were
1	there may be there may be more to it than that
1	alright okay yeah
1	because i i wasn t supervising
1	yeah yeah alright
1	this at all
1	okay that s alright
1	but erm but i yeah i thought that was er quite
1	good for her
1	a more interesting use of students
1	yes yes yes
1	rather than the the stuff on drugs
1	yeah
1	or drink or er
1	which there s more normal
1	mm
1	but do they get any research methods training from you
1	er yeah they do it i think jointly with the sociology people
1	okay right okay
1	i think it s now jointly one
1	so not thrown into the deep end
1	no no no
1	vocal desc laugh
1	no and and to be fair pause dur short very few of them for instance do anything with requiring spss
1	okay
1	it s it s i wouldn t say it s advanced it it tends to be things like online questionnaires
1	right
1	or semi structured interviews or maybe a focus group
1	fine
1	and a limited number of people
1	sure
1	you know it it would be churlish of us to say well we re it s brilliant but we re not gonna give you any marks because it s it there s there s the sample s too small you know
1	i mean with a with an online questionnaire you can reasonably easily knock up a hundred people
1	yes but it s it s difficult for instance if you wanted to interview some police officers just
1	oh no no
1	just to get
1	if you re doing
1	seven or eight
1	no no no
1	is doing brilliantly
1	that s fantastic
1	you know yeah
1	no that s a difficult kettle of fish
1	yeah yeah
1	but
1	no you re right with online stuff
1	people s perceptions of
1	yeah
1	drugs er
1	yeah
1	drugs drink whatever
1	yeah
1	that yeah that s comparatively
1	yeah
1	straightforward
1	yeah
1	it s what they do with it afterwards they re after whether they can
1	yeah indeed
1	write about it in an insightful
1	yeah
1	way and relate it to the
1	yeah
1	literature and to make theoretical
1	exactly
1	you know
1	exactly and some of them
1	unclear
1	do that really well and others you know they struggle with it
1	sure
1	but erm but it it s made for a more interesting crop
1	good
1	i think of
1	good
1	topics and
1	good good
1	erm er and to an extent i think it s the allowed them to put into practice skills that would trunc otherwi trunc or to try and develop skills that would otherwise have remained completely dormant
1	and it s another line for their cv in that regard
1	yeah
1	you know they re going to go to places which are gonna expect the student to be able to do a trunc re trunc a report on something
1	yes
1	you know
1	yeah yeah
1	be it be the performance of the shop in the last six months or
1	mm
1	you know undertake to do a survey of their customers or
1	and and for the first time they really understand firsthand you know what data is how you ve got to organise it
1	true
1	and make sense of it and
1	true
1	never mind
1	true
1	the gathering of it
1	that s right
1	you know erm
1	the kind of
1	so it s very good for them
1	unless they are going to be reading frontline research papers they may never come across data
1	mm
1	in its comparatively not raw but you know
1	yeah
1	doing in somebody doing something with it as opposed to textbooks and simply trunc re trunc reading
1	mm i think that s
1	and digesting it
1	i think that s right i mean er i can think of a couple of professions that some of our students have gone into say policing probation prison service pause dur short and i would really really struggle to think of erm pause dur short day to day jobs that they
1	mm
1	do that would
1	mm
1	require detailed erm quantitative or qualitative methods
1	no but they re gonna be in an information environment where things will come at them
1	yeah
1	and they have to understand
1	and oh i agree with all that i trunc wa trunc i mean i i i mean i think in some ways the the cleverer ones amongst them will realise that they are offering something that the probation service prison service and police don t often have and that is an ability
1	no that s true
1	to handle
1	that s true
1	quantitative
1	that s true
1	and qualitative data
1	that s true
1	because the police don t
1	that s true
1	the trunc nor trunc police would normally outsource it or
1	exactly so that s right
1	or they ve got civilian employees
1	that s right
1	to do
1	that s true
1	that kind of thing or they want academics to do the research and give them er the findings you know
1	like your good self
1	like my good self but you ve got to sign the official secrets act
1	vocal desc laugh
1	in case we don t like the outcome
1	trunc s trunc so you you may or may not have done one of those
1	i i m afraid i couldn t say
1	i trunc di trunc er could say
1	i m afraid vocal desc laugh
1	trunc i trunc it s
1	it s more than my life s worth
1	yes i i mean some of those
1	just if if you
1	er er trunc ju trunc vocal desc laugh
1	just by asking me
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know
1	i have compromised my integrity
1	trunc yo trunc there is a section er
1	yes
1	of guilt by association
1	iation that s right
1	i trunc thi trunc it s section forty two thousand five hundred and fifty eight
1	vocal desc laugh
1	of the official secrets act
1	vocal desc laugh along with all the other sections which you can t talk about either yes
1	people well who says there are sections vocal desc laugh
1	oh yeah vocal desc laugh er what what act vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh so yes there we are yeah erm
1	i wonder how many of our students go into and not just from your course but from all out courses go into the police one of my students wants to already
1	yeah
1	she s told me
1	yeah well
1	she s in her second year and she wants to she s already unclear
1	yeah well recruitment is picking up slightly erm even though they re still losing frontline officers but pause dur short you know the
1	what what does the graduate go in as a beat officer like a bobby on the beat
1	you ll you ll have to at the moment still for the time being you have to join as a pc
1	but isn t there some acceleration
1	trunc ye trunc yes
1	unclear thereafter unclear
1	but at the moment even under the sort of erm elite system of
1	yeah
1	trunc a trunc accelerated promotion you still have to join as a pc
1	but you are expected to do it for less time
1	you are expected to get to inspector after four five years or something like that
1	is that the next step up
1	no sergeant s the next
1	oh sergeant
1	step up
1	mm there s the
1	you ve got to pass the exams
1	sure
1	and pass the interviews
1	sure
1	but the idea is that they ve er they ve identified a
1	sure
1	you know your your rising star
1	yes
1	there is a it probably under the tories it might resurface but there was a little while ago a suggestion that in order to change the culture of the police
1	mm
1	and to give them skills that possibly they don t have in sufficient number at the moment pause dur short people should be allowed to join the police service much higher up the rank pause dur short so this is the argument about well wouldn t erm er wouldn t er someone who s er led a battalion and has left the
1	oh
1	army at the age of
1	yes
1	say forty
1	right yes yes
1	er trunc w trunc wouldn t
1	yes
1	he or she make a
1	yes
1	wonderful
1	yes
1	superintendent
1	yes
1	erm and someone who s been in charge of a medium sized company
1	yes
1	wouldn t they make et cetera et cetera you know
1	of course the gut answer is no but presumably
1	trunc w trunc trunc a trunc and the lower ranks wouldn t like it
1	trunc w trunc well they wouldn t like it
1	trunc th trunc that i ll tell you the more controversial
1	mm
1	suggestion
1	mm
1	and i don t see this coming about but it s been
1	mm
1	floated within the metropolitan police authority pause dur short if you really want to recruit more people from ethnic minorities
1	yes
1	let them skip the rank of pause dur short pc and sergeant now that of course is
1	mm
1	that would be seen as positive discrimination
1	yeah
1	just
1	yes yes yes yes
1	in the way that the other one isn t
1	isn t yes that s interesting
1	you know erm and and i think that would be even less popular
1	mm
1	amongst the er existing police personnel
1	vocal desc misc
1	there we are
1	it s it s such a well embedded culture
1	it is yeah
1	that you rise through the ranks
1	every chief constable in the land at the moment
1	has always been
1	has been a pc
1	mm is that true and er i think it must be true of the armed services that you can t join as a cook or major er well
1	no that that s not true
1	of course it s the officer class
1	you you can
1	yes that s
1	go in as an officer
1	okay that s
1	never having been a private
1	true
1	a sergeant
1	that s true
1	or anything
1	that s true
1	like that yeah
1	that s true that s true
1	there is a unclear spread unclear in the army
1	and in fact it s very unlikely that if you re a private you rise to the officer class
1	i think that is unusual yes it s not unheard of but it s unusual pause dur short yes
1	so if that can happen
1	well it it s happened it s happened in in the navy and the army for a long time we i mean at one time if you remember in the navy people used to buy their commissions
1	that s right that s right
1	i i don t know whether they ever did in the army but erm
1	trunc i trunc is the argument that the kinds of skills that the pause dur short privates and sergeants have aren t necessary for the colonels and majors and captains or what have you
1	i i don t know the answer to that erm
1	whereas in the police
1	it was always argued
1	those skills
1	that you had to have that on the ground experience to get a nose for what was
1	yes
1	going on
1	exactly so that s right
1	er that it i mean trunc th trunc trunc th trunc trunc th trunc there s there s a great amount of emphasis within the police culture put on practical
1	right sure
1	experiential
1	sure
1	common sense kinds of approaches to to issues
1	knowledge of the unclear and so on and so forth
1	yes yeah that kind of thing
1	that s right
1	yeah
1	whereas the private in the trunc arm trunc army is not doing anything comparable he she is is following orders in
1	yeah
1	a very large
1	yeah
1	degree they re not being sent out in teams let alone individually pause dur short they are working in a very rigid framework so
1	yes
1	it s it trunc yo trunc trunc yo trunc there s an argument there that they re not actually learning anything which would help an officer
1	yeah that s probably be
1	unless it s a trade er
1	yeah
1	unless it s
1	i think that s true and the other thing is that although the police are also er er er a sort of a ranked organisation
1	mm mm
1	and they ve set great store by it erm what s different is that a pc always exercises discretion
1	right
1	you can t
1	right right
1	order a pc to do something
1	sure sure
1	unclear wrong unclear so to speak there s always
1	well sure
1	the element of discretion
1	whereas of course in the army that s completely out of
1	in the army
1	the picture
1	you always take orders from your whether it s from your colonel or whether it s
1	yes yes
1	from your sergeant
1	that s right
1	there is very little area for discretion
1	that s right
1	and people in battle who show discretion either get killed or they win the vc you know
1	mm yeah well that s right that s right
1	it s that kind of thing isn t it you know erm
1	yes and the entry qualifications i would have trunc s trunc guessed for a even an ordinary pc are higher than that for a private in the army i m pretty sure that must be
1	they yes i mean trunc yo trunc you you can
1	that must be the case
1	go into the army with virtually no
1	with no qualifications
1	qualifications trunc b trunc as you need
1	whereas
1	trunc f trunc er gcses of a certain number i don t know what they are i think i it used to be six o levels i don t know what it is now but it s er it s not huge
1	if it s comparable then that s different from the army i would have trunc sai trunc
1	it is different you i you don t i think the army you know you really need erm good character and that kind of thing but erm even that s
1	mm
1	i mean trunc i trunc trunc i trunc there there are certain crimes
1	mm
1	you could
1	mm
1	have committed
1	mm mm
1	and they ll still have you in the army
1	what about tattoos er the army takes people with tattoos
1	yes
1	but
1	it does yeah
1	what about
1	and so does so does the
1	police officers
1	yes but trunc yo trunc they don t they wouldn t like it and you probably would get turned down if the tattoos were round your neck or something like that you know
1	fuck the police on your unclear
1	yes that kind of thing it wouldn t
1	vocal desc laugh on your forehead vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh it wouldn t it wouldn t go down
1	oh that was a a mere bagatelle when i was a youngster
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i didn t know quite i was doing

0	i can t swim
0	really you can trunc f trunc
0	i was gonna buy a barge pause dur short and he said well buy one in holland because they re much cheaper pause dur short and i said yeah but the problem is it s in holland pause dur short and he said his friends bought one and sailed it back across the channel pause dur short it s only like sixty miles
0	he runs excursions pause dur short he used to be in the army
0	vocal desc laugh
0	well he s got er he s got a boat himself that he takes them out on
0	which i think is what a lot of the er
0	er
0	right
0	can you really sail a barge across the english channel
0	p and o
0	well if you think like as we know my geography s really good
0	oh pause dur short vocal desc laugh here we go
0	if you think that this is the bottom of the uk
0	so that s dover
0	uh huh
0	here s europe
0	uh huh
0	and then holland is like here isn t it
0	yeah
0	success pause dur short so it s actually only a case of that to that
0	kind of open sea
0	yeah pause dur short it does need more research
0	you have to sail it into the rivers
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i think it might pause dur short but if there isn t one
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i think you ve just trunc re trunc
0	uh huh
0	right
0	you can just take it with you
0	vocal desc laugh
0	probably not trunc t trunc internationally pause dur short not across the er
0	yeah pause dur short across the atlantic pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	atlantic
0	don t know
0	it s not like the pacific pause dur short i mean that s doable pause dur short i mean er it might take six hours to fly across it but pause dur short yeah actually if it takes six hours to fly across it pause dur short it s probably quite far
0	somali pirates
0	yeah
0	that d be quite nice
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh see you in a couple of days
0	vocal desc laugh i m pretty confident
0	tut pause dur short it s good to have a plan
0	tut pause dur short well er we would go together and he would do the sailing and i would do the directing
0	now anon nametype f type name don t take this personally
0	hey
0	direct the project
0	not actually navigate
0	turns left unclear yeah
0	on the norfolk broads
0	uh huh
0	involving twenty thousand pounds pause dur short holland pause dur short vocal desc laugh trunc s trunc
0	cos if it is it s trunc l trunc trunc l trunc
0	vocal desc laugh
0	even by your standards
0	um pause dur short no pause dur short cos i really wouldn t have to go to that far
0	er the reason i invited him was because i know that he can sail pause dur short and he s the only person i know that can
0	i see
0	oh
0	but if that all falls in
0	if that all falls apart um i dunno what i m gonna do with the money pause dur short well it s just nice to have paid off my overdraft pause dur short like i m back in it
0	overdraft gone pause dur short i ll keep it just for emergencies but generally won t be using it
0	yeah
0	so
0	april recordings i ll put in my savings account for new york
0	oh your trunc holi trunc your tut for your birthday

0	we d have a party pause dur short um i d get her to come here and we d have a party
0	well you d go out for some drinks at some point er with the people that you know in cambridge pause dur short er i mean me actually
0	vocal desc laugh
0	i m not sure i can
0	because her birthday s november so we were thinking
0	yeah
0	and it s like um it s a bit like imagine if like a sort of smallish theatre but with all the seats stripped out
0	mm
0	oh okay
0	um and they have like bands on all the
0	but it s just good pause dur short like i really enjoyed it because it was good to just see like all the sort of cool kids pause dur short you know
0	tut pause dur short sounds awesome pause dur short that s er that s
0	yeah pause dur short it s really hard
0	she really likes it pause dur short they moved her out
0	yeah
0	and now she s back pause dur short and anon nametype f type name trunc s trunc anon nametype f type name from manufacturing she s out there
0	right
0	mm
0	uh huh
0	oh my god
0	horrendous pause dur short yeah
0	cos when my friend
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	and that s er it s just such a bitch pause dur short cos when you book the flights they say right you ll have a stop over in dubai pause dur short but because it s for three hours they tell you pause dur short but they don t tell you that they you re gonna stop in australia
0	a you look like you re flying into the water so that s pretty terrifying
0	yeah
0	and it did this three times on the descent pause dur short and er everyone was like huh uh huh pause dur short like really on edge pause dur short and he obviously thought no i m not gonna attempt this pause dur short so um
0	yeah
0	everyone s crying at this stage
0	and then tried again and the same thing happened
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short but then you get to go to er amazing places i suppose
0	would you like save up and do things like buy yourself something from tiffany s and you know
0	i know pause dur short that s the thing pause dur short cos er the hotels trunc s trunc are really expensive pause dur short and i know i went to uni with a girl who lives there and i
0	can you not stay in a hostel or something i mean unless er
0	it s your birthday though so
0	er single room it d be okay
0	so i ll have to start looking soon
0	but i think actually it s funny because the flights i mean it s the same sort of time of year that i went last year pause dur short the year before actually
0	and like if you go over a weekend it s a lot cheaper
0	than if you go
0	you said pause dur short yeah
0	yeah pause dur short for work pause dur short yeah
0	but it s so good
0	a bit of
0	unclear
0	i know pause dur short yeah pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	who get to go for good reason pause dur short you know pause dur short they re usually instigating policies or whatever
0	yeah
0	yeah i know
0	oh no none of this
0	well they say that
0	getting like travel

0	yeah me too
0	cos er my days are pretty full like my whole week pause dur short is pretty full my timetable like i go from one lecture to another blah blah erm and but the in some of them i ll have gaps so in them gaps i have i m just gonna go to the library
0	mm

0	whereas second semester was really good because i got two days off but the three days that was in were were like practically full
0	from nine o clock in the morning till five o clock at night
0	er pause dur short twenty something quid
0	burn marks on chairs like even though i wasn t in that flat and it s not my fault it s you know i m not gonna
0	no once i get my next bit of rent sorted i m gonna sort my finances out once you leave with my dad and stuff
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	i m gonna have a look at how much money i have i might just pay him in like little instalments

0	mm
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	no no the trunc eng trunc er french one
0	so i just wanna make sure that because i m not living in france and stuff they might have just sent me the email straight away of confirmation and i m not gonna get any other emails cos i m not living in france
0	yeah
0	i m hoping that s the case because if if they unclear me out of that money again pause dur short cos last year i lost out on a few thousand pause dur short i won t be able to survive the year if i don t get the french money though that s for damn sure pause dur long i mean i have a little bit saved up but pause dur short that four hundred or whatever is not gonna last long
0	mm pause dur short like or anon type place uni
0	yeah i m gonna have a look at any kind of help that i can get though because
0	yeah i ll do all of that with my dad i ll take a day out to do that
0	mm
0	it s just the stress of if that doesn t happen cos i know that my dad will always be there to help me but he s not in a position where he physically can
0	mm
0	yeah
0	and i ll live off that pause dur long
0	it s just under eight grand pause dur short half of that ll pay your rent
0	so
0	yeah yeah
0	yeah
0	living
0	bus pass
0	yeah you don t want to yeah
0	cos you know i might need it in the third year i might need it towards getting a placement or something
0	yeah rather than a voluntary work yeah
0	and you do get paid for it
0	it ll all be alright
0	yeah
0	i don t wanna do it in england
0	i want to put it well i want to take advantage sort of being able to go abroad without having to worry about every single part of financing
1	i mean how many settees do you throw out per year
1	yes exactly
1	but they won t pick up fixtures like baths showers pause dur short be as i had that issue with them before and they said sorry we just don t do it so you either have to put it in the back of your car or store it out somewhere or hire a skip so i ve had my bathroom done now and my downstairs loo
1	ah now i meant to ask you about that because i ve i ve given up the notion of having it done in this expensive way did i tell you how much it was going to cost me eight thousand pounds
1	you said it was over eight thousand pounds i ve had both of mine done for just under four thousand pounds
1	are you happy with them
1	well you can come and see it if ever you want to upstairs
1	i ll take you up on that if i may
1	you may come up and look the only thing i haven t done is decorate it i mean he s tiled the floor he s put in new erm you know not
1	the pedestal and the wc
1	yeah pause dur short yeah and a bath and he s re plumbed my electric shower as in he s hidden
1	bloody hell
1	all the accoutrements he even put in a new light for me which i bought
1	yeah yeah
1	from the electrics he s re tiled everything that was tiled
1	yes
1	er he s ripped up the old floor he s put in a new floor
1	bloody hell
1	and he s done downstairs as well erm
1	and all for less or about four thousand pounds
1	roughly four trunc thou trunc
1	both of those together
1	roughly four thousand pounds
1	did you have to buy the materials
1	that s including
1	that s including materials unclear
1	the trunc mater trunc the materials were about er they you know the bath the two toilets the two wash basins
1	mm pause dur short mm
1	the tiles and so on that was about nine hundred and ninety pounds or something which i gave him months ago so that he could go buy them
1	yeah he could just go and buy them
1	he even fitted pause dur short a new door between down the side of my house because we had another wooden gate had fallen to pieces pause dur short erm er erm pause dur short and that was included in the price and the door itself was a hundred and seventy pounds with hinges
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	the last thing he did was pause dur short downstairs i ve got one of those light pulls
1	yes
1	you know on a little piece of cord
1	yes yes
1	and i happened to notice that it was wearing through
1	right
1	because they always
1	frayed they fray that s right
1	they get frayed he said oh all we got to do he said is take the unscrew it
1	yes
1	and then you can re wire it
1	that s right exactly
1	re tie it well he took it off himself he said you can t they they it s a switch you have got to buy a whole new thing
1	oh right
1	last day he turned up for work which was with my was monday pause dur short he came in and he said i got you a new one and he said oh i said what do you need he said oh don t worry about it i ll fit it for you and he fitted it for me and did it and he even put the the gungy stuff round the outside to make sure it was all nice and neat
1	yes yes yeah pause dur short well that s a cooperative bloke pause dur short and reliable and the rest of it
1	whether he whether he works up in anon type place or not but he ll give you free estimates and all the rest of it
1	it might just be worth his while for that kind of money cos otherwise it s you know two hour not kind of two hours
1	well he lives in anon type place
1	well that is two hours then
1	yeah yeah i suppose so
1	well about an hour and unclear
1	i don t know how far afield he works and he works more than i mean i it took me something like five months to get him because he was booked up
1	ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	well so much so that i m gonna have him back in about year s time to do my kitchen
1	book him now and then you have him in
1	yeah he s even told me how to get it done cheaply pause dur short like going to unclear
1	well kitchens are necessarily going to be more expensive because of all the appliances all the gas and so on and so on
1	yeah exactly yeah so pause dur short but he does it all
1	good for him
1	and he s he s a carpenter basically and he does and he well he does kitchens and bathrooms pause dur short but anyway you re you re more than welcome to come around and
1	that s very good but why did he have to change your bath baths are usually pretty
1	well you see again it just annoyed me
1	okay
1	because it s it s as old as the house now i ve been there since two thousand and the house was about seven years old then so
1	mm mm was it a plastic one rather than a metal or ceramic one
1	well erm the bath was plastic
1	unclear
1	anyway but the thing was it was it was like a light blue colour and the one downstairs was like a a sort of a pale yellowy colour well i d just put white in there
1	okay pause dur short okay
1	erm and my brother bless him did the tiling upstairs in the guest bathroom
1	that s very good of him
1	but unfortunately neither he nor i knew that you can t put ceramic tiles onto a wooden floor unless you
1	ah have a a some
1	cos what happens is all all the gunge between the tiles starts to crack
1	yes pause dur short yeah yes yes yes yes
1	it looked okay but you know to my eye
1	yeah yeah pause dur short true
1	but to anyone else it s like unclear to my eyes though unclear
1	mm but it s just not flat enough if it s a wooden floor
1	no that s right so erm
1	mm
1	i was very pleased with what he s done
1	mm
1	erm yeah
1	well i mean tradespeople like that you grab onto them because you otherwise it s unclear you don t know
1	well as i said he he worked for next door
1	yeah
1	and he worked with my neighbours next door in their original house and when they moved into this one they trunc wan trunc they had him back
1	yeah
1	and they showed me what he d done and i just thought well i m not gonna go running around now getting
1	exactly yes pause dur short that s unclear
1	so i i grabbed hold of him sometime in may or june and we agreed that we would do it in late september early october pause dur short but
1	i imagine he uses less upmarket materials because it can get very expensive furnishing bathrooms
1	oh i could of spent four thousand pounds on the bath
1	yes yes unclear
1	and the taps and goodness knows whatever else in fact i didn t choose them i just said anon nametype m type name just go and get me something functional and basic
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	but he s got me mixer taps everywhere
1	yeah
1	and i ve got cut off valves whereas before
1	mm mm
1	i d have to turn one off from the main thing but now i ve got cut off valves on everything toilet bath because they weren t there you see as standard unclear
1	is your bath as it was unclear low so you can see and get underneath it
1	no it s got a it s got a slide it s got a
1	you can take it off easy
1	you can take that off easily it s just a couple of screws
1	right well that s already an improvement on vocal desc laugh on mine where i started to see a leak or not a leak i started to see water damage
1	yeah
1	at the base of the outside wall on the bathroom and i thought what the hell s going on i just couldn t figure it out in my mind at all cos it was nowhere near the the shower end it was the
1	mm
1	if you like the the head end of the bath on the outside you know the corridor wall inside my inside the flat and i got it into my head that it was leaking from the bottom of the bath
1	right
1	don t know how it could possibly do that there and i thought well i ll just take off the side panel of the bath
1	yeah
1	but the side panel was a mirror or is a mirror
1	oh right
1	and behind the mirror there was a pause dur short thin wooden sheet which was put on some extremely tight fitting unclear way unclear so i had to smash in some er some end of it and to pull it all out i looked underneath the bath and it was completely dry
1	that is strange
1	very strange just unclear
1	so you didn t find out why this
1	no i called a plumber in and he scratched his head and he said well in fact it s nothing to do with the under side of the bath the problem is in the taps the head of the bath
1	mm
1	and the water is somehow finding its way all along the rim of the bath and going down and staining the bottom of the unclear so
1	oh right
1	he had to put the er yeah he fixed it easily enough he just changed the pause dur short the er taps and the heads of the taps
1	yeah right
1	and then put the erm the wooden bit back on i i asked him kindly if he would put the mirror back on and he demurred and he said well we don t really touch mirrors and i said well look you know
1	mm
1	give me a hand and we ll be alright so he very kindly did put it
1	right okay
1	against the er the side of the bath
1	yeah
1	but then it was left to me to
1	to to screw that on
1	to then screw it on but screwing glass
1	mm that can shatter
1	yeah
1	well er with anon nametype m type name erm when he came he said to me he says my brother and his mate put the electric shower in and they ran the cold water off the electric shower by a series of pipes coming off the cold water feed but it looked neat but they they re exposed
1	yeah yeah
1	so it is like the pompidou centre or unclear
1	vocal desc laugh right
1	and erm anon nametype m type name just said er see i i if you wanted me to put in an electric shower i would bring in an electrician to check it
1	mm
1	but since it s in there i can do all of this do you want me to hide it all and so it s got dug into the wall and then he put the tiles
1	much better
1	over it
1	much better
1	it isn t a problem he he he does
1	sure
1	all the electrics and all the rest of it erm and then at one point i said to him oh that lamp you know it s one of those awful sort of lamps and unclear think oh unclear with something more modern and he said go go to b and q you know i will put it in for you you know
1	yeah
1	erm i could of done it myself but erm you know why bother when you have got someone who really knows his stuff
1	no no absolutely not
1	so he s changed two lights for me he has done electrical work pause dur short the gate he bought for the thing erm pause dur short it is a bit of a squeeze you know
1	mm
1	whereas he gets his plane out and
1	yes yes yes yes yes
1	unclear makes this unclear wonderful thing you know and he s just a little bit more just a little bit more
1	that s right that s right
1	and he even told me about the best way to put the preservative on it he said half and half he said turpentine
1	mm
1	and you know unclear prop unclear things and let it soak into it cos you see so many gates pause dur short covered in this beautiful brown thing and it starts to peel you know
1	right pause dur short yes pause dur short yes yes pause dur short right nothing behind it
1	unclear hasn t been able to sink in whatever well if you think
1	right right right okay
1	bloody hell i didn t know about that you know
1	i know i know
1	so that s what i did over the weekend you know a sort of a a wash and then unclear
1	yes pause dur short it s the kind of thing which lay people could do vocal desc laugh
1	yes exactly yeah yeah
1	they get the brush out and dab some stuff all over a piece of wood we can do that we can t plane
1	yeah that s right yeah we could do that
1	at least i could not plane
1	well i don t know i don t even have a plane so
1	probably unclear haven t got one unclear exactly and planing is probably much more subtle and difficult than it might be
1	yeah exactly so erm and he was saying the tiles you know suddenly he said anon nametype m type name can you come up and he said do you know it looks like it s ninety degree angles but it s not
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	so you know i think it is better if we start here and when you come in the eye will see everything geometric and we can hide the trunc lit trunc the fact that
1	square yeah pause dur short yes yes yes
1	it won t be going like that it ll be going like this down there yeah that s fine you know
1	yeah right again people like us will just start from the bottom
1	yeah that s right
1	vocal desc laugh unclear work upwards and discover that it s completely skew whiff at the top
1	and the other thing too of course is he completely tiles the whole floor and then the stand for the wash basin and the actual toilet itself
1	mm
1	sits on it he does not have to cut around it you see
1	oh right
1	it sits on the tiles and then you get that clear view sealant all the way round the bottom of it
1	right because of course the pipes don t go through the tiles the pipes go through the wall pause dur short okay
1	yeah at the back yeah
1	okay yeah yeah yeah
1	they re at the back so i mean the the where the affront goes out he has had to cut round that
1	yes that is right
1	but that s largely hidden by the toilet anyway
1	that s good
1	mm
1	you could also apparently get these days get very thin erm pause dur short what is it called the the actual tank of the toilet
1	yeah yeah er low flush or small unclear
1	exactly someone who got
1	erm i think i have certainly downstairs because he was saying that he had to baton on the wall because it would not fit on the wall cos it s different
1	mm
1	the one i had was so much
1	yeah
1	bulkier and of course you can t just stick it on the wall because it s got to fit over the toilet
1	right
1	you know so he s had to put a baton on it but that isn t a that is the problem so it stands about that far off the wall but by the time you ve painted that baton the same colour as the wall it s just got
1	you won t see it no exactly absolutely that s right
1	i mean downstairs pause dur short trunc i trunc if you if i showed you downstairs you d see well you can see bare patches where the tiling s been altered and and some little casing that had to be fractured to get things out which trunc ha trunc has not been repaired that s up to me to do that right well all i ve done is put a er you know unclear built an ornament over it
1	vocal desc laugh oh right okay
1	but you go upstairs
1	yeah and that that s more fully done right
1	you go upstairs and you might even think the upstairs has been decorated
1	mm
1	although it hasn t just at that the tiling
1	been put in mm
1	fits in more exactly with the old tiles if you see what i mean erm but as i say you you re you re welcome to come along and unclear if you want
1	very good
1	but erm
1	another er embellishment which i was offered which hadn t occurred to me i did not know that things existed was a slow drop toilet seat
1	i ve got two of those
1	vocal desc laugh you are living in the upmarket toilet world i can see
1	it is really boring though because
1	vocal desc laugh
1	they don t just go vocal desc misc
1	no
1	they just go
1	okay
1	and you think oh life s too short
1	vocal desc laugh life s too short
1	you come back five minute s later oh yeah it s down it s really that bad you know
1	erm can they be in emergencies overridden vocal desc laugh if you see what i mean
1	oh i see what i trunc me trunc yes you can i think you can actually press the unclear
1	okay right right
1	yes i take your point unclear
1	vocal desc laugh unclear very embarrassing
1	that could that could be awkward yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	unclear you can press them down that is true yep
1	yes without trunc f trunc fracturing of
1	but i mean they are not expensive i mean as i said
1	okay
1	if you think of all the sanitary wear and size and everything it was nine hundred and something nine hundred and sixty nine hundred and seventy pounds or something like that
1	well you could as i was saying you could spend thousands of pounds
1	yeah
1	in the kind of er bathrooms you see in country life you know and those sort of er
1	yeah yeah but you ve gotta have the you need the space for that too unclear in some respects unclear you know i mean it s the same with the kitchens you know i was talking about trunc d trunc do i said do you do kitchens you know and he said yeah trunc s trunc you know so what i do is i go to b and q and he said oh no don t go to b and q he said go to houghton s i said well that is
1	yes that is right
1	and he said well you ve never heard of houghton s probably he said because they don t deal with the public they only deal with people like me
1	that is right that s right that s right
1	and i said well how am i going to get it then and he said well you tell them that you re working through me and then they ll sell it to you so i thought so they sell it to me at wholesale he said yes great
1	vocal desc laugh
1	who gets to design it he said they ll come and design it for free
1	oh
1	they ll come to your house and design for free cos they know that
1	oh that s interesting pause dur short yeah they will buy sell that stuff
1	he said don t worry i unclear cos i deal with them all the time he said so i thought great he said but but if you are thinking of doing this next year get them to come over and design it to your satisfaction
1	yeah yeah
1	and get a price and show me the plans so that i can it you know it s feasible obviously and tell them you are not buying it until the sale and they have one sale a year and it s in october
1	very good very true
1	but it is like he said if you want marble worktops
1	yeah yeah sure sure sure sure
1	there s ten thousand pounds already
1	yeah sure sure sure
1	so i shall be
1	i m sure they re very nice
1	i m sure they are but i have got ones that look like marble
1	vocal desc laugh well the thing about the ones that look like marble is they don t act like marble as i learned to my cost the other day
1	no no
1	when i put down a too hot pan
1	ah
1	and of course it blistered so
1	well of course you chefs pause dur short chefs du jour who do that kind of thing erm
1	vocal desc laugh but it wasn t a flamb with the flames rising out of it
1	ah no but in my case it s bringing something out of the oven with oven gloves and you know yeah i see what you mean
1	unclear there s there s unclear
1	yeah i know what you mean about unclear that unclear
1	exactly what what er the builder who we got for my mum who is very pleased with him said look don t go to b and q or wilks or whatever they re called er wicks wicks
1	wicks yeah
1	because a they re they re not very good and b they are expensive
1	that is right
1	so he took me to this place which of course in some out of the way industrial estate somewhere
1	that is right it is the same in anon type place anon type place it is tucked away down the off off the
1	unclear it s not like b and q which has to be accessible and visible to the public
1	no no no pause dur short but you can go and visit their store and they will come out to you
1	sure pause dur short ah that s i trunc had trunc hadn t know that that s interesting
1	well they ll they ll come out and do the design apparently they ll come out and measure it because you you d be mad to measure it yourself
1	oh god yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	you know because if you re out by that much you know
1	yeah by by a an inch the whole thing imagine fitting an appliance in a space which is too small for it
1	yeah yeah pause dur short but in but in his case you see i ve said to him i want the floor to go i want all the tiling done in in the kitchen and probably while i m at it i might want a few sockets moved around to make unclear room unclear
1	sure while you re doing it do everything
1	so he is going to do it all
1	absolutely that s right
1	and apparently they also supply the erm appliances er if you want to buy them from houghton s er erm
1	there s no need because appliances can be got anywhere they re all of a standard size
1	yeah that that well that s true you can but i mean what i m saying is he will fit it unclear
1	yes sure he ll fit it that s right
1	nowadays with gas things it is just a case of uncoupling the thing and
1	yes that s right
1	erm
1	but your my memory of your kitchen wasn t it was perfectly alright
1	no it is perfectly alright but again it s
1	of the er of the era yes alright
1	and i think unclear it it s more modern i mean this kitchen s probably only about er ten or eleven years old pause dur short but you see the appliances look sad and tired and i don t want one where i ve gotta bend down to open the you know the oven anymore i want i want an oven at pause dur short at eyesight level and i want a hob that s at the same level as the work space
1	vocal desc laugh what you re describing if i may say this anon nametype m type name is what you call
1	don t be too insulting
1	these days a first world problem
1	well i mean think south wales is probably
1	vocal desc laugh
1	one and half
1	vocal desc laugh
1	we re not quite third world we we re certainly not third world
1	alright it s aspirational that s right
1	you know the the working class boy is still in there you know
1	vocal desc laugh oh yes oh i d like a hot tap vocal desc laugh
1	yes well we never used to have one actually yeah actually that s er you ve put me in my place now you you ve shamed me
1	that s right but there are such things trunc ap trunc trunc ap trunc apparently and allegedly which are boiling water taps
1	i don t think i will have one of those no i i ve got a dishwasher
1	it s meant for people who cannot be bothered to wait for the kettle to boil
1	i can wait for the kettle to boil yeah
1	you can okay that is something you ve learnt over over the years
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah i can i don t use my
1	you ve got delayed gratification unclear down pat unclear
1	i don t use my kettle that often
1	vocal desc laugh
1	except when i ve got workman in and then i have to find the sugar as well you know
1	right okay yes yes that s right vocal desc laugh
1	in a tupperware box hidden somewhere in the back of one of the one of the cupboards
1	yes that s exactly right yes non sugar households have only got cubes usually
1	yeah pause dur short yeah that s right yeah
1	and they re somewhere inaccessible you know you put them away somewhere unclear
1	then you think can sugar go off does it go off no no it does not have a shelf life unclear
1	vocal desc laugh unclear is it green no it s probably alright
1	unclear a bit yellow but it ll be fine
1	yellow is fine
1	yellow is fine well a green is dangerous
1	yeah yeah certainly
1	yes
1	okay well i shall very kindly
1	i was very pleased trunc wi trunc
1	i ll take up your very kind offer if i may at some point
1	not at all you re more than welcome more than welcome
1	good excellent
1	erm and of course i mean if you if you strip out some of his labour and some of the other costs i i i don t know if i could do that guest bathroom cost considerably less than four thousand pounds
1	i mean what do you buy as the package i m
1	yeah
1	i m exactly in your position i don t want to engage with it all other than say i d like it to look like this
1	mm
1	arrange it so let it be so
1	well i was shocked when you showed me cos you had that d view
1	yes yes
1	and i thought your place is a similar size to mine and i thought when you said it was eight thousand something or other and i was beginning to wonder well yeah even if you have it tiled from top to bottom that s not eight thousand pounds
1	no it it s it s the price of the trunc appl trunc not the appliances the furniture
1	yeah
1	er and the materials out of which they re made
1	right okay
1	er the tiles are extremely expensive they look lovely but then
1	yeah
1	that s because they are coroda marble or whatever it might be
1	well yeah yeah i know but it s like anything else i went to topps tiles you know
1	unclear
1	cos i i you know to to choose something and i was bewildered by their choice
1	the choice unclear
1	and in the end i just thought black pause dur short i just went for black with kind of an unevenness on it you know so
1	right er and you could have gone up down left right in terms of price
1	oh i could still be there now
1	yeah yeah
1	and i i thought this i m not even gonna use this you know i mean i just want something presentable for guests
1	yes right okay yeah
1	it s black and then i thought i could save myself some money it ll be black downstairs in the little toilet
1	as well vocal desc laugh that s right the same ones right
1	unclear the stairs as well yeah
1	yes are only one piece of the jigsaw you could save a bit of money
1	mm
1	or you can not save a bit of money but if you
1	yeah
1	have it all at the cheapest rate it ll look cheap on the other hand if you have all at the expensive rate it will be astronomic
1	yeah pause dur short yeah and i mean i i d say what what he s done especially in the guest bathroom upstairs it just doesn t look it just looks really pause dur short very modern very functional i put up a few african things in there you know
1	fine that s all you want
1	you know erm it s the kind of thing where if somebody said yeah you can use that wall there you wouldn t worry about it unclear
1	yes you wouldn t feel embarrassed by yes trunc exact trunc vocal desc laugh that s right yes
1	and i m thinking mm pause dur short should of cleaned behind the taps or something like that
1	yes yes that s right unclear yes
1	so yeah i m very pleased with him what he s done anyway
1	good good good that s good to know
1	i sent erm anon nametype f type name a card by the way
1	good
1	i didn t manage to get in touch with her unfortunately but i sent her a card
1	good good good good
1	i have asked unclear her unclear to sort of give me a ring
1	that that ll be very welcome i think
1	yeah yeah i i put a first class stamp on it today is tuesday isn t it so she may have got it by now
1	good
1	i trunc pu trunc i went into the post late sunday night erm
1	right
1	you know if first class stamps mean anything trunc s trunc should
1	i m seeing anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name on friday
1	oh do give them my best regards
1	unclear your regards
1	yes
1	anon nametype m type name has retired but he s still working interestingly enough
1	what s he doing
1	he s doing bits and bobs like sometimes people do when they you know stop doing the actual full time job consultancy unclear here unclear and consultancy unclear there unclear
1	yeah pause dur short right well he s got a lot of quantitative skills unclear that kind of thing yes i can imagine
1	unclear it s unclear hugely desirable
1	see that s what anon nametype m type name s been doing for the last few years you know and keeping himself busy and sometimes he gets to go abroad still
1	mm mm
1	you know still getting some reasonable income out of it as well you know cos he s got those unclear skills
1	well he s got the book
1	yeah well i know that that makes him a fortune
1	and he s i think my memory of it was when i met him in the wherever it was the bookshop he said he s got a helper on it or more than one helper
1	i think he may have actually i mean he s doing another version of it
1	yes
1	why wouldn t you
1	well wouldn t you sure
1	i mean it s earning him tens of thousands unclear at unclear a time
1	absolutely right if he gets somebody to do the legwork he s very he s assiduous about updating that
1	well no i agree but you know i was going to say differential equations but you know pause dur short he he doesn t change very much you know er
1	no no er pause dur short i think he s updating
1	i think unclear you come up with new examples possibly or
1	sure sure sure sure sure
1	or some new study showing
1	yes
1	unclear was good about it and this was a flaw in it but
1	true true true
1	but you know you know the various tests unclear square and all the rest of it they they stay the same you know i i
1	no but his if it if it s the one i m thinking of of anon nametype m type name since has got a lot more substandard stuff in it so he needs to trunc cu trunc update the research unclear or something unclear
1	yeah yeah i no i think that s one of the reasons why it sold so much
1	yes
1	it s got not just the you know the statistical techniques but
1	yes sure
1	applied in the real world you know that s what makes it such a good book i mean it seems to be on every methodologically reading list i ve ever come across you know pause dur short lucky devil
1	well talking of differential equations there was a story in the guardian yesterday
1	yeah
1	er an obituary about a trunc ma trunc a mathematician
1	mm
1	who d written the text books on calculus
1	oh
1	and you think well sell a few thousand i suppose he sold five hundred thousand a year
1	good god all round the world i take it
1	all round the world and he was a multi millionaire
1	oh my you wouldn t think so would you calculus like that you just wouldn t think so
1	if you write it both for universities and for schools two different versions and it s you know the the best one there is
1	see there was a book on a level economics that was like too but i can t think of the name of it now
1	was it lipsy
1	lipsy it was lipsy
1	ah we had lipsy too there you are
1	yep pause dur short everyone had lipsy
1	i m sure they d still unclear lipsy
1	i mean he s dead but i mean it s still lipsy unclear forth or fifth unclear edition
1	trunc absolu trunc yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	and then tiny print written like down unclear like the third or something like that you know pause dur short erm
1	erm vocal desc laugh yes that s right vocal desc laugh pause dur short the lipsy estate must be very very happy
1	yeah pause dur short is it too late for us to do something like that
1	it s never too late
1	vocal desc laugh
1	anon nametype n type name on bathrooms
1	yes yes vocal desc laugh that will really coin it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	see you later anon nametype m type name
1	thank you very much for the coffee see you later
1	cheers mate
1	well i trunc d trunc i didn t bring all of them just just a selection
1	how many have you got
1	mm well i i had something like seventy printed out and not expensive i ve got a few
1	selected from how many photos vocal desc laugh four hundred
1	oh god pause dur short well i i would say probably five hundred on two cameras yeah
1	before you show it was that the case last year that something happened to
1	yeah i yeah it started erm to leaking it started to leaking erm and i i lost a few but but my brother it turns out had taken six hundred photographs on one camera so
1	unclear shit pause dur short it s not the same as your own photographs though of your holiday but
1	no i mean
1	at least least he got some
1	no i i i still have a fair number on one camera
1	right
1	erm but but not on the other one unclear
1	right
1	so this is this is in the matobo hills which is a world heritage site largely it s a combination of the the this basalt gold granite rock i should say granite rock and the culture and the languages and all the rest of it but it s a world heritage site and in fact where we were staying is built around cases like this
1	in fact probably built off that kind of rock
1	yeah and in fact sometimes that will be the wall the side wall the back wall and these are the kinds of places we stayed in
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so this lodge
1	wow
1	this lodge or chalet is on one of those
1	oh
1	but you re sitting out point is across this bridge that s a bridge with the you know the wood and the ropes and the unclear
1	is it as wobbly as it looks
1	it is yeah
1	ah
1	if you d had a drop to drink the fall is just about enough to er
1	vocal desc laugh
1	severely injure you
1	trunc i trunc it s not impossible to fall between those
1	no
1	er struts is it
1	it it trunc i trunc the thing is if the two of you go across the first one sets up an oscillation and because my brother went across in front of me and that s what threw me but anyway that s a typical there s only eight places and this is one of them and of course a lot of them our washbasin for instance was made out of carved granite
1	oh
1	and that was quite pause dur short and this is the matobo hills national park
1	is that trunc w trunc the one where you approached very gingerly the white rhino
1	yeah yeah and this is er rhino one one four
1	oh right
1	erm apparently when we saw anon nametype m type name afterwards he identified it to the rangers and they said oh that will be one one four and so he s a bit white rhino er about fifty yards away
1	fifty yards away so you
1	about fifty yards
1	a little bit
1	yeah but erm all he did was keep twitching his ears and grunting and occasionally he d turn away but he he he wasn t too bothered he hung around for about eight minutes or so before he decided to go
1	what a beast
1	yeah and then we saw a little pride of lions they had cubs but the cubs were hidden so we couldn t see them we did briefly see the the the trunc c trunc the male lion i don t think i ve got a photograph of him there were two females and something different then and you can see in the dry season how difficult it would be to spot these because their coat is almost exactly the same
1	just go back for a moment how far away were you from from that
1	we were in a vehicle but we were only about ten yards away
1	she wasn t perturbed by that
1	well they did get out and wander off into thick bush after a while i think they got a bit miffed with us trying to manoeuvre the vehicle to get a better shot and that s what i was thinking
1	yeah
1	and er they just think oh we ve had enough of this and they wander off you know but they they not didn t run off
1	no no
1	they didn t growl or anything it was just a case of oh let s get some peace and quiet
1	vocal desc laugh
1	just happened to catch him in the er at the long at the dusting himself in the in the
1	that s a great shot
1	in the stuff you know
1	wow wow
1	this is this is the secretary bird
1	i don t think we ve seen birds much in unclear
1	no this is a secretary bird apparently named around about the early nineteen hundreds because a lot of secretaries in new york city used to dress in black stockings black erm dress and white top
1	okay
1	and this was and when when they came to work they d have a hat with feathers in it
1	ah ha ha okay
1	bird was similar
1	good enough story but okay fine
1	yeah yeah and they they caught snakes so all the locals love them
1	yeah
1	and that s the typical scene where i have a glass of white wine in my hand having finished a sunday drive
1	yes that s good
1	erm and these these are camel thorn trees here and that s the kind of sunsets you get you know it s a it s a tough old life i can assure you
1	it is a glass of wine rather than a g and t
1	oh they some people had g and ts but i i i stick to my er chilled white wine
1	was it local wine i mean how local was it
1	it s south african
1	south african i don t suppose you ve always got unclear that unclear particular unclear might have unclear
1	it may have but we didn t come across it pause dur short now these shots the next few were taken from our hide which is underground so
1	oh this one s looking up
1	this this
1	yeah that s
1	the photograph s been taken from ground level
1	that s fantastic fantastic shot
1	erm and the water is just by there and there is another water hole further down so you know that s the kind of impression
1	vocal desc laugh that s just amazing
1	and he knows
1	just amazing
1	he knows we re there but he s not bothered you know because he can t see our silhouette we re not using flash we re not making noise
1	are their eyes forward looking or are they on the side of the head
1	they are mostly forward looking yeah they have very poor eyesight but they would see you from that distance and and that s him again with the water coming out and this was another little family that came up but it s because this is where the freshest water is it comes out here and it bubbles through a little gully down to a trunc m trunc a water hole but there the water the water is all muddy and mushed up because they they do everything in it
1	right pause dur short yeah
1	but here it s absolutely trunc f trunc in fact trunc y trunc you and i could drink out of it it s come up through
1	through so much self filtering
1	seventy seventy metres of kalahari sand apparently these are the night owl unclear
1	oh aren t they sweet
1	at anon type place primary school which is in hwange national park and this is as we ve arrived they re singing and dancing for us and then they took us into the classrooms and showed us their workbooks and erm charming
1	one thing they themselves have to buy their uniforms
1	trunc n trunc i think so and their trunc p trunc for for this it s thirty dollars a term to pay so it s ninety dollars a year
1	unclear and for what
1	and that that means that there are some children who don t come to school
1	sure
1	and secondary school is a hundred dollars but but the participation rates are getting a lot better this is us on an all day game drive where we ve stopped for lunch that s that s my brother there by the way erm and this is an american couple and this is anon nametype m type name the guide and his assistant has has taken
1	taken the photograph
1	and so this is lunch erm and they will see the table with help yourself food and this is what we re looking at and we sat there for an hour and a half
1	vocal desc laugh put those together that s just a wonderful comparison isn t it
1	yeah yeah and we just had herd after herd of elephants
1	you just sat there and they paraded in front of you
1	just watched yes and in fact we walked down to this area as well and anon nametype m type name he was saying don t go any further because there s crocodiles and there s hippos
1	vocal desc laugh
1	or if the trunc l trunc if the elephants were coming around this side he said we ll now come back now but when they were on the other side we could go down a bit and in fact one of the crocodiles did surprise the group of elephants erm and and made it made it startle and move away the reason being erm that the elephants have to be careful we actually saw an elephant that was perfectly healthy but it had lost the bottom eight nine ten inches of its trunk
1	trunk
1	and it had to adapt but it it was with the herd it was well fed and all the rest of it it was fine and that was a cheetah who the hell spotted that i i don t know how the guy behind should say he spotted that it looks easy now but we were a fair distance away when he spotted it and he must have eyes attuned to
1	just remind me of the difference between a cheetah and a leopard
1	yeah the cheetah is much lighter erm built for speed erm wouldn t harm or really wouldn t even think of harming a human being in normal circumstances
1	ah uhu uhu
1	a leopard will mostly run away from you but it could harm you if it wanted to and it s
1	again when there s er when there s young
1	yeah yeah
1	at risk
1	and leopards are stealth erm hunters they get up close
1	yeah
1	these are obviously no but
1	ah yes
1	we had a sunday on our motorbikes and then these were
1	unclear these unclear look young that way
1	er trunc n trunc not they re well they re they they look quite young in the sense that they are probably twenty twenty five year old but we can t see we can t see the matriarch but trunc the trunc these are of childbearing age so to speak
1	okay okay right
1	they re quite small in in some ways but one of one of these has a little baby round here and this is us round the campfire anon nametype m type name i just want to point out the wine
1	ah vocal desc laugh
1	thing with with ice in it and er the bottles of chilled white are are in there
1	how much of your own labour went into the appropriation of any of this none presumably
1	well i did i did pick up a a piece of wood
1	and throw it
1	and throw it in the fire
1	that s very good
1	and and and i did order the wine erm and like there is my glass and i i did pick it up and drink it
1	vocal desc laugh you did you held it yourself
1	yes and i did take part in the conversations and there is the water hole from the water hole just down there so you know there was some now these are the elephants that drink out the
1	ah the one that s in the perimeter yes yes yes
1	so there is the water hole most of the elephants are down here but a few come up and i am stood on this deck on on the deck so i m not far away
1	no no you couldn t be any closer
1	and you know
1	yeah
1	tricks and some what
1	that s a great photograph
1	vocal desc laugh just a superb photograph and it s the delicacy and you know when the first one came up it put its trunk in and it went like that to knock the dust off the top of the water
1	oh
1	then it expelled the water first of all and then it drank
1	right okay
1	so it s really quite delicate now this is how close you can get to an elephant this is in a vehicle that is my brother taking a photograph of an elephant
1	uh huh that s a nice shot i like it
1	you could you could almost touch it when that elephant was putting its trunk out to smell us if you d been stupid you could have touched the trunk
1	that would have been stupid yes
1	and they re drinking from this
1	tiny
1	they made this this is where they ve there s a pipe underneath here running along this track taking water from a borehole to a a lodge somewhere and they can smell it even though it s underwater in a plastic pipe it s about a metre down they dug down punctured it and this is what they ve got and this is fresh water to drink and they just weren t bothered they weren t bothered at all that we were there look you can see all the little ones their mothers are not bothered so they re not bothered
1	yeah yeah pause dur long by did to just the familiarity with the vehicle
1	this this particular one in fact anon nametype m type name said that he had trunc ca trunc i don t know whether it was this one or this one when we when we drove up i thought how much closer is he going to get and he stopped literally inches away from the nearest elephant and he said she probably won t do it because it s not cold enough but in the winter when i stop close to her she comes up and puts her trunk on the bonnet of my car to warm it up that s how relaxed this herd is but he knows that and this is then moving away from the waterhole
1	yes yes pause dur short that gives that gives a much better sense of the the environment
1	yes it does is more this is more natural in a way than this kind of thing and the pool
1	yes yes that s right but okay
1	you know and there s a there s a grand they they they amble away they are like this when you see them going you know
1	what sort of temperature when you look at that what s it like what s it feel like to be in that environment
1	this er this this is very dry environment there is a not a lot humidity erm this is about thirty degrees erm
1	hot
1	centigrade
1	hot
1	yeah it is it is quite hot erm between twelve and three o clock it s erm it s hard work going anywhere and and this is erm victoria falls erm and you can walk you start at this end this is the start and you walk along this gorge here the drop for about a kilometre and a half and there is the classic er
1	mm yeah the classic rainbow
1	rainbow thing
1	that is spectacular there s no doubt about it that s just spectacular
1	yeah and of course this is the low flow season so you don t get the huge noise and the huge spray though there is quite a lot of spray erm but you can take photographs because trunc y trunc you re not getting drenched
1	otherwise you d yes you d be drenched
1	and this guy is very close to the lip fishing for a living
1	oh christ god vocal desc laugh
1	erm i mean that s that s brave that is and that is the thing going over the edge
1	ah that s good that s terrific
1	yeah and that side is zambia and you get the best views on this side from zimbabwe
1	oh that s even better that s a great photograph
1	that s erm
1	just just great
1	but they they tell me that in peak flow the water would be coming over here as well
1	wow
1	and if the wind is coming you wouldn t want to take your camera out
1	you d get drenched
1	because you d probably probably get drenched yeah
1	superb
1	yeah
1	just superb
1	i i i i enjoyed printing those off and well making the selections i should say
1	you sent them away to be printed
1	yes i use erm snapfish and erm i i had about seventy of these ten by eights done and they only cost me er thirty quid
1	definitely worth it
1	yeah it s erm it it s er
1	i mean when you see it on the screen it s it s more encompassing you can t really riffle through them in the same way
1	no and in fact with some of the others erm you know anon nametype f type name s mother was quite aged now and she s not into computers and things like that and so i ll send a few photographs with a commentary up to her because she likes that kind of stuff
1	yes yes that s nice yes that s right yes
1	erm so i won t keep i ll probably keep these but there are there are another thirty odd that weren t quite as good as i thought they were going to be or they were duplicating this stuff
1	yes that s right
1	you know
1	i think you re right to be as selective as you possibly can
1	yeah
1	because that means each one has got its own you know impact without it being diluted by seeing similar
1	yeah yeah i i mean i think that s right i mean i had another three or four of the rocks but i thought well they re interesting to me but you ve seen one rock formation you don t want to see another three or four you know
1	and some of those if the resolution is good not probably the one that had like the rhino but could be mounted in some way
1	yeah i mean in the past i ve had real favourites put in a frame and i ve kept unclear
1	you ve got a couple in your room
1	i have i ve got a few in the room and i ve got one or two in the house but but i have to stop myself though because you know i mean you could come to my house and then think anon nametype m type name s starting up a shop for africana you know
1	vocal desc laugh
1	because i i mean i trunc di trunc i didn t buy a great deal
1	no no
1	in zimbabwe
1	right right
1	but it was just as well because when i came back i thought oh i ve got another carved
1	vocal desc laugh
1	it s a it s a teak bowl it s another one it s beautiful and it s teak it s fantastic hmm well i suppose if i took that one and put it upstairs out of the way i could put that you know i mean i am i am more or less full up
1	yeah yes yes up there well yes but these aren t like you see the nice object in a in john lewis and you thought oh i like that s it s a very different kind of thing this is a genuine memento i suppose too
1	mm yeah yeah yeah
1	just a nice object which you find in a shop in britain it s a different kettle of fish entirely
1	i i i bought a a i brought a bowl back for anon nametype f type name
1	mm
1	and erm so i gave her the bowl and she was really very pleased and then the next day i thought oh i never told her about it so i sent an email saying it was i d bought it in the anon type place village where mr anon nametype m type name had taken he s the head man he d taken us around and introduced us to his wife anon nametype f type name and then we did this that and the other and then we ended up in this little market place and the woman there said it was made from redwood and they d polish it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and they get the colours from boot polish
1	oh christ
1	which they rub in erm you know and and and that s what i brought and and she said oh trunc wha trunc what a back story this is wonderful
1	there s so much to pause dur short exactly
1	you know so it s i thought you know i suppose more than a bowl in some respect you know
1	i mean compared to the back story well it was on the third shelf up in john lewis you know when you walk past things
1	yeah yeah it is a bit different yeah
1	like those big giraffes you see on the floor and erm ceramic tigers
1	yeah and in and in pause dur short yeah and in and in and in john lewis is probably nearer a hundred dollars or the equivalent rather than nearer what i paid for it
1	that s right and although the original
1	yeah
1	buyer wouldn t have paid as less as you paid for it so
1	yeah no
1	terrific really wonderful
1	but er yeah so erm did you see your er third year dissertation students and how many have you got
1	well there s lots of students anon nametype m type name unclear rest of our unclear staff so it had to be more this year than it would normally be so it s ten
1	oh i ve got eleven this year but that s
1	again you re in the same position as we are
1	yeah yeah yeah that s right erm i saw most of them one or two couldn t turn up so i ll trunc i trunc i ll see those on monday so you know it s not too bad erm
1	i think if you split them into two groups it s doable six and five
1	yeah well i i m going to see them individually after all this
1	are you
1	yeah yeah
1	that s a lot of work
1	i i only see them well trunc i trunc i m trunc i trunc i m just used to it trunc i trunc i stack them up like planes at heathrow if you see what i mean trunc be trunc trunc w trunc say say i ve got eleven when things start warming up there ll be five or six who are all finishing work in trunc w trunc in one week and i ll have you know someone two o clock someone two thirty someone three o clock someone three thirty four o clock four thirty and then i ve done that group then you see and i ll have readied i ll have read their stuff the the the day before and er made comments on it and stuff like that
1	but i m seeing them every week
1	trunc i trunc i ll probably see them every other week
1	okay well that s more doable okay
1	yeah i in i could see them every week but i think it would only be if they came to me and said i m trunc i trunc i m writing this i want to ask your advice about it
1	yeah yeah
1	because normally the deadlines that we agree together they need more than one week in order to produce
1	okay
1	a particular piece of work
1	right
1	they meet weekly with anon nametype n type name and the others doing the dissertation module which is a different thing from the dissertation supervision
1	okay
1	but now i don t know whether your unclear soc sci unclear people do that erm but there is a dissertation module which anon nametype n type name and maybe anon nametype m type name have something to do with and it s
1	unclear cell unclear
1	and it some of it is subject specific
1	right
1	and some of it is general so plagiarism would be general
1	okay yeah
1	now the first meeting was today eleven till one
1	ah
1	so but the first meeting today was meet your supervisors so i happened to see mine in the morning and then cos i had to go to sainsbury s at for elevenish so i couldn t see them then erm
1	well that clarifies something which was a bit unclear in my mind because they my students were talking about this thing i thought i better not interfere
1	yeah
1	so there is this thing with with putting as a department with representatives from each group
1	well i trunc th trunc trunc i trunc trunc i trunc i don t know the full ins and outs of it erm if i trunc g trunc if i remember when i go back i ll might forward you the email er which which which might give you some idea about the structure erm but i know various people are contributing there is stuff on plagiarism and erm might be people from the library coming down to do stuff on
1	it s sort of unclear is that right
1	yeah well i suppose it yes in a way it is er but it would be subject specific erm no sorry erm but it would be dissertation specific and trunc i trunc i think when it comes to say quant methods there was one bit of the timetable i saw where it said erm discourse soc sci students and discourse analysis and then it was what would it be erm content analysis cms you know and i m talking very very roughly now
1	dissertation specific pause dur short yeah yeah yeah
1	and i thought oh yeah well i could see how they d split up into that
1	right
1	you know so if i if i can find that trunc e trunc i get so much as programme director i only keep stuff that i know
1	yeah
1	is going to be but if i find it i ll forward it to you so you get some idea of what is going on
1	it sounds like a good idea in so far as
1	i think so yeah
1	there will be commonalities in the
1	yeah exactly
1	so all confront like plagiarism for example and using the library and so on although many of our our our students probably yours as well have come across well google search you know google scholar or
1	yeah yeah
1	but they haven t all come across web science and psych info in ours
1	well no no that s true
1	and that can be something which they wouldn t otherwise know about unless somebody told them
1	no trunc i trunc trunc i trunc i think for the you know the more keen trunc an trunc or the better students that they ll get a lot more out of it my i may have got this wrong but my impression is there is a light touch to this because i know part of it is about dropping stuff and and anon nametype f type name was saying she ll be available
1	yes
1	but you re not mandated to come so i mean the ten weeks it s not a it s not a heavy duty ticking the register kind of thing at least i trunc don trunc i didn t get that impression but er it s there you know for for people
1	but you know our experiences when we have these drop things is that a most students don t turn up and b
1	that s true
1	the students don t go the ones who do go
1	yeah
1	if you unclear at least because they re they know what their problem is and they could probably solve it by themselves
1	it it
1	the take up is usually something like twenty percent
1	i think this might trunc i trunc i mean some of it is mandated as in you should go to this and and some of it might be a drop in clinic or clinic about x y or z and i think that looser function might have been because last year it was all mandatory and the people weren t turning up and anon nametype f type name was there fiddling her fingers kind of thing
1	right right pause dur short so she might as well turn it into a non mandatory
1	yeah yeah
1	and then okay
1	but i m not absolutely sure i couldn t i mean it it in horror it came to me and i thought this is the first i have heard what i m not doing this way and then i saw anon nametype f type name s name and i thought oh yeah it s anon nametype f type name who does this so er so she s
1	well it s good of her though cos she s got plenty on her plate without that kind of stuff as well
1	yeah but she seems you know quite keen to do it really to to to bring their skills on
1	right yeah that s what she s like she ll do oodles of work
1	yeah yeah that s right
1	anything happening about the chair advert
1	oh er yeah well i think it s erm i think the advert is out there now
1	that s good
1	and also the one to replace anon nametype m type name with the lectureship
1	excellent excellent
1	erm they ve both been advertised so we know dates for interviews and we ve got the process what s happening now is that er various of my colleagues are trying to approach people individually
1	good i think that s
1	and say are you interested in applying and they are trying to get an assessor i mean i i i got in touch with anon nametype m type name who would ve been brilliant he s going to be external examiner for anon nametype m type name but he can t do it
1	okay
1	unfortunately but they ll anon nametype m type name or someone like that might well do it you know
1	what about your internal sorry your external examiner for for the programme
1	er well that would have been an obvious choice i don t know whether that s allowed or not i don t know erm anyway that s passed that s passed out of my hands now to the likes of anon nametype f type name and and anon nametype m type name who who know more about the field
1	right
1	than i do
1	right
1	you know erm and so
1	i think supplementing the broadcast and with the odd email
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	and did you know this is working this is happening that kind of thing anon nametype f type name put it on twitter all these things help
1	yeah i agree
1	you want some a large er field as possible
1	yeah
1	both to get the best candidate and also politically because it is important to show
1	and that s right and anon nametype m type name is going to be on the interview panel for the professorship and i m going to do the one for the lectureship which i m you know happy
1	excellent it s crucial to have one of you on the panel
1	yeah yeah
1	it would make no sense at all because who knows what criteria they would use without somebody who is on the teaching side say look this person wonderful though she is or he is just couldn t do the teaching
1	yes or they could do the teaching and they are wonderful but my god it s another horror name like we ve had in the past and the alarm bells are going off in my head saying no no no no no no no
1	vocal desc laugh would you insist on seeing a picture of these applicants just in case they ve changed their names unclear vocal desc laugh
1	that er that plastic surgery doesn t fool me name of certain person which won t be er mentioned now for reasons of fairness
1	vocal desc laugh of posterity and
1	yes exactly yeah indeed indeed yeah
1	excellent
1	thank you very much for the coffee and the belgian chocolate
1	oh there is more to come well there s trunc so trunc some water
1	okay thanks very much indeed anon nametype m type name i shall see you again shortly
1	my pleasure yes indeed
1	cheers mate
1	cheers
1	want me to leave your door open
1	do cheers mate

1	right
1	so there you are
1	so erm anon nametype m type name was saying from beginning to end it only took twenty minutes
1	oh it s a bit longer than that i went in at about twenty to three trunc li trunc they put the drops in and erm it all ran down the side of my face and went in my ear i thought and trunc li trunc i ll have a numb ear but it didn t
1	right
1	but it did numb the eye and the top of my head i went to scratch the top of my head afterwards and i thought it s gone
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh yeah er it was interesting let s put it that way i was quite apprehensive as first one but you don t see anything
1	no
1	and erm all you see is a light shining in your bad eye
1	yeah
1	and you can see movement or stuff coming towards it and going away but you can t make out any details and there s no pain or discomfort even
1	right
1	they re remarkable
1	right right and what s your vision like today in that eye
1	it er better than it s been for a long long time
1	really
1	mm
1	really
1	yeah
1	so you were telling me on the way here what can you can and can t do
1	i can t drive as i said for another day
1	yeah
1	erm pause dur short mustn t lift anything heavy
1	right
1	but i ve got a son to do that anyway
1	yeah
1	er pause dur short and that s about it really
1	right
1	nothing else just you know be sensible
1	right okay
1	mustn t rub it obviously
1	oh of course yeah
1	and i ve got to wear a a plastic lens to stop me rubbing it inadvertently overnight
1	right right
1	and that s vocal desc laugh that s held on with
1	sticky tape is it
1	with sticky tape
1	yeah
1	and i woke up just before i got up and i thought oh it s gone
1	yeah
1	i felt around and i couldn t find it
1	yeah
1	and when i saw the wife cos she always er gets up very early she said you lost your eye patch in the night i said yeah i know i did she said i saw something glinting on my arm and it was stuck to it vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i said well what are you trying to do to me in the night
1	vocal desc laugh
1	she says no i m more like the other way round but i have no recollection
1	no recollection of it at all
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh dear it s funny i i i remember years ago i had to wear a brace at night you know when i was a kid
1	yeah
1	to keep my teeth straight
1	yeah
1	and it was always the other side of the room in the morning and i couldn t understand how it got the other side of the room
1	no
1	erm but erm you know that there you go
1	strange well
1	it is strange
1	it s not only humans that move around in the night dogs do as well
1	oh do they
1	yeah because when i or a few years ago i had terrible sciatica and i couldn t lie down and i spent night after night sitting sleeping in the chair
1	right
1	and the two dogs were there and the number of times i woke up and they were on the move
1	were they
1	yeah trunc th trunc yeah we put a a throw on the settee
1	yeah
1	and they sleep on that they ve got a big bed in the kitchen they sometimes sleep on that
1	yeah
1	they re going backwards and forwards and then they they go to sleep on the on the floor they re er quite remarkable
1	really
1	yeah
1	goodness
1	yeah
1	er our dog never seemed to he always slept on his bed erm well when i saw him erm he didn t like being woken up in the night
1	no
1	erm vocal desc laugh
1	well our older one trunc s trunc very often he goes to sleep on the settee in the evening
1	yeah mm
1	on his back
1	yeah
1	he s a labrador quite big
1	yeah
1	and his jowls flop open so his teeth are sticking up in the air
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and then four legs in the air vocal desc laugh
1	wow
1	and he s got teeth out of all proportion to his size
1	has he
1	he s got huge teeth yeah
1	right right
1	vocal desc laugh
1	tell me i ve been meaning to ask you did you find your erm brass plaques
1	no i didn t
1	no well i m sorry i failed you but i had a look
1	that s alright
1	i thought about them in the night and erm pause dur short and i i i what came into my head was this immediately it s always the first thing that comes into your head and it doesn t always work erm have you somewhere at home got a a container like a tank erm it s like a sort of erm
1	yes
1	er trunc i trunc trunc i trunc trunc i trunc in a building i and either an outbuilding or a garage and i i just that s what came into my head so they could
1	yeah there s there s one not far from the green baize
1	really
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh good lord vocal desc laugh
1	i mean the green baize is anon nametype m type name s railway i mean i ve built that railway for him when he was a child
1	yeah
1	and he s thirty four years old now and he won t get rid of it
1	right
1	never used disconnected from everything
1	right
1	on its end
1	right
1	but that the that s a an old door plus an extension
1	yeah
1	covered in green baize with all the
1	right
1	the trunc s trunc the rest of the stuff built on it
1	right
1	and that is behind the computers there are two computers on a stand and i thought no it can t be behind there there s not enough room but i m sure they re in that room somewhere but it s
1	right
1	er jokingly called a third bedroom
1	right
1	you know it it s pause dur short my parents in when they were alive had an old persons flat and they had a
1	right
1	cupboard bigger than that bedroom
1	right oh i see
1	so i m sure yeah but there is a big white plastic thing on top of there
1	right right
1	a cupboard
1	right
1	and it s full of well what i call junk and anon nametype f type name calls stuff
1	oh right i see
1	in fact i don t very often don t use a work as polite as that but erm
1	vocal desc laugh well the the i read a book one about cheese it was called who stole my cheese no who moved my cheese have you read that
1	i think i have i can t recall it but there s yes i think i have
1	and cheese that s gets left around a long time and not used trunc i trunc is is really sort of ripe cheese
1	well it walks out doesn t it
1	it walks out exactly erm and it s erm so we often say there s a lot of old cheese in the attack we trunc m trunc we ve got to shift or there s a lot of old cheese you know
1	yeah
1	we re always saying things like that
1	i m not as polite as that
1	you re not no vocal desc laugh
1	no as you ve heard this morning i forgot you were here sorry about that
1	no i didn t even hear you erm i m i i swear myself i went to drama school years ago
1	yeah
1	and we did a lot of swearing because we had to swear on stage
1	yeah
1	so you know you you you just tended
1	well
1	to to carry on swearing erm so getting back to this pause dur short stuff i did see the floor and i saw the green baize
1	yeah
1	but then i saw the tank
1	yeah
1	the other night so if
1	trunc s trunc the only reason
1	you ever get in there you might find it
1	i m looking for them is that anon nametype m type name is missing your anon nametype m type name is missing a certain range i ve said well i might have them if i ve
1	yes
1	got them
1	yeah
1	he can have them
1	oh that s so kind of you
1	but i couldn t find them
1	he s desperate for them trunc w trunc every time we go to a junk shop round anon type place and there s a
1	yeah
1	a a box full of er of horse brasses
1	yeah
1	he looks in there
1	he did give me a list i don t promise i ve got them and the chances are i haven t but ah there it is pause dur short oh it isn t
1	do you you everyone gets the same at these rallies don t they
1	yes
1	they re not
1	but
1	different for different
1	i ve been going to rallies long before i finished the erm the traction engines
1	right
1	because i don t know whether you remember pause dur short a member long dead called anon nametype m type name
1	no
1	he used to go along to rallies with a tableful of hot air engines and i used to tag along with him and i had a couple of stationary engines that i used to run on a little fridge trunc compres trunc compressor pause dur short erm so they go back a long long time back to the
1	mm
1	mid eighties
1	right
1	so it s possible i ve got something he s after but i won t know till i find them
1	no no i see oh well unclear let it go unclear er
1	i mean i ve started saying to rallies now they they put on do you want a plaque and i always put no cos
1	yeah
1	i dunno what to do with them
1	no no exactly exactly erm well that s that s right i mean erm anon nametype m type name wants to trunc m trunc mount them all up and when we take the austin seven out he want to
1	yeah
1	have them there
1	yeah
1	on show
1	yeah
1	that s that s the plan anyway

1	the only one plaque i ve got on my pause dur short well i ve got two a sticker on one of my trollies that a carry coal and stuff around in so
1	yeah

1	and on the back of it that anon nametype f type name got me it said pause dur short what is it nothing beats a good a wife and a steam engine or vice versa or something like
1	vocal desc laugh
1	something like that
1	vocal desc laugh

1	yes
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	it s the same colour as the
1	i think it was done with that in mind to merge everything in
1	yeah exactly to make everything look
1	yeah
1	a bit
1	yeah
1	cohesive really but then they went for these erm bright blue railings didn t they

0	yeah
0	if they don t do their own job they re fired pause dur short end of story
0	yeah

0	a hundred pounds hundred pounds
0	i ve chased it up with our payroll and i ve said have you charged me at forty percent rather than twenty percent um and they said yeah we ve charged you at twenty percent pause dur short and it ll be your national insurance which is twelve percent and your student loan which is nine percent
0	oh my god
0	cos i need to get out of my overdraft this year pause dur short that was the plan pause dur short tut fine pause dur short it just pisses me off
0	do they
0	it s such a piss take
0	they re the tax office

0	something s happened pause dur short right basically i ve got two accounts
0	which are both at their overdraft limit pause dur short as usual
0	yeah
0	mm
0	tut
0	no
0	cos they just basically write to me and tell me they d trunc s trunc they d changed the terms pause dur short but there s fuck all you can do about it because you need your overdraft pause dur short so if er cos if if you re fifteen hundred pounds into your overdraft which thankfully i m not anymore and then they say right well actually the interest free bit s over now pause dur short bye bye pause dur short we re gonna start charging you at nineteen percent pause dur short you re fucked pause dur short there s nothing you can do
0	really
0	over to interest pause dur short er which is what i was expecting to be doing them to do at five hundred pound intervals
0	oh shit pause dur short yeah pause dur short if they do that i m fucked
0	for doing it
0	i know pause dur short absolute bullshit pause dur short so i m gonna write them a letter pause dur short i m just gonna say to them cos the thing is as well it s really irresponsible lending if that s what they re
0	that there is no way on god s earth that i can afford to pay out a hundred and fifty quid
0	mm
0	no
0	she didn t have any money coming in and er they were just like oh yeah well that s the terms of the agreement pause dur short sorry love pause dur short on your bike pause dur short so she s now with the co op pause dur short who don t charge
0	yeah
0	but
0	i know pause dur short my ex boyfriend managed to get in there just at the last minute pause dur short but i was looking at this on the money saving expert pause dur short because i you know i ve trunc g trunc everyone s got bank charges pause dur short i ve got bank charges that i d like to claim pause dur short and it said on occasion you can send your claim to the ombudsman pause dur short and they look at it all pause dur short so if you trunc s trunc were to say you know i ve trunc d trunc i m in a very fragile delicate position pause dur short because they re more likely to look at the ones for people who can t afford to pay these charges pause dur short which you can t pause dur short you know
0	if it ever comes back on me i can say look i i tried to do the responsible thing and sort this out
0	cos i don t know what the hell you did but you knowing
0	mm
0	and the worst part is i think
0	mm
0	which bounced
0	legally they re not allowed to reclaim for that cheque because they are aware then pause dur short they have the knowledge that you don t have the funds
0	did they
0	i think that s where
0	so they say you know maybe maybe you would want to write a an initial letter and then write them again and say well actually it s good isn t it pause dur short it s my mum and she ll only complain because of my phone pause dur short so you can see that my phone is still here pause dur short it s not with vodafone
0	yeah right pause dur short i trunc w trunc but we ll escalate your call and someone will call you back pause dur short obviously no one s called
0	so young anon nametype m type name who i spoke to today he said oh no there s never anyone here to speak to pause dur short so whatever that guy told me the other day was absolute bollocks pause dur short you have to go on the website and fill it in in an e mail pause dur short and i said is this one of the ones that goes into the ether and no one ever replies because you can fuck off pause dur short i m not filling that in pause dur short and he said no you know i ve i ve filled it in pause dur short and said what you work for vodafone
0	yeah pause dur short i know
0	yeah
0	so and of course they don t collect on the weekends cos that d be you know
0	to give you my phone pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	it s probably not standard if you can t hear me pause dur short and all you can hear is your own voice
0	that s probably not standard is it you fucking retard
0	twat
0	i spoke to my trunc sc trunc high school today
0	at the authorities for when they trunc r trunc release the league tables every year
0	mm
0	no way
0	yes we do have them pause dur short so then i said right fucking fantastic pause dur short do you wanna get those over to me they need to be with a letter pause dur short headed paper pause dur short signed by anon nametype n type name pause dur short get it in the post
0	right pause dur short well pause dur short this girl was so painfully stupid
0	painfully dim
0	really slow
0	yeah pause dur short my trunc go trunc vocal desc laugh and she kept slurp slurp
0	yeah
0	so she first she told me that that would be they ve got other priorities basically than to write me a letter
0	yeah
0	just print it on headed paper pause dur short get it to anon nametype f type name pause dur short get her to sign it pause dur short send it off
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	so because you can t walk down the corridor
0	cos that s absolute bullshit
0	yeah
0	mm
0	and then if all else fails at life at your end
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	you ve told me you don t have them
0	i know it is i know it is
0	vocal desc laugh
0	in an archive pause dur short oh no
0	um that there are vocal desc laugh really a lot of them
0	i mean they re not just vocal desc laugh
0	okay so don t worry pause dur short i tell you what pause dur short we ll get the a level ones on their way
0	mm
0	it s in a shed
0	i though oh my god pause dur short if she gets me on
0	your life is
0	vocal desc laugh
0	and so i made her vocal desc laugh put it all in writing
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	um pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	of paper i will be in this position chasing things in january pause dur short i have an official application going through and i m requesting information pause dur short it s not a choice
0	mm
0	and then you ll be obliged to do it pause dur short so i m basically giving you a head s up
0	right pause dur short well i ll see what we can do pause dur short she just wasn t getting it pause dur short it s as if she it wasn t her job to do it pause dur short as if she wasn t the person
0	yeah
0	well at least you ve got it in writing pause dur short huh
0	yeah pause dur short i thought also about
0	how frustrating
0	yeah
0	i thought i ll keep the i ll print the and just say look i don t know what type of staff you re employing but there s trunc cl trunc clearly a bit of a communication problem here
0	mm
0	to collect it i will be claiming back my mileage
0	oh right
0	i can t believe they need your certificates from school when you ve got a degree
0	but they ve said you know if we don t have the certificates this is the next best thing pause dur short a letter from your school pause dur short you d think thanks for that bit of leeway
0	i mean i m really ridiculous with things like that pause dur short so i ve kept all mine pause dur short but
0	i think anon nametype f type name might have them
0	but no we don t wanna go down that road
0	i mean you re better off you know you d prefer to be on the phone to some retard than having to actually you know strike up communication with your mum
0	so worst case scenario gonna go
0	where s your school wrexham
0	yeah pause dur short near sheffield pause dur short um
0	uh
0	oh
0	i can t decide now
0	it s problematic pause dur short and he was like right okay pause dur short i said so i m gonna come in and see you pause dur short what are you doing on friday cos i ve got the day off pause dur short and he said right let me just get your paperwork pause dur short did you pass your recruit test yeah pause dur short what did you get and i thought i can t tell you cos i m not supposed to know pause dur short i know i passed it
0	mm
0	um and he said okay pause dur short well don t worry pause dur short um have you had a look on the website done it pause dur short and every other website in the world pause dur short yes pause dur short and he was like vocal desc laugh right er
0	and get it clear in your mind
0	unclear
0	i i think i would have more fun
0	so it s only trunc gon trunc if you are only gonna sign up for four years
0	you want to make the most of that
0	trunc w trunc you wanna have the best time
0	yeah
0	make it your career pause dur short but if you re only gonna do it for four years
0	mm
0	mm
0	and if you don t like the people you work with cos er per vessel per ship there s only eighteen officers out of the two hundred people on that ship
0	wow
0	and trunc s trunc satellite navigation stuff
0	ultimately pause dur short but um what was i gonna say like what would your responsibilities be if you were just ratings like what would you be doing what would your job be
0	that s what i wanna know
0	oh right
0	shit
0	yeah pause dur short two and a half hours pause dur short i mean a lot of it was not navy related
0	mm
0	then it s really changed pause dur short so you d be he said i don t trunc kn trunc i can t tell you pause dur short er he was like
0	oh okay
0	so the progression path for both is different
0	mm
0	and they just trunc p trunc they spend a lot a lot of time planning pause dur short and i am a planner pause dur short i do it now pause dur short it fucks me off though fucks me off
0	right
0	mm
0	mm pause dur short seems a bit redundant doesn t it
0	but then i suppose that s that s the nature of the beast isn t it pause dur short they rely on people like you pause dur short like you could spin it on its head pause dur short yeah the your test doesn t come up but it means that you re prepared because it could and in fact in real life it could pause dur short so it s better
0	yeah

1	okay
1	but the problem i had was that when i did it before my well basically anon nametype m type name told me how to do it and i wrote it down pause dur short but when i got my new computer i found although i didn t realise at the time that the problem was that my phone was not synced or synchronised into my new computer so it was basically just a a question of going to a i think it was settings and just click on something that says synchronise your phone to this computer but the guy had spent two hours trying to figure it out how to do it and didn t didn t know that you know really he was supposed to be a computer expert but we spent all that afternoon you know a couple of hours over two hours trying to figure out how to do it and he downloaded trunc i trunc itunes and all the rest of it which i didn t need and didn t want and then had to get rid of it so in the end so i went to apple shop on the other day on friday and he said yeah easy enough bom bom bom bom bom pause dur short and then i came home and my phone was now synced is now synced to my computer and any any future times i just i put the recordings in and and i can trunc acc trunc them straight away access them straight away pause dur short you know it s like most things isn t it easy when you know how

1	i thought it was one of your favourite topics
1	mm pause dur short depends on your mind set i suppose if your mind s totally obsessed with one s own problems you just tend to concentrate on others
1	right pause dur long mm pause dur long vocal desc cough ah
1	constant pain is it
1	constant never goes away i can get comfy in bed and i can go to sleep and then i wake in the night and it s fucking bad pause dur short bastard innit i think that s the answer lose weight

1	no it s that s it isn t it absolutely absolutely no doubt absolutely i don t know why my nails are so filthy i don t know what i ve been doing to get my nails so filthy it must have been that job i did yesterday i need to clip my nails always need clipping and cleaning always they seem to grow
1	clip round the bloody ear
1	seem to grow overnight
1	apparently they still grow when we re dead
1	yeah yeah pause dur short but would that be after cremation or
1	vocal desc laugh have you got any preference you re going to be buried aren t you next to your father
1	yeah but in a box of ashes if they d allow me
1	oh really
1	to put those in the grave yeah pause dur short there s in the headstone for my name pause dur long
1	i suppose once you re gone it doesn t really make much difference does it
1	not really pause dur short it s for the living
1	yeah that s right pause dur long well i m going to go and get myself a little bit more veg
1	yeah go for it mate do it do it do it
1	won t be a mo
1	great pause dur long
1	right there we go obviously anon nametype m type name has changed his mind having gone off with his plate pause dur short so much for cutting down on the amount pause dur short does talking to yourself constitute a conversation pause dur long don t worry he ll be back in a minute pause dur short ah
1	curry sauce and chips that s what i ve got curry sauce and chips pause dur short ah pause dur long so how does how does that chinese cooking and preparation of the vegetable differ from the preparation erm erm
1	well it tends to be all pretty much the same in terms of pause dur short cooking nearly everything s fried
1	in china
1	yeah
1	right what like stir fried with a very small amount of oil isn t it
1	erm probably pause dur short i think traditionally there was being not obese was in trunc con trunc stark contrast to westerners but they are starting to to now because of like everybody else they eat masses of erm fast food especially the kids
1	right pause dur short yeah
1	they re following the west
1	really
1	for good and for bad pause dur short well mostly bad i suppose depending on your point of view
1	mother s day today do they have that in china
1	oh yeah
1	oh what same day
1	i presume so
1	so it s the end of their new year now
1	yeah it s finished everyone is back school is back to back to work
1	when did when does that finish
1	i think erm half way through february
1	oh right
1	well anon nametype f type name went back to school this week so maybe i don t know maybe pause dur short most of february so pause dur long i m certainly glad i missed that those bloody fireworks are just incessant and it builds up every day gets a little bit more until the big day and
1	yes you re not a fan of celebration really are you
1	not really no
1	no
1	i think it s not the celebration of it that i don t really enjoy i certainly like celebrating as much as anybody but it s the organised celebrations that i i don t like cos trunc ever trunc well usually everybody is expected to behave in a prescribed manner
1	which is
1	well you have to try and maintain harmony and er pause dur short happiness even though you know like as in the west at christmas time most family feuds ll rekindle themselves don t they at christmas so pause dur short i think to a certain extent it happens in china as well but not to such a great extent because they don t base all their celebrations on alcohol like we do pause dur short and they re also the family value system is they they try and maintain the this thing about harmony which is in my way of thinking just a fa ade
1	well yeah it s it s just that s not value that you you consider practising yourself
1	well if it i i think that if you re going to do this it should be done as much as you can nearly every day of the year not just in one time of year it s like christmas
1	yes
1	peace and and love and goodwill for men why is it just at christmas
1	yeah yeah why is it christmas yeah pause dur short sure pause dur long
1	but bloody fireworks drive me mad
1	yes
1	cos you can t
1	is it the noise you can t stand
1	yeah mm
1	yes
1	amazing peaceful in anon type place even where we are in the centre of anon type place so quiet
1	yes yes yeah pause dur short well we re not in the centre really are we we re not in the anon type place or anywhere like that that s the sort of
1	well i d say off anon type place road s pretty central
1	yeah i suppose you re right yeah that s true
1	eleven o clock at night you can hear a pin drop outside
1	yes
1	in china my god everywhere s buzzing
1	really why why do they why do they keep going twenty four hours do they
1	well not twenty four hours but certainly into the early hours
1	yes pause dur long
1	yeah they work amazingly hard generally the chinese
1	yes pause dur long look at that fucking great wall they built look at that
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yeah well you can say the same about the egyptians
1	yeah and the egyptians pause dur short isis are going to demolish them aren t they the pyramids
1	are they
1	i think so
1	they ll have a hard job how would you demolish a pyramid
1	dynamite
1	size of those you d have to have a hell of a lot of dynamite
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	the size of them
1	yeah islamic state s going to demolish them
1	ha
1	there s no one guarding tripoli no one s in tripoli at the moment they can just walk straight in there there s no americans or english you know defence there pause dur short libya they can walk straight in can t they are the pyramids in near libya well it s near egypt isn t it ah

1	well you need to start oh god
1	i m going to go to the doctor and say look this pain is getting worse and worse and worse
1	of course when did it start getting worse
1	well it gets worse all the time i thought it would go away i thought i had pulled my shoulder it s been about ache or pause dur short now it s spreading down my arm it s down into my shoulder i can hardly move it you can see how much i can move it if this arm does the same i m fucked seriously fucked pause dur short ah

1	there you go thank you
1	thank you
1	ah fuck me pause dur long yeah we ll go and see the doctor see the doctor tuesday

1	i can t i thought i d get over it i can t it s getting worse and fucking worse and worse i had to put in some of that gel which was good it s like a chilling gel something like that deep heat or something you know it seems to work
1	why don t you go tomorrow morning
1	well i suppose i could really yeah i suppose i could but i want to wash i want to get myself prepared i ve got to get to anon nametype m type name s by eleven which means getting out the front door by ten
1	that s alright you have to be there at half past eight don t you you re up usually by then
1	yeah but it s a rush it s unclear i just want to get up slowly wash dress take my time focus prepare myself for a speech a eulogy it may albeit short and erm just rumble off the road get on the bus get to anon nametype m type name s
1	well it s not exactly to look forward to is it
1	well i quite it s for the living isn t it funerals are for the living they re not for the dead
1	no
1	er although having said that you don t know you don t know how long
1	has she got much family
1	a sister
1	is that it
1	as far as i m aware yeah pause dur short some people don t have that but she didn t talk to her sister for a long time she certainly didn t tell her she was dying so erm er her sister was a bit miffed and a bit peeved by her erm then pause dur long hopefully she ll get over it pause dur short so you know pause dur short i don t know why was anon nametype f type name an alcoholic why did she get swept away on it you know what was that all about sad isn t it
1	i don t know pause dur short don t they reckon that some is i suppose most of it s erm in your dna that some people are more prone to doing whatever than others
1	yes yes i mean brief
1	unclear and suddenly i mean to a greater extent
1	even if they have a pretty
1	after after that we had our fair share of pints and booze in general and yet we never got addicted to it
1	well there is that there is that pause dur short i suppose in my life i have been addicted to booze at various times i remember waking up in the morning and thinking i have to drink erm but
1	it s a psychological dependence when you start unclear
1	but i think cos certainly at the end of the day i would just go and have a beer pause dur short and unclear you know one beer leads to another i could never just have a beer and feel chilled i d have to have i d have to get pissed pause dur short and i and at the end when i drank i used to go out by myself go to the pub drink by myself to get pissed and you realise how how miserable that was you see i see other people who are drinkers who go there to drink to get pissed and it s very it s sad very insular to do that isn t it it s very pause dur short so erm yeah so but thankfully i m not er i don t do that anymore er but i have periods when i when i get pissed very occasionally pause dur short think but that that s only happened once in the last years and years i didn t you know years and years and years so er no i agree that there are there are things in your in your genes that can influence that erm you know if that s what they tell us but i think that there are things that er i think there are also psychological reasons why we drink as well
1	of course
1	and i don t think it s only just the one thing i think it s and i think you know if you look at anon nametype f type name she went out with anon nametype m type name for a long time and you know i i he wasn t er he didn t treat women nicely erm so you think well she she accepted that but they did row they did have rows but she still went out with him being you know with his with his attitude and everything and i think well vocal desc laugh she didn t have much self respect did she you know erm neither did anon nametype m type name pause dur short but er you know so i think i think people pause dur short i drank for a to try and get some self respect in in a crazy way i mean in and the madness of it is is you when you drink you trunc los trunc the more you lose your self respect vocal desc laugh
1	yeah
1	it s madness isn t it sort of weird psychology weird stuff
1	especially if you remember everything you did or said
1	oh thank god i don t i mean i i yeah god terrible trunc dr trunc dreadful dreadful pause dur short yeah well er you know pause dur short i blame the society i was brought up in i blame it all for for everything bad that i ve learnt i blame it for for giving a man the power sadist to beat a fucking six year old child you know if you that s what jimmy saville got put away for vocal desc laugh well perhaps not beating but you know and they that was and there were people wanting to bring that back corporal punishment and what corporal punishment does is when you get beaten is it makes you hate the institution hate
1	that s what the second world war was
1	what corporal punishment vocal desc laugh corporal hitler
1	corporal hitler
1	ah you know what was that all about pause dur short what made him do that how was he treated as a kid and i i think we should forgive him i think we should do national things to forgive him to feel sorry for him and to forgive him because if you keep hating something in an idea that s what you can do you keep on hating hating them don t you just hating the live and er you know christ came along and does does his thing saying er not to hate
1	yeah
1	forgive them you know and er turn the other cheek blah blah blah and that s what you ought to do you ought to have a er national day where we forgive hitler and see where it went wrong for him
1	that would be controversial
1	well why do we accept hating him and retribution why do we make praise those things that s in the new the old testament isn t it vengeance is mine sayeth the lord eye for an eye tooth for a oath well you know look look look where it got the jews that philosophy
1	blind and toothless
1	unclear and look unclear yeah here s my boy vocal desc laugh well look at where it got them you know pause dur short what if you inherit the earth but lose your soul

1	forgive hitler yes
1	go back

0	bam
0	no
0	you want the fun dates and
0	mm
0	maybe she s got nothing to compare it to

0	vocal desc laugh
0	but not unclear
0	it s more it s more difficult to do that isn t it
0	and that s all you can do pause dur short and you re but the thing is the good thing is about it doing it regularly is you do see an improvement pause dur short you know
0	mm
0	mm
0	yeah
0	two day death
0	and the thing that i don t get is they give you that table of the different age brackets
0	yeah
0	it s for everybody pause dur short yeah
0	yeah
0	and they re not the ones who ve got the brain cells pause dur short so they might look fit pause dur short they might run quite quickly pause dur short but they ll you know
0	that s it
0	that s it pause dur short game over pause dur short that s all they ve got to contribute
0	i mean i was thinking about it logically pause dur short and if you got there with a really positive attitude pause dur short really give it everything
0	mm
0	even if you re not quite cutting the mustard or you re coming bottom of the class they want to see that you re a that you re a really motivated determinate person
0	yeah pause dur short rather than superman
0	unclear

0	that s really the attitude you should have
0	they ll take a lot of things into consideration pause dur short which i guess is why you have so many hoops to jump through pause dur short they ll take it all into account
0	mm
0	whereas people that find it difficult to think strategically
0	mm
0	it it must be difficult to to teach yourself that pause dur short i m i m sure that must be a skill that either are good at or you re not good at
0	yeah
0	it s gonna be a fucking killer
0	but you are gonna be a machine pause dur short unclear really

0	okay
1	okay is that recording now or is it doing something
1	trunc u trunc i wonder if i can do rp now and get rid of my accent
1	yes pause dur short that would fox everybody
1	vocal desc laugh unclear can t don t know if i can unclear
1	vocal desc laugh
1	unclear okay unclear
1	okay so right pause dur short erm pause dur short there are there are pause dur short kind of two things really to unclear pan unclear out today i suppose which is number one these consultation meetings unclear you re doing unclear
1	are you gonna do that thing first do you have to do that first
1	what thing pause dur short what
1	the taping thing
1	no
1	oh
1	well no we just tape it
1	oh right
1	we just tape yeah just tape the conversation
1	oh okay pause dur short don t oh right so this is the trunc pl trunc trunc u trunc the business plan for this right okay go on go done
1	yes
1	i m alright i can do it i can work that one out yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh and then erm no cos er you just have an ordinary conversation that s what they want
1	yeah yeah that s fine
1	ordinary conversation pause dur short erm so erm pause dur short the sessions in january pause dur short but also the bit that s troubling me as well is this thing about the location of the new hospice unclear in anon type place unclear
1	yeah
1	and er you said something about a rationale for choosing a particular area
1	i did so we ll talk about that
1	and then erm but then i said in my interview pause dur short that we should do we could kind of talk to the other local health providers and
1	yeah yeah
1	health commissioners to see pause dur short erm pause dur short so that it gets positioned in a in a place where
1	yeah
1	it kind of fits in logically with pause dur short the other services that are available there
1	yeah
1	so pause dur short i want i need to understand from you what your thinking was about location cos you suggested a specific place
1	i did pause dur short i think erm talking about the business pause dur short plan then
1	mm
1	i think we ll always say for the cottage hospice business case
1	mm mm
1	because not enough people in the organisation pause dur short understand the business plan despite trying to consult on it endlessly
1	mm mm
1	and and the document itself unclear as unclear the second time we ve had a business plan three year business plan
1	mm mm
1	not enough staff know the business plan well enough pause dur short trunc r trunc really the managers are getting better at it but to see trunc w trunc what you know the the direction of travel for the next three years which really i think is for the next five in the business plan
1	mm
1	so if we unclear only unclear say business case pause dur short when we re talking about the cottage hospices
1	mm mm
1	i think that unclear will unclear drop into there
1	oh right
1	yeah so
1	okay so
1	to avoid them talking about the business plan for the cottage hospices cos they ll get mixed up unclear between unclear
1	okay
1	business plan that right so in respect of the business case which is what we d said in that thing about the business case for cottage hospices
1	mm mm
1	erm in fact my fixation on language cos i wrote a few times didn t i a full and fully costed kind of business case
1	yes that was scary
1	er it was quite vocal desc laugh so erm pause dur short unclear see what unclear the business case yes and one of the big issues will be location without a doubt
1	mm mm
1	and pause dur short also pause dur short testing it the first one cos the intention is to open one
1	mm mm
1	and see how it goes and run it for a while
1	mm mm
1	and learn the lessons from it before we try to go for a second one but i think there will be a second one
1	okay
1	er but we won t know that until we ve had the first one for a while and there may be a third one but we won t know about that until we ve had the second one for a while
1	okay
1	so the business case erm a big part of it will be location i don t think there s any doubt about that and my
1	mm mm
1	rationale in suggesting that it should be
1	mm
1	i think i said anon type place but i really meant anon type place
1	mm mm
1	because pause dur short i ve thought since i got here that the changes in the nhs and the statutory set up of the nhs pause dur short erm puts pause dur short the patients carers and family that live in the anon type place part of the patch that we cover it leaves them vulnerable
1	mm mm
1	to a shift which means that gps and others might not want to refer to hospice in anon type place
1	oh i see right
1	but trunc m trunc eighty percent of our patients carers and families come from sorry i should ve unclear used some unclear
1	no that s fine
1	eighty percent vocal desc laugh of our patients pause dur short carers and families come from anon type place and twenty percent from anon type place and trunc s trunc and so and that and the funding has always been the same way here traditionally
1	oh right
1	unclear of the unclear eighty percent of the statutory funding comes for anon type place and actually as it happens when i first got here pause dur short people trunc th trunc we didn t know what percentage was but the more the more you cut it vocal desc laugh nearly always finds out it s twenty percent of the patients twenty percent of the carers and families for trunc s trunc for counselling pause dur short twenty percent of the funding from the community vocal desc laugh about works out too because i worried that
1	right gosh
1	we were kind of cross subsidising if you see what i mean
1	yeah
1	we were raising our money in anon type place and spending it in anon type place but we got everything seems to work to twenty percent
1	yeah pause dur short that s quite interesting
1	and so erm i worry that the maps you know maps in my humble opinion are just lines drawn on a piece of paper
1	yeah
1	they re arbitrary
1	yeah
1	erm trunc s trunc but people still see us cos we re based in anon type place and anon type place pause dur short people see the organisation as being about anon type place and anon type place despite
1	yeah
1	the fact that the vast majority of people we see we see in their homes they can see us around this building
1	yeah
1	and so that s why i ve thought since i got here that we should do something and put a bricks and mortar facility in anon type place because the truth of those maps is that you know better than i all of this pause dur short where people live is just where people live it s really about work trunc u trunc er trunc u trunc home to work routes home to shopping home to facilities home to services and people in anon type place and surrounding area see themselves attached to anon type place and attached to kind of this part of anon type place
1	cos they come here
1	because they come here cos they go shopping to anon type place
1	yeah and there s an easy road
1	erm
1	or an easy route
1	exactly and and also then the trunc n trunc if you start fine graining that
1	yeah
1	and you start getting into so this this is er an older erm erm map about and we re not on it if you see what i mean this is
1	no i ve been looking for you mm
1	yeah where where where where my little pencil we can we can find these again but if you see my little pencil mark is where we cover in the anon type place bit
1	yeah
1	and this just happens to be the commissioning groups within trunc nas trunc nhs anon type place anon type place is a complicated area in the sense that as as you know anon type place county council is kind of easy and covers all of anon type place anon type place has two county councils
1	mm
1	west and east
1	yeah
1	and so i m only interested i personally am only interested in in east pause dur short and the introduction of the clinical commissioning groups
1	mm mm
1	and the loss of a strategic health authority and therefore a strategic picture and the government push to localism whatever that means pause dur short means that anon type place particularly and these clinical commissioning groups within anon type place
1	mm
1	i i i i i know i go off at tangents actually that one of the things about the
1	mm
1	about the routes that where people live and where they see themselves belonging to you know the committee development stuff that you know this village or this community ends at that river or that scout hut if you re the other side of the scout hut then you re not part of blah you trunc kn trunc and so pause dur short this part of anon type place hasn t got a big pause dur short secondary healthcare acute trust hospital and so that s another reason that people from anon type place and anon type place and further down to anon type place come to anon type place cos there s this massive pfi hospital pause dur short anon type place which is
1	right
1	used to be
1	mm
1	the anon type place and anon type place in the centre of anon type place that s been bulldozed and they re building houses pause dur short but the pfi hospital is anon type place anon type place so they see themselves belonging to this as part of the health economy too
1	oh i see
1	and i just trunc w trunc er and because there s no pause dur short acute pause dur short big hospital for the trunc s trunc anon type place pause dur short anon type place ccgs
1	mm
1	then some of their political small piece strategy is to run their health economy by limiting the amount of people that are referred to an acute trust cos they ve got three hospice hospitals sorry three cottage hospitals and the gps would like not to send people to hospital
1	right
1	because it costs them a lot of money so they re trying to run their health economy based on the three cottage hospitals which which will have flaws and problems for the people that live there and so i want to make sure that we as the hospice have some presence there cos i
1	mm
1	worry that one that of the trunc unti trunc unintended consequences of all of these shifts would mean that people that live there that traditionally have always come to this hospice trunc u trunc to visit people or supported us with money and feel they belong to anon type place and anon type place pause dur short will be told by their gp they can t be referred here so that s my logic
1	mm
1	about why in the main i think we should try the first cottage hospice in anon type place
1	yes and
1	it s interesting that i can t really have that conversation meaningfully
1	trunc ha trunc
1	with the trustees pause dur short or or trunc th trunc even my my fellow hospice leadership team trunc m trunc erm members really because it trunc g trunc it gets it it some of is guess work on my part about strategy having seen many times before vocal desc laugh these kind of restructurings in statutory services
1	yeah
1	end up with unintended consequences
1	yes
1	sorry i stopped you you were gonna say something
1	no no no no that s fine erm pause dur short so trunc a trunc sorry how many ccgs in anon type place one two three four event desc sound of tapping on table
1	er in anon type place yes yeah there s a yeah
1	okay
1	so this is the whole of anon type place and by and large that s the ones for anon type place yeah
1	okay
1	and the one that we cover most is this anon type place anon type place and anon type place
1	yes
1	and here is the population of of the erm the the ccgs which with trunc u trunc trunc p trunc trunc p trunc politics with a big p on i mean there is some argument trunc i trunc erm bear in mind this only came out trunc rec trunc the ccgs have only come out in the last four years
1	yes
1	er the health and social care bill
1	yes
1	and there is an argument some people think that they re gonna end up merging cos they think some of these populations are no big enough to get the economies of scale that
1	mm
1	that the ccgs need
1	yes
1	and when i think this this one anon type place district trunc i trunc so it s really these three actually that make up anon type place
1	yeah pause dur short well anon type place look at anon type place anon type place s huge
1	it is but it s a unitary as well so actually
1	yeah so it ll it ll yeah they ll declare unclear anon type place unclear it ll be a trunc t trunc it ll be private company unclear anon type place unclear unclear eventually unclear
1	unclear well it s interesting cos you you like these kind of things i m not sure and and i trunc s trunc think i probably do too i m not sure that the hospice is kinda bit removed in a third sector sense that it floats like an island hospices they re outside the you know they re in the sector but outside the sector
1	mm
1	these three ccgs for anon type place yeah so anon type place pause dur short anon type place and anon type place anon type place a rather erm coast pause dur short trunc c trunc is that what it s called a coastal community healthcare that s helpful erm
1	mm
1	are doing lots of things together so they have one joint newsletter
1	oh pause dur short right
1	and erm and they they and the the economies of the economies of scale for ccgs one of the really main players that s invisible pause dur short unless you re immersed in this stuff are the commissioning support units
1	right
1	and there s a big paper about commissioning support units that s come out of government commissioning support units are supposed to make the economies of scale so these ccgs aren t big enough to commission
1	no oh
1	and so the trunc cc trunc the commissioning support units are pulling them together pause dur short find the economies of scale
1	er
1	and so really that s another restructuring by the back door which is putting pcts and strategic vocal desc laugh authorities back in unclear and finding unclear things but if you read the guidance out of government they are to build the market that s their job is to build the marketplace this is privatisation of the nhs through the back door erm but but also some of the biggest threats around that pause dur short are the old the nhs structures themselves
1	right
1	so erm
1	so these the faceless bureaucrats will be back
1	they are still there and they ve not really left so the chief exec of the commissioning support unit for what was anon type place and anon type place
1	mm
1	which now covers all of this cos it s now anon type place and anon type place and
1	oh does it
1	anon type place and something else
1	promotion
1	are the same people that went through the revolving door and took their two hundred and fifty thousand pounds redundancy and have popped up again as the chief exec of whatever and as they try separate off commissioning also the deliverers are the same in the sense that if we take the anon type place bit here which i haven t isn t in here but it s my pencil line anon type place pct
1	mm mm
1	the chief exec anon nametype f type name took her money for redundancy from being the anon type place pct chief exec and became the anon type place and anon type place community health trust chief exec which is a delivery nhs organisation and and they are looking to deliver well beyond anon type place and anon type place so for example
1	mm mm
1	my choice of cottage hospice again this is all about my choice of cottage hospice being in anon type place pause dur short the anon type place anon type place and anon type place erm ccg has broken ranks with the other two on the issue of community services
1	oh right
1	and has pushed out its thirteen million pounds community contract to any bidder so virgin healthcare could bid and be delivering that in anon type place another unclear good result unclear my cottage hospice there but also anon type place and anon type place community health trust have bid are bidding to do it
1	mm mm
1	and what was anon type place
1	vocal desc gasp oh
1	anon type place healthcare community health trust has also bid unclear into there unclear
1	oh really
1	so the internal market for the nhs as well as the external market makes a really uncertain time
1	wow pause dur short wow
1	hence me wanting my cottage hospice here for the future for the people that live there
1	yes yes pause dur short yes and also being the one the one identifiable unit pause dur short er unclear delivery vocal desc laugh that you might actually might give us some money to
1	yes and and particularly because that contracts out
1	yeah
1	and people are bidding in and they won t let the contract till next october by which time i m hoping to have broken ground and say to the new provider by the way chaps we have this new cottage hospice just opening
1	yeah and is it now trunc we trunc do they not trunc ha trunc do they have to have their community involvement section in their business case in their business case for their bid
1	in the pause dur short they will have to have their community we er trunc n trunc now your next the next level of complexity then
1	mm
1	yeah
1	so if i was to erm i can draw on this you can have this map if trunc i trunc trunc i trunc it s interesting that there are possibly if i take this patch here and i said
1	yeah
1	they they re putting out trunc the trunc they re putting out the yellow are putting out their community service thirteen million pounds
1	mm
1	arguably there are six hospices which have a bit of service into that community thing
1	right
1	so we ve tried to talk as hospices
1	are you that scribble
1	yeah we re that scribble
1	okay
1	erm anon type place and anon type place here
1	mm mm
1	anon type place anon type place erm anon type place anon type place they all do a bit they think of
1	yeah
1	that kind of service
1	yeah
1	and get money six six hospices from that ccg anon type place and anon type place tiny bits of money relatively i think we get about seventy two thousand pounds
1	mm
1	but they all get unclear big trunc s trunc unclear and so the hospices then in this brave new world have been talking about pulling together a consortium to speak to the new bidders and providers and to be part of their community planning for their bid
1	oh right
1	but the truth is that this is brand new to us as hospices they don t i believe they don t understand what consortium means actually this is back to srb or or or lottery or you know trunc a trunc we as hospices don t know what consortium means and they all think that we can be a trunc com trunc become a consortium
1	mm
1	and we can all have a seat at that big table they don t realise that that consortium will mean subcontracting effectively
1	mm
1	but they have found out that the money that s given to hospices three hundred and eighty five thousand pounds is not part of the thirteen million pounds so they think everything s okay now but the truth is we have to work with that provider because that is the provider that will refer into hospice services so
1	yeah
1	actually i have had some negotiations with anon type place and anon type place are bidding in we are also on the face of it part of this consortium of six because they don t know what s gonna happen so they re all looking to consult and see what happens but er
1	yeah
1	the current provider is called anon type place anon type place community health trust who has been appalling for ever and so that s why this ccg are getting rid of them
1	right
1	so all of this means this is the place to go i have no doubt that if we re gonna open a cottage hospice this is the place to go
1	right
1	it has no acute trust hospital it is fed by cottage hospitals
1	ah
1	and actually it is the place this is the most dangerous for us strategically of losing if something happens
1	mm mm
1	and therefore the patients themselves would struggle and lose out
1	mm mm
1	er and cos it s just new maps and new trunc di trunc new lines this unclear them on unclear the ccg maps didn t exist before so they re new maps and new lines and therefore that s why i think that s where we should go first
1	okay
1	i have floated that idea with the ccg at our meeting who thought it was very interesting and would like to speak more
1	say that last bit again what you floated
1	i have floated the idea of our cottage hospice idea with this ccg
1	mm pause dur short right
1	and they re very interested in it and would like to know more the thing is i need to get past the gatekeepers the decision makers
1	yeah
1	but it kind of makes sense to them because it makes sense to them cos they re trying to run a health economy with just cottage hospitals
1	yeah
1	so the cottage hospice concept fits into their construct of what they see
1	yeah
1	as secondary care
1	right pause dur short uhu
1	there s another level of there about why to have it there cos what i don t want to happen is the cottage hospitals to go for palliative care in a big way cos they would be a major threat to us pause dur short because they would be potentially a provider if there s money comes and they get another level of complexity pause dur short nationally a couple of years ago there was a palliative care funding review pause dur short which was led by tom hughes hallett who s the chief exec of marie curie
1	mm
1	and they what they re trying to do with the palliative care funding review is find a per patient tariff for the government
1	ah right
1	to say what should the state do for palliative care patients
1	right
1	and how do we fund that so for three or four years they ve been trying to pull together this palliative care funding review they had massive consultations they produced various documents they had a final document government were committed to it at the time that s the coalition they did eleven pilot sites to try and work out how the tariff and the currency would work
1	mm mm
1	they ve trunc subsequent trunc pushed out another report a few weeks ago which is their final version which to me looks like fudge smells like fudge and tastes like fudge there will be no i don t think the well the the final document is clear there will be there s another set of pilots to do but it s clear that there would be no more money and and it will not be a statutory requirement however pause dur short if that tariff can be erm an agreement which is voluntary and this ccg decides to follow that agreement and the cottage hospices take that money then that will affect hospices and others and so the palliative care funding review is more of a danger to hospices than it is a benefit pause dur short because if acute trusts can get money out of it then they will take money and make money out of it because another level of complexity in getting your head back into the nhs system is pause dur short although there is no pause dur short secondary healthcare acute trust in this ccg are cos it s at anon type place
1	mm
1	yeah pause dur short what s happening in the changes in the health economy is foundation status for hospitals
1	yeah
1	as they get foundation status it gives
1	yeah
1	them far more freedom to behave like a private sector hospital
1	yeah
1	which is another reason that this ccg doesn t want them as part of their picture cos they re going to charge more money and do things
1	right
1	and they could also do by opening palliative care wards if there s money in it they would take that money which d be another threat to the million pound statutory funding that we do that
1	trunc r trunc oh right pause dur long so but because there isn t a hospital that would have foundation status here there s less of a risk of that in this unclear area unclear
1	it s just over the boundary
1	mm
1	so trunc th trunc there s still a risk to us
1	mm
1	erm about the foundation status thing but that s in kent and it s less of a risk i think than here but it is one of the reasons that this ccg is going for a very community based approach
1	right
1	in what it wants to do that s why it s gonna commission community services thirteen million pounds and part of that contract makes them use the cottage hospitals that are in that patch
1	mm
1	but what i wouldn t want to happen is if those cottage hospitals started effectively becoming mini hospices pause dur short and and opening a ward that s that s just for palliative care patients cos lots of cottage hospitals pause dur short are under utilised and looking for a role and i
1	yeah
1	don t want them to find the role of our palliative care and de facto hospices
1	yeah
1	they re also they re not very good at it usually
1	well trunc prob trunc well that s like trying to get a lawyer to be a mediator they don t
1	yeah
1	they don t do it
1	yeah
1	don t er that s not the skills they have so erm
1	but that won t stop the ccg trying to get them to do it if the palliative care funding review makes a revenue income string for them
1	well they re going to chase the money aren t they
1	they re going to chase the money absolutely
1	like everybody does
1	and the foundation trust might also chase the money but they re less likely to change the money because they
1	yeah
1	chase the money cos they ve got such a massive area to cover
1	yeah
1	and if you want to go further with some of this if we if i go back to the kent bit of it
1	yeah
1	so this anon type place hospital which is really the anon type place and anon type place trust
1	mm mm
1	cos it s both actually it s anon type place and anon type place trust
1	mm mm
1	and so they have two hospital sites one at anon type place and one at anon type place
1	mm mm
1	which is another reason that i m okay within that patch really it s another reason i don t need to open the first one here i need the second one to be here i think because we re we get most of eighty percent of our patients eighty percent of our money and we understand pause dur short this system this health economic system better pause dur short but in the longer term if i wound on ten years it will change maybe five because in anon type place there s a brand new hospital called the institute the anon type place institute of something something pause dur short brand new massive private hospital has been built speculatively for the changes in in health and i know from the anon type place ccg chief exec that this institute it s called the anon type place and something institute you ll find it on the website is demanding that when they push out the contract which is currently to pause dur short anon type place hospital as it always has been they want the chance to bid into it so it s gonna get competitive about acute trusts and secondary care here
1	oh god who s building it
1	it s been built and i don t know who s built it i think it might be er er er i don t know who the private hospital is but it s brand new pause dur short purpose built pause dur short and it can t possibly be big enough yet but it is a private sector hospital
1	mm so somebody s got pause dur short billion pounds to
1	yes throw the money at
1	trunc spec trunc speculate unclear on it unclear
1	yes yes pause dur short erm trunc u trunc based around interestingly you know anon type place anon type place and anon type place pause dur short so this pfi will need foundation status but it is gonna have to compete with this stuff here so we will come to that later erm that s fine
1	mm
1	if there s those levels of complexity and there s another level of complexity if i talk about the five to ten years thing and if i think beyond ten years i think that pause dur short county councils pause dur short will become the main stakeholder for hospices not the nhs
1	right
1	the merging of health and social care will have to happen
1	yes yeah
1	and actually it won t be the health economy and the acute trusts and the cottage hospitals that will be our main worry partner whatever it will be county councils
1	mm
1	because the health and social care and the dilnot report and everything will have to be addressed by vocal desc laugh somebody at some time
1	yeah
1	so the demographic is more elderly frail people and so that means they get more cancers and trunc s trunc and so so there is a pause dur short there s another moral imperative
1	mm
1	for elderly frail people and i think that the partner in that will be county councils
1	mm
1	not not the nhs as we know it and therefore health and well being boards if they continue depending who gets in when the government changes pause dur short in in in a in a time horizon of five ten years beyond ten trunc y trunc it will be them not the nhs
1	yeah well no they ve got to it s it does it s ludicrous
1	yeah pause dur short so
1	okay so and erm
1	mm
1	as far as that s concerned this picture you re painting here
1	yeah
1	you re you re confident enough enough enough about it to trunc s trunc to put your shirt on this because your man here
1	yeah
1	he backed a pause dur short an idea that didn t work and
1	the trunc me trunc the unclear markets unclear thing back in about care you mean
1	yeah pause dur short so but so but you re confident enough that this is you know your hunch your hunch or your or your strategic thinking about all this is
1	hunch yeah yeah
1	is right
1	i ve thought since i got here that cos that was the cusp of the act the health and social care act pause dur short that pause dur short the people at anon type place the people in anon type place that we serve and it goes further down cos you get you then get into these kind of you know these these anon type place anon type place it s about where the gps are in here
1	mm mm
1	it s this part of this patch
1	yeah
1	that this has always been a danger for us because it could pause dur short relatively at the stroke of a pen the ccg could say to all their gps you don t refer to people over the trunc bou trunc over the border in anon type place
1	right
1	and and therefore they could do that at trunc an trunc at any unclear rate unclear
1	yeah and actually some are already doing that aren t they so that
1	yeah
1	where is it where they ve already said no you can t have choice any more
1	yes
1	where you go
1	and so my worry is trunc w trunc we ll lose patient choice
1	yes
1	and if you stop the referral routes by gps then we then people wouldn t get wouldn t get referred into this hospice trunc defi trunc despite the fact they ve supported the hospice for twenty years
1	i always thought that people self referrals to hospices
1	we ve we ve only just introduced self referral
1	really
1	we we
1	i thought i thought you elected to
1	no
1	i thought you sort you said oh well you know i d like to go to the hospice please and they said yes fine
1	well that would
1	and off you trotted
1	that would be good if that s the case pause dur short unclear generally unclear
1	trunc doc trunc doctors
1	trunc g trunc gps gps gps are the main referrer
1	uhu
1	we re trying to break that cycle and we ve been trying for a while to break that cycle and we will take self referrals in fact in the last few months we ve put a self referral button on the website and we ll take phone self referral but in some respects that s a con because they re not self referrals because we still then have to go back to the vocal desc laugh gp and negotiate and say
1	right
1	mrs smith would like to be referred here can we have a conversation about this please so we have our unclear
1	so the gps have to consent
1	they have to have the consent and mainly main referrals come from gps cos that conversation should be had with gps
1	mm
1	there s part of the trunc th trunc stuff that drives the strategy for us is that pause dur short it s a great piece of research which is pretty conclusive and people have bought into that says pause dur short cos you can t buck these numbers you see at any one time one percent of a gps patient population is in the last year of their life
1	mm
1	fact pause dur short some of that is sudden deaths and heart attacks and car accidents however there s some good research that says pause dur short in western democracies you know developed countries that s trunc u trunc between sixty four i think sixty four and eighty one percent of those people in the last year of life should be trunc s trunc should have palliative care needs addressed
1	mm
1	so we know that one percent of our population pause dur short three hundred and sixty thousand is in last year of life so we could see three thousand six hundred people a year
1	mm
1	we know we don t need to see all of them but we do know that actually between sixty odd percent and eighty percent let s say yeah we should be seeing and we re not seeing that so our big quest of of our business plan is to have a forty five percent increase so at the currently we see about eleven hundred new referrals each and every year and we intend by the end of the business plan period be seeing sixteen hundred new referrals each and every year which is another reason to build some bed capacity in
1	mm
1	which is stepdown bed stuff so it does fit
1	yeah
1	together my unclear hunch unclear and my shirt and my
1	yeah
1	my things so
1	yeah
1	i m pretty confident that that would be the first place to go
1	okay pause dur short and then so then
1	it s it s a complex picture and argument to make isn t it
1	it is unclear
1	to the uninitiated
1	it is rather pause dur short yes cos you could go if but er
1	yeah yeah
1	oh yes mm so so the sort of area you re looking at is sort of anon type place anon type place anon type place that sort of the top half of there
1	yes
1	the top half of that
1	yes pause dur short we have a shop in anon type place where we ve had for many many years we have a shop in anon type place which we ve had for not that quite that long
1	oh right pause dur short aha
1	er and we serve these gp practices up here by and large
1	yeah
1	and we will certainly need to get the figures from the gp practices cos it s gp practices which erm pause dur short which govern it all but as you can see there are because they re rural communities there are not a lot of gp practices to trunc s trunc for the population they cover and serve so they re very spread out
1	mm mm
1	cos erm it we ll get the same thing if this map showed anon type place and things you know the anon type place gp surgery does a lot of referrals to us which is trunc t trunc possibly a unclear historical appointment unclear kind of thing
1	oh right anon type place like yes
1	and so when you get if you took if that was anon type place then if that was that anon type place and we re quite you know we get a lot of referrals and good
1	mm
1	relationship with anon type place pause dur short some people that go to anon type place vocal desc laugh live there
1	yeah i know i was unclear thinking unclear
1	vocal desc laugh so so this becomes you know you could write a business case based around the reality of
1	yeah
1	unclear this unclear what happens for pause dur short home to work routes home to shop routes home to gp routes home to hospice routes blah trunc b trunc home to hospital routes blah blah blah
1	yeah
1	etcetera etcetera so i i m pretty confident that that s the big strategic solution we need to solve
1	yeah
1	because of the worries of unintended consequences of changes
1	yeah well it s already the case in london pause dur short i think you know with if you go to a gp surgery unclear but you re over the line
1	yeah yeah
1	next door
1	yeah and trunc al trunc
1	we you didn t didn t use to have
1	ultimately we think we should be about patient choice if they want to come to us and be under our care then that should be their prerogative really
1	yeah no absolutely
1	unclear because we can service that care unclear
1	no well that s what people expect as well
1	mm
1	okay so and your name is known round there as well already so you ve trunc alr trunc you ve already got a presence of
1	yeah yeah i
1	shops and things like that
1	i think that erm the trunc f trunc the further you get away from erm anon type place
1	yeah
1	the further down you get past anon type place although we ve got a shop in anon type place anon type place have also got a shop in anon type place pause dur short anon type place is probably here then
1	oh right
1	vocal desc laugh
1	oh yeah
1	erm actually anon type place the anon type place anon type place has got a shop in anon type place pause dur short and they re they re they re there
1	vocal desc laugh naughty thing get back over the boundary
1	and so this becomes a disputed area of er for
1	yes vocal desc laugh
1	unclear kind of unclear where you go
1	okay
1	because arguably you know we re about the same distance vocal desc laugh
1	yes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	yes er er
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and then you said trunc w trunc you will need figures from the gp practices pause dur short figures of
1	well if we re yeah
1	how many of them how what percentage of them unclear there s hints unclear you think are going to be
1	you see we yeah unclear it s hindered you see unclear cos cos i know that the that the pause dur short that the pause dur short the anon type place practice there and the anon type place practice refer to us but i suspect that if the gp practice for anon type place is here i wouldn t be surprised if they do refer to there
1	mm
1	because hospices have been trunc b trunc have grown up around a building and the truth is that we re not about a building we ve probably got far more of our nurses in hospice in the home trunc g trunc active here
1	oh right yeah
1	than they ve got anything so buildings are just buildings so you
1	yeah
1	you put another layer of complexity trunc i trunc is that we ve got for hospice in the home in a really big way
1	yes
1	compared to other hospices pause dur short because the research suggests that that s what people want pause dur short so that research we said about demos you know the number of people that want to die at home
1	yes pause dur short yeah
1	then we ve tried to meet that by putting hospice in the home so effectively our hospice in the home is like i ve got a five hundred bed virtual ward
1	yes
1	vocal desc laugh all over the place and a significant bit of it is here
1	but also that it s that that feels like the easier argument to make to people pause dur short that actually if a lot of your nurses and a lot of your patients are round here pause dur short then there will be quite a big proportion of them who get to the point where they can t be looked at
1	yeah
1	and we re therefore having somewhere
1	absolutely
1	number one where you can bring their relatives for training and support
1	trunc a trunc absolutely
1	and counselling and whatever pause dur short and number two that if things get too tough at home you can say well actually just pop up the road
1	yes
1	into this unit
1	i trunc s trunc i i would have to look at the figures on this when you say about putting my shirt on it i also pretty confident that if you took the population of nursing homes event desc sound of tapping on table
1	yeah
1	here
1	yeah
1	and took them here event desc sound of tapping on table this is less so again
1	oh right okay
1	there aren t enough of them i i suspect
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	er trunc c trunc because it s about if you want to run a care home do it in a big trunc bir trunc urban area vocal desc laugh you know run it in birmingham
1	mm
1	vocal desc laugh you know and trunc s trunc so
1	yeah
1	and so they become so it s a scarcity a supply and demand kinda model
1	yeah
1	and so although i m not trying to open a nursing home it is the cottage hospice idea is not the same as a satellite of here i do not want patients with complexity here we ve got consultants here we ve got very specialist doctors we ve got very very pause dur short that s not the people i m thinking i m putting in a cottage hospice it s stepdown care really pause dur short but but the makes sense about the logic that they would rather go unclear kind of thing unclear
1	but it trunc make trunc but it makes senses that the nurses who do go pause dur short hospice in the home pause dur short are more
1	yes
1	the staff that you want in this one pause dur short in in a cottage hospice
1	i think when we come to the staffing of it i think that it s existing staff that we can utilise who want to do it absolutely yeah
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	but also the cottage hospice idea is pause dur short they can call in vocal desc laugh they re still the same patients so if they if they re out and active and they re here pause dur short you know the the the the trunc s trunc clinical nurse specialists and the staff nurses and the healthcare assistants that serve this are pause dur short if mrs smith and they visit her in her home here pause dur short a lot and they know here anyway pause dur short and she needs to come in pause dur short trunc b trunc because actually she can t cope at home cos whatever her husband can t cope trunc sh trunc often a carer failure that means they can t cope
1	yeah i know i know
1	it s not a patient failure it s a carer failure
1	no well cos they just can t they can t just can t do it
1	yeah
1	you can understand why they can t do it and actually the
1	yeah
1	the trunc n trunc not just demos report but the other reports done by that help the hospices thing pause dur short trunc y trunc you know one of the one of the chief barriers was because the carers just think oh shit vocal desc laugh
1	yes pause dur short yeah
1	yeah
1	vocal desc sigh
1	can t do it
1	can t do it pause dur short don t want to do it
1	no
1	so
1	well not don t want to but just think i i i can t how can i how could i what can i i don t want to watch it i don t wanna be there i can t do this i can t do that
1	yeah yeah pause dur short so erm what was i going to say and sometimes actually it was interesting it s monday today on friday one of trunc h trunc our crisises on friday was is we were on the run up to christmas that pause dur short we needed the nhs to put five hospital beds in various places trunc w trunc been been supposed to have done it all week and their system had fallen down as it often does nhs do not put in pause dur short the the trunc s trunc the things they should put in lifts blah blah blah blah blah beds pause dur short erm and so we needed five beds in arjo beds pause dur short and then the contract
1	arjo
1	er it s a big unclear manufacturer of beds
1	oh right okay
1	r r a r j o pause dur short er but the nhs hadn t got them and they subcontract to arjo direct and their engineer was off sick so they hadn t put in these five beds
1	gosh
1	one of the patients died on the thursday so it s four beds then cos they need to go in when they need to go in
1	mm
1	erm and at at six o clock on friday we trunc st trunc i still hadn t sorted it out er by getting them in pause dur short erm pause dur short and so if that kinda thing happened we gotta unclear should actually put unclear put them into there
1	mm
1	i could put them in pause dur short er i could i could bring them so that there wouldn t be that crisis at home pause dur short and sometimes the nhs is just pause dur short so poor that it makes people then they re in trunc s trunc they re in chairs or they go to john lewis and buy a bed it s not a hospital bed pause dur short it doesn t help it doesn t drop down it s not got unclear er things unclear to put up etcetera etcetera
1	no
1	unclear mattresses
1	so it would just be another way that we could even if it wasn t permanent they could be in and in for a while and back out again
1	yes
1	whereas coming here we are
1	yeah and that weekend holiday thing
1	yeah yeah
1	which of course is also the big
1	yeah
1	the big thing
1	mm
1	where pause dur short erm they the hospitals want you gone before the bank holiday monday
1	yes
1	and the relatives think please don t send them home vocal desc laugh
1	so i think it s the logical place to put it s where we re weakest and less known
1	okay
1	it s where the changes are happening er in a big way that s changing the model
1	yeah
1	er in the nhs kinda set up erm healthcare set up pause dur short er there s a new provider coming in to do the community stuff so it s a it s you know that we we d be there by the time they kinda came in pause dur short erm i i er in back to that consortium i really unclear did unclear jump all over the place the six hospices that serve this area we re serving poorly i think with the six of us and it could be like an end of life care facilitator pause dur short i could get i could facilitate unclear better really unclear for trunc o trunc to the other hospices actually
1	mm mm
1	as part of that whole process
1	right
1	although they i suspect they won t like it pause dur short that the the hospices will not like me putting a cottage hospices and they ll probably see it as
1	no they probably won t
1	no they vocal desc laugh i m pretty confident they won t
1	yeah i know that s a tank
1	they ll see it as competition
1	being put on their lawn yeah
1	actually but whenever i ve had discussions with them pause dur short and they trunc c trunc want to talk about collaboration because pause dur short help the hospices is saying that there should be collaboration pause dur short i think in reality there should be mergers and acquisitions actually
1	mm
1	and although they talk collaboration whenever they talk about it they go i don t know what you mean if we can have a shared understanding of this that would be great but if we can t have a shared understanding whenever you say collaboration i m gonna say and competition because actually vocal desc laugh sometimes we re gonna have to compete
1	mm pause dur short yeah no nobody wants but no yeah nobody wants to be the one taking over do they
1	yeah pause dur short yeah unclear i mean unclear
1	but but and how much of this goes in the business case is this all implicit then pause dur short this stuff pause dur short we we take
1	i don t mind
1	we take it as read that that that that decision is kinda made that it s kinda round here
1	i haven t i pause dur short trunc o trunc trunc w trunc trunc w trunc we ve just been speaking for what twenty minutes
1	something like that i think
1	i have articulated this
1	no thirty eight
1	thirty eight there you go cos i ve talked too much and gone off at tangents there
1	no no no no no no no this isn t
1	i trunc ha trunc i no i do i do no no no i have articulated this i think at board meetings over the last four years i ve certainly had quite a lot of discussions pause dur short which may now look to be pause dur short one of the problems with the chairman pause dur short to explain some of the complexities of this
1	yeah
1	and although pause dur short he s interested because he s the chairman pause dur short and he sees parallels cos he s a businessman first and foremost so
1	yeah
1	i think he understood what some of this logic was
1	yeah
1	not sure that i ve told pause dur short enough of it to the trustees to paint the picture
1	yeah
1	but you also need to have some strategic understanding of the statutory things
1	yes
1	and and how the third sector works to appreciate it so pause dur short i i think we can put anything and everything in that business case and i think if we can articulate this in print for people then that would be great
1	yeah
1	erm
1	so it s kind of well there s a sort of future proofing
1	yeah
1	section
1	and i maybe i need to have those conversations more with the hospice leadership team
1	unless you wanna blame me
1	no trunc w trunc trunc w trunc in what way
1	well you often ah well you know this is often the case when you buy when you bring people in to do a business case for you a business plan pause dur short it s often so trunc u trunc trunc l trunc there is a lot of cases where people are punting an idea and they don t know if it s gonna work or not
1	yeah yeah
1	so you get your consultant shot down
1	sure well i ll be alright then pause dur short i m pretty confident
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that this is where we should go but strategy gets complex doesn t it i mean pause dur short you know
1	well no i mean the thing is that these things may or they may not come to pass i mean if there s a revolution and we don t have the same government next time
1	exactly pause dur short yeah yeah
1	but then but then that s if there s other reasons why it it it might go there like there were lots of patients there or there were lots of nurses there there is a lack of a great big hospital there pause dur short you know the the other reasons which are trunc a trunc practicalities then come into play as well so
1	yeah yeah pause dur short see the all the ones that i think that i ve just articulated to you are pause dur short if were you to have mapped them and used some business tools to map what kind of the reality of them is they re all pretty much a reality pause dur short i could go another step about things that pause dur short quite possibly as you said if the revolution comes pause dur short i don t think ever pause dur short erm unclear where to start that unclear i anon type place and anon type place isn t big enough to be a trunc s trunc decent county council pause dur short vocal desc laugh i don t i don t think it ever has been
1	mm mm
1	and so anon type place is always a problem for them because
1	mm
1	actually some government ought to come in and make sure there s only one county council pause dur short having said that that ought to be caught up in the fact of two tier authorities do not work
1	no
1	so if i said to you that i think in ten years it will be the county councils that are our main stakeholder relationship person not the nhs
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	then they have to be big enough and so some government s got to come in and actually make them big enough and in doing that they ve got to address two tier authorities which nobody ever has so far
1	no no and then and that s a political hot potato isn t it
1	it s a political hot potato but if they were to merge at some point anon type place and anon type place which is what they ought to do trunc r trunc in reality is anon type place would struggle even more with some of these things so if trunc w trunc wind on ten years and think pause dur short it s the county councils then that s another reason to be down here and make sure that you are there actually
1	that s huge though isn t it
1	it is it it is huge but you need economies of scale don t you
1	oh that s massive i mean pause dur short how can you pause dur short well yeah but you know that s geographically enormous isn t it is that that would be bigger than any other local authority i mean i suppose it s when you say they re too small it s cos of the population
1	it s the rural population that s diverse and
1	yeah
1	and and and scattered as well
1	yeah
1	but anon type place anon type place makes it worse but actually in that revolution kinda thing the more likely the more blue sky thinking kinda stuff is pause dur short the county councils have also got to get out of delivery cos too many of them have been delivering about social care
1	mm
1	and they don t do it cost effectively and they don t do it efficiently and they trunc d trunc so they ve gotta get out of that which means being bigger and changing completely because actually they re the commissioners they re contract managers of stuff
1	yes pause dur short yeah
1	and but that more blue sky and it s more further on it s not something
1	yeah although that no plenty more opportunity for the private sector there
1	yeah which i think is what s gonna happen the truth is like the trunc h trunc health is really i wouldn t be surprised to see virgin healthcare trunc deliv trunc look bid for that bid
1	yeah
1	they do it in anon type place
1	with a thousand a thousand carers over the whole of anon type place of anon type place
1	yeah yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short so that but that s probably not it s not easy to write that one in cos then people go but but but but the stuff we ve spoken about so far is easy enough to write into the bid to go this is why we re going down into pause dur short into this ccg as our first cottage hospice
1	mm
1	with the intention of doing something again on the edges of our patch later pause dur short there s also just you know a a a a unclear this has become a unclear trunc bain trunc brain dump now really pause dur short we ve already made the move away from being a building cos i constantly say yeah hospices aren t about a building they re about a philosophy of care
1	right
1	and we all do that as hospices then we show pictures of buildings to trunc reass trunc vocal desc laugh to reaffirm that we re about buildings pause dur short erm pause dur short but we re not and trunc a trunc also the hospice in the home has moved us away from being about buildings but in public perception we re still about buildings
1	mm
1	and my fellow chief execs of hospices
1	trunc ex trunc ah well then perhaps this is where macmillan has got the pause dur short the rush on the hospices because it s they re about lovely ladies
1	they are indeed and don t don t have to have a building i agree
1	no
1	so i think you need both though
1	so yeah
1	cos you do need to be able to bring people in that s why i said in anon type place
1	mm
1	virgin healthcare deliver everything that we deliver except the inpatient unit and the reason they don t want to do that is cos it s expensive you can t make money out of it pause dur short it s not cost effective pause dur short so you do always need a building i believe
1	and who is gonna give money to virgin pause dur short actually
1	well yes vocal desc laugh
1	i mean
1	so i think you need a building but it s
1	yes
1	it s unclear just a lot about unclear building but having said that my fellow it s interesting there are two anon type place s there s the anon type place there where s anon type place on here then that
1	it s a little funny lump
1	oh it s here sorry that s that s here right down here
1	mm mm
1	it s interesting that anon type place s got a anon type place as well so anon type place at anon type place there s a anon type place at anon type place
1	are they different pause dur short anon type place different
1	yes totally different they re all independent
1	but the same anon type place originally probably
1	yes
1	but
1	but they yeah i m sure they were this is interesting that they have just outgrown their building which is quite a nice building but they ve decided then they re gonna close and sell off that building and building and build a brand new building pause dur short so they re all sticking to buildings and we re not doing buildings despite coming to unclear a unclear cottage hospice we re coming to cottage hospice because we ve grown hospice in the home to such an extent pause dur short that it s an increase in beds in a stepdown way i think it i m confident it fits into a bigger model jigsaw model really pause dur short er but that s not what most people are doing they re sticking to buildings this anon type place
1	mm
1	moved out of a perfectly serviceable but old building to a brand new offsite pause dur short architect design winning kind of thing they re still sticking to buildings
1	mm
1	they re they re not going in to hospice in the home kind of territory pause dur short anon type place and anon type place
1	but that s a funding strategy isn t it pause dur short you can always you know in a way
1	get raise the money for it
1	you re doing building works you can always get money for building works
1	yeah yeah pause dur short yeah
1	as long as you don t go bust doing it but yeah
1	anon type place and anon type place our nearest neighbour here that covers and would see itself as covering most of this this ccg
1	yeah
1	has i don t think any hospice in the home any community care at all
1	anon type place and anon type place what
1	anon type place and anon type place
1	mm
1	and it s called actually anon type place and anon type place hospice and anon type place
1	mm
1	so it s not even putting itself as a hospice and if you go actually you could go and visit there and should go and visit there actually pause dur short is it s here and pause dur short trunc con trunc continuing care s interesting so if you go to visit them
1	mm
1	they ve just put a lot of money into a building too pause dur short they ve got like half of it is a hospice and the other side of it is continuing care pause dur short so we need to
1	what do they mean trunc con trunc what sorry what is continuing care
1	yes well i there s a separate paper if i haven t sent you that paper i need to send you that paper about nhs continuing care
1	right
1	because one of the income streams to support the revenue pause dur short on our cottage hospice will be nhs continuing care
1	oh pause dur short right is this where you have your own budget
1	erm
1	no
1	it s kind of where you have your own budget so it gets
1	unclear you can you can buy and trunc s trunc unclear
1	it gets far too complex actually
1	mm okay
1	but some hospices have gone for nhs continuing care money in a big way so if you get a trunc d trunc when you get that diagnosis pause dur short about a terminal illness then you can apply for all your social care funding stuff
1	yeah
1	with your trunc p trunc and a personal budget if they give a personal budget
1	right
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	of course it s means tested so lots of people in well in anon type place don t get very much around social care
1	yeah
1	er but it s trunc to trunc run totally separate to the nhs which runs nhs continuing care pause dur short of with the criteria seems to me to be very complicated and i can t understand erm i can t understand the complexity of it so people don t know why they get it and why they don t get it etcetera etcetera but often people with a terminal illness can get fast tracked and get nhs continuing care money pause dur short which can then provide a huge care package for them for at home now often they use the same care trunc nurs trunc trunc n trunc care and nursing agencies as the social care budgets do
1	right
1	but it s a pot of money pause dur short which you can get on a weekly basis
1	yeah
1	as a patient particularly pause dur short with a terminal illness in your last year of life
1	right
1	and we as a hospice have never really tried to get into trunc ns trunc nhs continuing care
1	oh right
1	but with the cottage hospice i want to and i m
1	yeah
1	going to have the new nursing director pause dur short when he starts in january already get to look at nhs continuing care because we should claim nhs continuing care for our hospice in the home
1	but the pause dur short but anon type place and anon type place
1	they already have gone for it in a big way really
1	right pause dur short oh trunc g trunc they re they re gonna be really cross with you then
1	they re gonna be very cross pause dur short yeah i think pause dur short but it is part of the income stream i think it s about a hundred and thirty seven pounds a week i don t know that for sure cos it
1	right
1	differs different places unclear and the unclear
1	hundred and trunc th trunc whole hundred and thirty seven pounds a week
1	yeah hundred trunc p trunc whole thirty seven pounds
1	crikey that must buy you such a lot
1	but but i could be wrong about that so i m kind of erm it might be a day for all i know pause dur short but we need to look at it
1	yeah
1	in fact it d probably make more sense if it was a day wouldn t it pause dur short cos actually if you re going into a
1	trunc w trunc well
1	cos it s supposed to pay for you to go in that care home pause dur short and cut through it sorry pause dur short the nursing home you ll have to get into that one as well yeah care home is really about social care and is far less medical intervention a nursing home has nurses has to be registered and trunc t trunc and takes that money so it s probably hundred and thirty seven pounds a day
1	yeah
1	erm but we don t claim it well enough as a hospice and that knocks onto another issue about hospice in the home so often pause dur short we re going to look after people as hospice in the home pause dur short and they ve got nhs continuing care so the agency goes in then pause dur short looks after them and does various things for them and claims the money and we just go in and add value without claiming any money against that and i want to break that cycle
1	mm
1	and i particularly want to break the cycle when they re coming into a cottage hospice pause dur short most people coming out of a cottage hospice should be in receipt of nhs continuing care pause dur short we do sometimes claim it here in the inpatient unit but very rarely
1	right
1	because we re not long term it s not like they re gonna be in the nursing home for six weeks they re not supposed to be here for six weeks so we very rarely claim it but sometimes we claim it
1	oh right but so the reason you don t is because it s a long winded
1	you have to claim it pause dur short you have to claim it
1	unclear route unclear and somebody might be here for five days so you think well by the time we ve claimed it
1	yes unclear if you want to unclear pause dur short yes pause dur short you have to absolutely pause dur short but the funny thing is i don t think it stops the clock ticking so the agency that s not caring for them at home gets a hundred and thirty seven pounds a day for nothing cos they re not sending their people in to look after them
1	oh crikey right
1	so it s a bit of a mess that and i will have that unpicked before you start so that we have the position clear about it
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	but i do want i don t want to pull people into a cottage hospice and not claim the money that s pause dur short available from the statutory services as nhs continuing care
1	mm pause dur short mm mm pause dur short right
1	that enough pause dur short it s more than enough for your trunc ta trunc unclear you having a look at that tape unclear
1	erm pause dur short well if i ever make any sense of this again it would be a miracle
1	oh of course yeah
1	but pause dur short no i can listen to it again though this is the trunc advan trunc mind you they still
1	yeah pause dur short yeah
1	used to do this for interviews
1	yeah yeah
1	in the past okay that s pause dur short right okay but erm pause dur short okay no let s leave it there for the minute
1	that was just about a rationale to go there wasn t it that location
1	vocal desc laugh
1	but it wasn t
1	well no no no no but it s trunc ol trunc it s all the
1	it was more
1	the background trunc inf trunc and i can now sound intelligent when i talk to other people about it
1	yeah
1	so erm pause dur short but you said that you didn t think it was a new building pause dur short is that because unclear of the new unclear building
1	i think i ve changed my mind about that
1	okay
1	yeah yeah i think it s probably a new building
1	i think it s a new building
1	i didn t think it was originally pause dur short that s my view s changing
1	why did you think it wasn t a new building
1	i don t know actually i was wondering where you get your decisions from isn t it about your thought processes
1	well no when what s his face what was his name anon nametype m type name said to me
1	who
1	was it trunc p trunc no it was no no not anon nametype m type name who was the other trustee that i met
1	you met anon nametype m type name
1	anon nametype m type name
1	and anon nametype f type name
1	when anon nametype m type name said so you ve got a picture in your head then
1	anon nametype n type name pause dur short yeah yeah
1	to me
1	yeah
1	i thought oh good erm so what was the picture in your head
1	originally you mean or now
1	mm no originally
1	i think i thought we could convert a building
1	right
1	and then and that s just i think my pause dur short previous experiences of utilising buildings so if i think back to anon type place unclear or whatever unclear and that building i kind of converted that building to make it what we wanted pause dur short if i think about that anon type place centre which was a shell of the factory from anon type place we converted it be i didn t knock it down and build it again and i think it s my construct of buildings and what
1	mm
1	we ve done with buildings
1	mm mm
1	or even seeing bids unclear advisor trust was about conversion so newbuilds are not part of my consciousness and i think it really was as simple as that that you pull your experiences from where your experiences are really
1	unclear mm yeah unclear pause dur short mm pause dur short mm
1	erm
1	well i think it s possible if there s the right building
1	yes
1	so say if there was a disused school
1	yes
1	or an old or a trunc ho trunc not an old hotel but a hotel
1	yeah yeah
1	or erm pause dur short or an trunc ol trunc or a an old trunc in trunc indeed a cottage hospital that is disused
1	yeah yeah
1	an old nhs building that s disused
1	if you went
1	something like that possibly
1	if you went here they re not they re not that disused but er trunc b trunc i agree we could look and we
1	yeah
1	can also envisage that we at the moment we have a kind of erm agreement with unclear brackets unclear to find us shops that s unclear of trunc cour trunc unclear we don t pay them for that we only pay them when they find something
1	mm mm pause dur short mm mm
1	but they are erm pause dur short and anon nametype m type name s got a lot of experience of that kind of finding things and knowing things and contact cos we re
1	right
1	building furniture warehouses and furniture shops and so when he talks about three hundred square feet he has a great construct about what three hundred square feet looks like and i don t actually
1	right
1	i really struggle conceptually with it erm pause dur short and so we can trunc o trunc we can cast our once we know where we re going and it this might happen quite soon trunc f trunc if you pause dur short are accepting some of my logic around that and we get hlt to accept the logic then we could be telling people at twenty ninth and thirtieth this is where we re going guys
1	mm
1	for the first one
1	mm
1	for the first one
1	mm
1	erm then we could start looking and i agree that if we found the right thing we could convert but i also need to look about the costs cos the vat implications newbuild
1	yes
1	means it s probably better to have a newbuild pause dur short i suspect which was another part of that erm set up really
1	well yeah pause dur short twenty percent
1	yeah and also we haven t yet decided what s in it cos when you come with your blank piece of paper pause dur short there s lots of things like does it need a mortuary i don t think it does cos i think we need a relationship with a funeral director but that s interesting cos it depends how big it is
1	mm
1	trunc b trunc so there s so so the the you know so the conversion versus newbuild we haven t yet decided what s in it
1	no
1	i in my construct in my head you know i kind of see that there s six rooms or whatever or five or six rooms around it are all open off the centre of a of a you know a trunc w trunc a nurses station with a kind of kitchen thing so i ve got this thing in my head
1	mm
1	trunc u trunc with trunc a trunc where i always could see it pause dur short so that also probably means newbuild not conversion really but i think if we keep our options open
1	yeah pause dur short let s find a very large oast house
1	an oast house that d be good yeah
1	vocal desc laugh but then also you ve got the you ve also got pause dur short the communal areas
1	oh i agree yeah i we need i mean we don t know what they look like yet so that s another part of it

1	yeah
1	and the white pith come off in the middle

1	but i like anon type place
1	er that was the best
1	yeah pause dur short i like anon type place woods
1	if you can call a wood pause dur short cos they in the sixties they cut all them beautiful english oak down
1	yeah but it s all coming back now isn t it
1	three hundred years old they were
1	mm
1	and the idiots cut them down pause dur short do you know the sixties was a really bad time pause dur short i mean everyone think oh yeah that was great but they built stupid looking houses
1	mm
1	they built all them big er skyscraper things like anon type place and all that
1	yeah they did didn t they
1	and they were all damp and horrible pause dur short and they used to go black with mildew
1	yeah pause dur short they demolished loads of them didn t they
1	they trunc pu trunc pause dur short yeah they pulled em all down now pause dur short vocal desc laugh what a waste of time that was waste of money
1	mm pause dur short yeah
1	but there you go they had to house all them people at the time so pause dur short they just
1	was it a cheaper way of it must ve been a cheaper way of building
1	well trunc the trunc they they not only built
1	just concrete
1	yeah and that they used to have these big
1	mainly wasn t it the tower blocks
1	they used to have these big er concrete precast concrete that s what they used to call it
1	yeah
1	and they used to just stick em up and bolt em all together pause dur short and then seal em with something or other pause dur short but what they didn t know was that the concrete and the steel rods that they put in
1	mm
1	the concrete reacted with the steel rods
1	react pause dur short i know
1	and that just blew the concrete off and rotted the trunc ro trunc rods
1	what a mistake eh
1	well that was a quick way to build
1	mm
1	and they didn t know about that they didn t even pause dur short they they couldn t ve looked into it could they they couldn t ve researched that sort of thing
1	no they couldn t pause dur short they just assumed it would be alright
1	well pause dur short when they put these steel rods in flooring and what have you they pause dur short to to to reinforce the flooring they put these great big steel rods in didn t they
1	mm pause dur long
1	i suppose they got got over it now i don t know cos they still have to have steel rods to reinforce it
1	yeah pause dur short it was just like they used asbestos for loads of things and then they realised how dangerous that is
1	oh god yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short and there s still loads of asbestos about
1	yeah
1	the white one not the blue one

1	yeah
1	when that hit that place pause dur short there was the first year there was around about two hundred and sixty pause dur short they should ve stopped it then
1	but they obviously didn t know it was gonna spread like it did
1	well they should do cos ebola was terrible pause dur short they knew about trunc ebo trunc ebola
1	yeah
1	otherwise it wouldn t have a name
1	yeah
1	i mean if that was something new they would go oh whatever s that and

1	seventy five percent of people die from it
1	yeah
1	i dunno pause dur short well they thought aids was going to wipe out the world but that didn t did it
1	no
1	now they think trunc ebo trunc ebola s going to be the most dangerous thing in the world
1	yeah
1	but the whole point about these diseases are they come along and kill off so many people pause dur short and so many people are immune to it pause dur short so those people who are immune to it
1	yeah
1	live
1	yes it s
1	it s a weird old world it s i mean it s been happening ever since man began if you like ain t it
1	mm

1	that was terrible pollution
1	i thought there was a problem with all sorts of diseases unclear just pollution
1	no that isn t that s that s terrible pollution and
1	yeah

0	the work s do
0	well yeah pause dur short i suppose i just sort of carried on and just didn t give into it pause dur short i just thought well look calm yourself down pause dur short calm down
0	i just felt yeah i couldn t catch my breath pause dur short i felt sick pause dur short i was shaking pause dur short i just thought oh well um i just told anon nametype f type name i m just going to the loo pause dur short i ll be back in a minute
0	you have taken a new job in your
0	yeah it does pause dur short it s it s a new team pause dur short it s new work
0	yeah
0	right
0	and in my head when i was twenty one i thought by the time i m thirty i will have at least have a man if not be married
0	and with a potential for children at some time in my thirties pause dur short and now that i m here i think well there s no man on the scene pause dur short therefore kinder would be a a number of years later
0	like i don t know whether i should move here or there pause dur short or do this job or that job pause dur short and then start to trunc pan trunc really panic myself pause dur short and i think just calm down it s fine pause dur short but the more times that i get panicked about it the worse it seems to be pause dur short so i think i just need to make a plan pause dur short just any plan pause dur short whatever the plan is pause dur short even if it turns out to be shit at least it s a plan
0	we have each other
0	erm
0	yeah but you ve had blokes in that time though pause dur short you ve had options and dalliances and
0	i mean i was only half joking when i said you lose a part of your soul each time
0	yeah pause dur short i had a bath earlier pause dur short maybe that s what
0	don t do that
0	vocal desc laugh just unclear
0	well it s because i was getting what i thought was my wisdom teeth coming through pause dur short but the pain is also like here as well
0	shit man pause dur short just wisdom teeth
0	um
0	well you d think something pause dur short there must be something good about ageing pause dur short there isn t anything good so far pause dur short there s nothing that springs immediately to mind
0	i think they re self imposed
0	own a house
0	mm
0	i didn t know a single person in the embassy that owned their own house
0	mm
0	not a single one of them pause dur short um
0	yeah
0	i mean our parents had it quite good
0	mm
0	i ll be their aunty anon nametype f type name pause dur short erm
0	i think well what i need is a plan
0	i was a bit like right okay so now what
0	yeah pause dur short that might be because that s what you d been always working towards
0	and you if you lose that
0	and and now what
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	i mean they say there s not but there isn t
0	yeah
0	i know it s like i m quite lucky to enjoy my job
0	yeah
0	it s not specific to elt so again i m quite fortunate in that regard pause dur short but it does mean that i have to find a way of making my skill set unique to an employer in another country pause dur short rather than just hire somebody that they have there
0	yeah yeah
0	which is just unrealistic pause dur short you re not gonna see everywhere
0	i d like to visit every country at least once
0	no
0	even though they re saying on er rightmove i was having a look the other day that there s they ve brought something out to help first time buyers pause dur short all this sort of gobbins pause dur short so like which if you re still interested you should look at
0	but i m still never going to be able to get together half of the deposit for round here
0	and that it s not just the deposit pause dur short it s about finding a lender
0	mm mm
0	because your mortgage will probably be in the region of you know six hundred to nine hundred pound a month
0	no
0	at the same time it s not on my list of priorities
0	yeah
0	versus travelling around the world with a backpack on my back pause dur short do you know what i mean
0	if you are super happy travelling and that s the thing that makes you happy that s what you have to go for
0	would you look back and think i wish i d done this or that was a bad idea or i should have done more about that pause dur short i wish i hadn t even bothered worrying about that pause dur short cos that s like a technique
0	there s loads and loads of different causes of panic attacks pause dur short i mean with me i think i was bored and so
0	so i think it mine was kind of like from boredom
0	too much going on in my brain
0	like me i haven t been out for a meal in quite a while
0	like when i didn t want to go flying anywhere
0	and i was absolutely terrified pause dur short and the first four sort of three of four flights were absolutely horrendous pause dur short i thought i was gonna be sick pause dur short i was sweating
0	avoid it like the plague
0	and if you and if you run off before you ve experienced it
0	but at least if i was you know i was living in a crack den but it s okay cos i m saving money and it means that in a year i m going to be doing something amazing
0	now pause dur short but i know that in a year s time or whenever there s gonna be another challenge pause dur short there s going to be something interesting and exciting and then something to aim for
0	mm
0	i think if i stayed there i would be living in anon type place for the next five years pause dur short and i m never going to meet a man here pause dur short not that that s the be all and end all
0	mm
0	it was the monsoon season
0	oh god like
0	yeah
0	whereas when i was in australia i was on my own pause dur short and i was going to see exciting places pause dur short and it was different like just having to fly between places and meet new people and pause dur short i don t know it s just i get that buzz when i do that
0	yeah pause dur short what s
0	and i get really excited pause dur short and i live for that pause dur short and like that s the most important thing
0	money pause dur short financially i couldn t do it
0	i d go now pause dur short i would get my passport
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	cos she s finding it really tough
0	oh i can t remember pause dur short yeah i don t know i can t remember
0	yeah something different
0	ooh i don t i er generally don t know where i ve been
0	for the last twenty eight years
0	yeah
0	what it s like when you re at uni pause dur short and you go to the student union pause dur short and you know everybody and
0	every night you re doing something and
0	you come down to reality with a quite a hard bang
0	yeah
0	so it s pretty cheap pause dur short it s cheaper than what she d be paying in norwich pause dur short so she s managed to save quite a lot of money pause dur short and she s quite savvy with money unlike moi
0	find a dealer pause dur short or a shop of something
0	i need to get them unclear like i need to get a quote for them
0	mm
0	i m not talking about street walking
0	because second jobs are not the answer unless they are escorting
0	that s quite a lot pause dur short maybe get a pen and paper
0	that is so expensive
0	yep
0	yeah
0	say sixty quid for a tank of petrol
0	no i try and make soup every week pause dur short but if you say two hundred pounds for food pause dur short cos what s that a hundred and fifty pounds for food pause dur short say forty quid a week pause dur short four fours are a hundred and sixty
0	yeah pause dur short what i need to do is then take the money out at the end of the month and if it s not there not spend it pause dur short shift new singing rescue me shift new normal pause dur short the thing about listening to kiss is that it is literally the same four songs on repeat
0	i thought you were gonna say it makes you wanna go out pause dur short i was like yeah it does pause dur short whoop whoop
0	it does make me wanna go out pause dur short that too
0	and be an old hab
0	five pause dur short six pause dur short seven pause dur short eight sixty pause dur short nine twenty you can t you can t even use a calculator
0	for fuck s sake pause dur short what are you like you animal pause dur short you ve done something really wrong
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah clearly pause dur short you ve done something very wrong
0	maths was never my strong point pause dur short you know that pause dur short i ve always been a an artiste
0	oh what s that say vocal desc laugh four hundred and eighty nine pause dur short what the hell
0	petrol

0	and that is only fifty pounds a week pause dur short i mean that is pause dur short is that quite yeah that is pause dur short maybe that s quite a lot
0	she ll just be faffing around unclear
0	oh like anon nametype f type name
0	yeah
0	she s just a bit scatty
0	yeah pause dur short how much money would you wanna have if for example you did wanna go travelling
0	okay
0	okay
0	so i need to be trunc t trunc so in march pause dur short so yeah i could book things in march next year
0	yeah
0	that would give me five thousand pounds
0	hundred
0	i d save two hundred pounds more every month for
0	um but actually if that if that was just for september october november jan feb and you knew you were off in march for example
0	it would literally be six months pause dur short and two sixes are twelve so that d be an extra grand
0	it s worth doing isn t it
0	oh pause dur short oh was it
0	okay
0	okay pause dur short done
0	the really hard thing though is
0	but you ve done really well like in berlin you could ve just sacked it off pause dur short you could have booked flights to thailand pause dur short you could ve done pause dur short cos you ve found it quite hard going you know being quite unclear
0	yeah
0	yeah pause dur short but do you know what though i was saying to anon nametype f type name the other day some days i i could go three days without spending a single cent because i say say like someone has like got food in the house and i would walk to work and i wouldn t go out pause dur short i could literally go there days without spending money pause dur short here day in day out i ve got my train fare
0	mm
0	and i m in pret for at least breakfast at least lunch possibly breakfast as well
0	vocal desc laugh
0	erm i might use my oyster to go on the tube pause dur short might meet anon nametype n type name for a drink pause dur short go out to the cinema with anon nametype f type name maybe pause dur short something blah blah
0	yeah
0	no but you also have been trawling the charity shops so it s not like you ve been
0	yeah no no pause dur short that really nice kate moss dress is from the charity shop and hopefully i ll make a profit on it pause dur short fingers crossed
0	no pause dur short it s an olympics desk officer
0	oh man
0	mm
0	she is the best person to speak to about not spending any money
0	she s the ultimate pause dur short ultimate pause dur short trunc sh trunc yeah but she s not tight with it pause dur short it s really funny pause dur short but then she will she s also got a lot more strict with herself so so a lot of her friends wanna go for er trunc m trunc trunc m trunc er meals and dinners like pause dur short two of them are one step away from being a partner in their law firm pause dur short so they ve got
0	a lot of money
0	whereas she ll be like that pause dur short let s go for coffee pause dur short she will sip that coffee till it is stone cold
0	erm and she ll be like that pause dur short no i can t come and do that because i haven t got any money
0	i ve seen her bank statements pause dur short she s literally got no money pause dur short cos i opened it by accident pause dur short i thought it was sent to me pause dur short erm but she s like i really wanna go travelling pause dur short i ve gotta get out pause dur short i ve gotta get away pause dur short i m gonna hammer it over the summer doing
0	i suppose then he s a bit funny isn t he pause dur short like when he was like yeah i m moving to london
0	yeah
0	ha
0	but anon type place s pretty cool i ve gotta say
0	it s good isn t it pause dur short i mean anon nametype f type name likes living in the prison pause dur short i find it quite intriguing that she s in the prison
0	oh god
0	okay pause dur short and they d start off in a shit room and then
0	yeah cos you need a mortgage
0	yeah
0	kill her
0	oh right
0	she s lovely pause dur short she s a really nice girl but we would get on each other s nerves
0	erm but that might tie in cos her flight s booked her return flight s booked for february pause dur short but she s gonna extend it if she needs to
0	a couple of months after that pause dur short erm then yeah pause dur short or i could book it at the beginning of the year couldn t i i suppose pause dur short cos i d have money and i i i d leave in april
0	but when i flew at christmas
0	on boxing day they were one thousand pound return
0	okay
0	cos what i d be inclined to do would be whenever you hit enough money for the flight
0	because then that way
0	i was gonna go at the end of the year pause dur short that was my original plan pause dur short but in september when the job came up i was like well i m gonna i m gonna stay and take that
0	yeah
0	erm and er really my plan was when we got back from croatia to stay at and to stay at my mum s and work my arse off
0	like i had to pay my deposit and
0	but i think yeah you re right pause dur short i ll probably book the flight for like yeah maybe start of the year
0	when at what at what point of of the year are they cheap cos you know like if you book them really far in advance you get an early bird deal or
0	mm pause dur short well the winter would be cheap pause dur short so
0	okay
0	is that the cheapest way
0	between april and september are the cheapest flights cos that s when it s winter pause dur short sort of september round to march is peak season
0	if my flights on boxing day were a thousand pounds
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	mm
0	ah
0	yeah
0	and just say to her look can i just sleep on your floor for a couple of weeks i ll take a sleeping bag pause dur short and i will actively look for jobs straight away
0	erm but it would take time so i d like do a bit of sight seeing in that time pause dur short and maybe fly over to sydney and see tasha and get a job started straight away and then i could move out
0	yeah
0	mm
0	yeah
0	ah how sweet
0	it took her ten years to do her phd because she decided to have kids in between
0	hilarious
0	yeah anon nametype m type name yeah yeah
0	and erm see if a job ever comes up pause dur short cos it s a different business stream pause dur short it s education as opposed to english language teaching pause dur short it s slightly different pause dur short erm but my job would be the same pause dur short erm i might talk to anon nametype f type name because she works in education pause dur short she does my job at the senior level
0	yeah yeah
0	yeah
0	whoa vocal desc laugh
0	god what the hell s the matter with me
0	i think from this point on i need to just start being more savvy with money
0	budget for before
0	yeah
0	it s much easier to do that pause dur short and i don t have to worry pause dur short and i can take whatever i need for the wedding and that
0	okay
0	in kemptown pause dur short in the b and b
0	those short term sacrifices
0	and barcelona s beautiful
0	april and may pause dur short if i m not careful pause dur short erm and then anon nametype m type name wants to go to anon type place or anon type place for her birthday in june pause dur short like the jubilee weekend so that s the beginning of june
0	costly
0	but like if it was in anon nametype m type name s birthday like if we drive there ll be four of us in the car so we ll just all chip in for petrol
0	yeah
0	so like keep an eye on stuff that s actually selling and see see if you ve got any like labelled clothes for example

0	erm no real plans for the day pause dur short i ve got to go and do a few bits in town pause dur short take some stuff back which is nice pause dur short rather than spend money

0	she s got a friend who s got cancer and it s really yeah pause dur short it s pretty um pretty serious pause dur short got some sort of rare cancer
0	oh god
0	mm
0	obviously she s a trunc depressi trunc a depressive so it s obviously quite um she s really quite volatile about stuff like that so
0	it s difficult yeah
0	good
0	the thing is she doesn t ever talk to me pause dur short it s the complete opposite of you with your mum when she s you know she s not sort of like you know unclear
0	yeah pause dur short maybe from anon nametype f type name to anon nametype f type name to anon nametype f type name to me or something so
0	also want her to to know that she can if she wants to but
0	it should be all upward pause dur short escalate up pause dur short don t cascade down
0	that s it pause dur short that s it that s it pause dur short well we ve already had it cascading down
0	she likes her garden and she s pause dur short when i went round last weekend she d been out in the garden digging which for her is a really good sign pause dur short like last year she wasn t pause dur short she didn t really feel motivated to get out unclear
0	i think she had quite a difficult time of it pause dur short whereas this year she feels like
0	mm
0	yeah
0	no
0	she s always been like that pause dur short oh yeah she was really bad when we were growing up pause dur short really bad pause dur short i think because with richard s pause dur short you know imagine if you knew something was wrong with your kid but no one believed you pause dur short and everyone thought it was you being a bad mum
0	mm
0	mm
0	badly behaved
0	or unruly or blah blah blah
0	mm
0	mm pause dur short yeah
0	um anon nametype m type name keeps texting me
0	shall i meet anon nametype m type name
0	no you ve gotta meet him
0	coffee
0	oh do they i didn t pause dur short i would be like that pause dur short i ll have a latte thank you
0	unclear maybe that s what everyone s going on about
0	maybe that s what the kids
0	i don t know i would i would have genuinely thought coffee meant coffee and abs meant abs
0	no no yeah i ve gotta make a move anyway
0	unclear
0	yeah i haven t seen anon nametype f type name in like years
0	yeah
0	and i was like fine not a problem at all
0	ah
0	anon nametype m type name nice but dim pause dur short is he still on the scene
0	yeah
0	oh did she
0	yeah so they don t actually
0	is she still living in your room
0	yeah pause dur short but the house is being sold
0	is it anon nametype f type name anon nametype f type name and then two other girls
0	mm
0	and then erm
0	staying in london
0	yep
0	wait are you going for trunc coff trunc what s what s the what do you ring the bell
0	and then where do you go then
0	bootie call yeah
0	well let me pee then
0	well this is the first time it ll have happened pause dur short if it happens which i m still not sure about since the we ve all broken up pause dur short actually no we did try and break up once before pause dur short not that we were ever together pause dur short that was what was so hilarious pause dur short we had a conversation where he texted me saying i m like crying right now pause dur short erm you re so nice pause dur short you seem more into this than i am pause dur short because he d been round to here and we d like cooked dinner together
0	and we had a conversation and er i was like i don t wanna see you as as a boyfriend pause dur short i don t want anything like that
0	i think when everyone s drunk you can get away with that sort of stuff
0	quarter to bedtime
0	they re bastards pause dur short i thought i did a return journey pause dur short lol pause dur short oh yeah start at union lane pause dur short oh you re right it is arbury road pause dur short interesting
1	button start recording okay that s started recording pause dur short and that one i think has started recording if i trunc mi trunc yes it has okay so erm anon nametype f type name and i are going to talk about erm er er something that we ve both been going through erm over the last few months and years which is our experiences of having cancer and being treated for cancer specifically gynaecological cancers and we re doing this recording with two objects erm number one is towards the cambridge university press erm research but secondly we re hoping that the tape will be used as well by a charity which is called the eve appeal erm which erm is campaigning on erm a greater awareness of trunc gynaec trunc trunc gyn trunc i can t even say it gynaecological cancers vocal desc laugh amongst obviously amongst women er in erm in this country and erm are interested in the views of some of their members and supporters er in the awareness of cancer and the symptoms of cancer et cetera amongst young people er in particular so we re gonna talk about that and the other thing we re gonna talk about is about the cancers that we ve had and our experiences of of having cancer so we re gonna talk about body parts and stuff like that as well because vocal desc laugh part of what the eve appeal has discovered is that younger women are less likely to know the parts of their body involved be able to locate them on a map of the body and actually be able to use the terminology so although there s an assumption in our society that younger people are freer and easier about sex and and er health et cetera this turns out from a recent piece of research to be not at all the case so i don t know what you felt when you read that press release that they put out
1	well i was so shocked actually er and baffled because erm the point is that many people die because they feel too embarrassed to go to their doctor and use words like vagina or vulva and er and obviously the earlier you can get get cancers the better and this thing to tie in with this project cos it s also a language issue so it just seems a rather nice tie up to do
1	yeah
1	erm so interestingly thinking about language erm you know er it s i suppose to use words the ones er where the synonyms for them are are kind of off putting and rather horrible and and their clinical terms sound clinical so er so just isn t a kind of nice word is there erm so vagina or vulva that s it you you might feel comfortable with erm the kind of the slang would be possibly derogatory unclear
1	no and then when you go and see the doctor and they say i m afraid i m gonna have to stick my finger up your back passage
1	yeah
1	and you sort of think oh vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh
1	that s a bit weird as well and the the doctor using kind of baby language or something
1	yeah yeah exactly i mean the language that doctors use i have actually interestingly found erm that the language they use to you is quite subtly different to the language that they write to your gp
1	mm
1	so sometimes erm i have the consultation with the oncologist and i think i i ve got it what she said and then when i get the copy of the letter to the doctor i find that the language is slightly different and actually the meaning is slightly different as well which is quite interesting
1	yeah
1	and so perhaps they also recoil at using words like that
1	and a lot of them are young women as well
1	they are yes exactly i mean my oncologist is unclear a woman unclear
1	mm
1	erm and er yeah that that s kind of odd isn t it and so how does one get people trunc t trunc to realise that it s a lot less daunting to go to your doctor and say the word vagina or the word vulva than it is to get cancer
1	yeah
1	which
1	well perhaps actually if these young women don t know can t point to a picture of what is what when they re shown a diagram then perhaps the doctors aren t using the proper language because they trunc d trunc they think the hearer s not gonna
1	yeah true
1	understand it
1	yeah unclear
1	and er but they i mean if i was a doctor i would probably assume that it was the ladies of sixty seventy eighty that that didn t use those words or didn t like those words or didn t understand what those words referred to and that it would actually conversely be the younger women who trunc ha trunc erm had done personal and social health education at school or biology o level or gcse more recently who would be able to say oh yes and pin the tail on the donkey trunc th trunc vocal desc laugh easily
1	yeah
1	given a diagram
1	exactly
1	but actually it seems to be the younger women who are having the difficulty and is that because biology is optional at school these days i mean what what is that about
1	i really don t know it s trunc w trunc it i i really really don t know why that is whether they are thinking of examining that at all or studying it at all wonder if it s just
1	mm it s just a huge gap
1	that we re more squeamish or whether people of an older age were just more down to earth about their bodies or
1	i don t know but that cos at first i thought okay they said women in erm a particular age group which was er what age group was it erm pause dur short women aged sixty six to seventy five and i thought well okay erm pause dur short perhaps it s because older women have had babies but then you and i haven t had babies
1	no
1	so erm but we trunc st trunc trunc st trunc thought you know perhaps i think well perhaps they you picked up the language about the body parts during obstetric trunc con trunc consultations erm but it s not necessarily that
1	yeah and also i mean the the other surprising thing anyway is that you know it was meant to be like cancer was the sort of big unmentionable subject in
1	yeah
1	those days
1	yeah
1	and actually it s mentioned all the time now
1	yeah
1	and so it s not the big unmentionable subject but perhaps conversely because it is mentioned so much people are maybe more frightened of it than they were before i don t know because you you just read so much stuff about it
1	yeah
1	erm it s it s just a very strange
1	i mean the other thing that strikes me in that that really depresses me is that when you hear stories about young people and sex and pregnancy it still seems to be the case that girls aren t enjoying sex particularly they re doing sex cos boys want it pause dur short boys and girls are learning about sex through the internet and through watching pornography which gives them a completely unrealistic picture of what it s all about and what it can be like and in particular girls that that sort of portrayal is not particularly helpful for girls and for girls having a healthy sex life and then you also then hear that girls are doing it under duress and they re not really enjoying it they re doing it cos boys want them to do it
1	yeah
1	and you just think after all these years of effort about sex education and liberation of women and you ve still got a situation in which young women are missing out in this vocal desc laugh really really major way on something that s really important in life and perhaps those two things are going together then perhaps that sort of ignorance about having a healthy joyous sex life and not knowing about what your bits are called and what they do trunc perha trunc you know perhaps it s all of a piece so and that actually sex the whole sex education thing has just gone to pot
1	i don t know but i mean i suppose aligned with that is all the other pressure on women to look perfect and
1	mm
1	looking up the sort of airbrushed models of perfection all the time and maybe there s something about body image in that erm that perhaps we didn t used to have you know
1	well people are having plastic surgery now in their
1	yeah well exactly so that sort of erm i mean it and it s sort of ironic isn t it that kind of the likes of you who have been mauled over by major surgery but we re glad to be here on the planet really vocal desc laugh never mind what we look like you know we re glad to exist erm
1	yeah
1	so it s a it s a strange er you know it s a very long journey you go on from er from being too worried to say the word to to i mean unclear that you ve got cancer you know you just can t be squeamish cos there s lots of stuff that s gonna happen to you and erm you know trunc n trunc it s none of it s pleasant and er you know you ve gotta deal with the fact that nurses are gonna have to clear up after you and you know trunc n trunc embarrassing and horrible but that s life
1	yeah well i mean
1	and that s
1	i was at the hospital yesterday for a check up and anon nametype m type name was with me erm erm and so er they sort of they feel all your glands and then they stick a speculum in your vagina and they look look to see what s there and then they feel and then they stick their fingers up your bum as well and then erm so and my husband s just sitting there on the other side of a curtain and the first time this happens he said pause dur short trunc pre trunc but you you just lay there and they did that to you and like this is really extraordinary i said yeah trunc th trunc i mean that s been done thousands of times hundreds of times you know vocal desc laugh and he found it really strange that you could meet somebody and the next minute they re poking vocal desc laugh you around like that
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and he he couldn t believe it and he said is that what women have to put up with and i said yeah yeah yeah yeah you know have it from the age of whenever from teenage years upwards from the time when you have your first smear or erm you know you first have a er any kind of gynae problem erm you just get used to sort of hopping on the couch and putting your legs in stirrups and stuff like that and he was horrified erm and he will hardly go to the doctor about anything let alone the prospect of somebody sticking their fingers up his bum when he goes
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so that vocal desc laugh too bad so so i i trunc d trunc well perhaps as women you do get used to stuff trunc p trunc people kind of poking around in your nether regions and vocal desc laugh
1	well i mean i think i mean i think that an equivalent with men and prostate cancer and trunc m trunc bowel cancer as well that you know
1	mm
1	they don t go for those things either and er
1	no
1	erm and those sort of all also embarrassing things maybe there s a need for a kind of common cause across the cancers to erm to just get you know to say look don t be squeamish cos trunc y trunc your life is on the line here and it s
1	yeah
1	better to go and talk to someone and these doctors and nurses they ve seen it all before that s what they do day in day out you know and our bits don t know any different to anybody else s vocal desc laugh bits and
1	no
1	you know that s what they re trained to do and
1	er although actually i remember once having a cyst erm on my vulva erm which which got infected in the end and having to go to the doctor because it trunc th trunc trunc s trunc this sort of giant lump which vocal desc laugh was really quite painful and sore and everything and went to see a doctor but just booked in to see the doctor the trunc n trunc next nearest doctor who turned out to be a young asian woman and when i said i had a cyst erm trunc sh trunc and the look of absolute distaste that went across her face was really and then so she said oh trunc y trunc i d better have a look and i got on the couch and her face was just she was just really repulsed and i d and i was and i was mortified at the time and then afterwards i thought you know what trunc y trunc you know that would be enough to make you not go back quite
1	yeah
1	clearly
1	yeah
1	and it was only it was er only a second or two until she caught herself and sort of thought right you know i d better get on with this you know i ve gotta do it and but but i saw the look go across her face very very plainly so i think trunc peo trunc that is exactly what people are scared of exactly what they re scared of there s somebody thinking oh that s disgusting ah
1	yeah yeah
1	and i suppose if i had been bolshier i might have kind of picked her up on it and but i didn t i just went away and erm and then when i did have cancer erm it took me pause dur short quite a while to feel that my symptoms were severe enough to justify bothering the doctor because i went and i was going and i was saying look i ve got these symptoms pause dur short and the doctor was saying oh that s very unclear i wonder what that is and and i kept sort of thinking to myself should i go back should i shall i say something shall i say that the you know that that what she s done so far hasn t sorted this out and and so every few months i would go back and i d say okay well i m still i m still bleeding and and she would say oh that s a bit strange erm er to the point where i sort of though well perhaps it s not of interest at all vocal desc laugh
1	well i mean i do think one of the most important things is to educate women
1	mm
1	about what s normal and what isn t normal
1	yeah
1	and and what to ask for
1	yeah
1	and maybe it s quite a good thing on this tape to say something about what your symptoms were and if you were doing it again and you were going to advise a young woman sort of in your position you know what what what would you have done differently do you think
1	oh well i trunc d trunc well it s like and haven t even asked you what your cancer was
1	oh well mine was ovarian
1	it was ovarian okay alright so mine was endometrial cancer which is erm a cancer of the lining of the womb pause dur short and erm it is most prevalent in women post menopause so the way usually what happens is that i think or i gather is a women will have her menopause and her periods will stop and then after menopause she ll have an unexpected bleed which is either a one off thing erm which my mother actually had when she was in her seventies just all of a sudden a cascade of blood out of nowhere after years and years of having been you know post menopause or else persistent bleeding so erm so i think that s trunc probab trunc the reason cos i was er gosh how old was i fifty three or something and i hadn t finished my periods i think that s the reason why the doctor didn t think that there was anything sinister about me just having this persistent bleeding but in retrospect i hit fifty and when i hit fifty i didn t i trunc wa trunc i trunc wa trunc just wasn t well in this really weird kind of unaccountable kind of way and i couldn t work out what was wrong with me but i was just distinctly out of sorts and then erm i started to get erm my periods having sort of tailed off and got lighter and lighter and lighter started to get slightly heavier periods and a bit of pain and erm and then they sort of tailed off again and then i started spotting and then the spotting became permanent erm so it was happening all the time erm and then later on it got more persistent so there was more blood and
1	how long a period was that i mean
1	well this is probably this is probably over eighteen months to two years
1	okay
1	during which time i i went to the doctor and i said look i ve got this persistent spotting and erm and she trunc s trunc and she sort of said oh i think it s probably going to be your thyroid that s out of whack cos i also said well i ve put on a lot of weight over the last year or two and erm i don t think i m doing anything particularly different but i just keep on seem to get fatter and fatter all the time so she said oh i think it s probably your thyroid because the bleeding will be consistent with thyroid problem so she sent me for tests and indeed i did have underactive thyroid so she put me on levothyroxine and then erm and then i sort of on a hunch sort of said to her oh and i haven t had my blood pressure taken for ages and it turned out i had absolutely sky high blood pressure as well so they put me on drugs for that and then as i went back to the doctor for checkups cos when they put you on levothyroxine they have to keep doing blood tests to work out if you re on the right level of of drugs and to control your and bring your body up to the right level of kind of trunc m trunc trunc m trunc metabolism and then also erm with my blood pressure i was going cos i didn t get on with the drugs so i was being tested for different drugs to trunc contr trunc try and control my blood pressure and every time i went back i said to her you know i m still bleeding and she would say oh that s really really strange that that should have been sorted out by now so she was really definitely pinning my bleeding onto my thyroid problem and it was only after about eighteen months that she said i think you d better see a gynaecologist and then i i got and sent up to anon type place and they did er er a scrape so just erm stuck a a oh a trunc d trunc a a kind of swab i suppose through my cervix and into my womb and just took a swab of the lining of my womb and then erm about a week later i got a call saying you d better come to the hospital this afternoon please so trunc th trunc it was it was a very very simple test for endometriosis and actually it can t cost that much because it s just as long as they can get their little unclear dibber unclear through your cervix
1	yeah
1	which they can t always
1	and and do we know why they don t do that when they are doing cervical screening tests why do they not do that at the same time
1	i don t know well it s just it s like breast cancer isn t it like if you say as a women and you ve got cancer people go oh is it breast cancer because there s so much awareness of breast cancer and there s also a lot of awareness of cervical cancer i mean i know
1	yeah
1	you know
1	and they have all these checks all the time
1	yeah and i trunc kn trunc but you know you ve got anomalies like people like jade goody who managed to not ever have a well i don t know i think she was possibly too young to have smears but you know that you still get people who are not going for their smear tests
1	no
1	but but the awareness
1	but i mean while you re doing that here
1	is so much higher
1	you re not actually testing for the endometrial
1	no because you
1	cancer are you you re
1	no
1	the so that and it wouldn t require a great deal more cos you are putting the whatever they call that this thing up and taking a swab
1	yeah
1	so actually why not take a swab of the endometrial unclear why unclear i don t know
1	i don t know i mean i think it is a bit it er some people can t take it some people have got such a tight cervix that they can t get their little tube up there
1	yeah
1	erm and other people erm and it does actually hurt it feels like
1	yeah
1	you re being stabbed
1	yeah
1	in the cervix so erm and i er probably a lot of women would just say oh no you ve got to stop it s just too painful so
1	oh well maybe they don t want to do it because they think that would put women off having the
1	yeah
1	cervical test
1	yeah
1	i mean
1	but then also
1	and unclear
1	i trunc s trunc i don t know what the prevalence of the different cancers is whether trunc m trunc my i don t know this might be completely uninformed but my hunch is that there s more women around with cervical cancer
1	sure yeah i m sure that s right
1	than there are with endometrial cancer
1	yeah
1	and and also my hunch and and also this trunc gynae trunc gynaecological support group that i m in the older women seem to have ovarian cancer and the younger women seem to have cervical cancer
1	yeah
1	so i don t know whether there s a kind of shift in the patterns of cancer or oh i don t know whether it s about awareness campaigns and there just being more awareness of cervical cancer now which means that it looks like there are more people suffering but it s really that more people and
1	who are coming forward
1	no er
1	i mean
1	coming forward
1	trunc ye trunc and to follow your story right through but you know just to pause on the screening bit cos that s something i think is really important and i ve worked in screening so i have some understanding of how it works but erm but screening programmes are decided on or not according to whether as a population whether they do more good than harm
1	mm
1	and the harm can be getting false erm readings that look positive
1	yeah
1	or sending people off for treatments they don t need
1	yeah
1	and so
1	as with prostate
1	there is a little risk thing so i do respect that er and i know there is a study er going on at the moment about looking at erm more screening for gynae cancers erm but what i kind of feel is that if if ovarian cancer and and these other cancers gynae cancers don t meet that threshold you still do have an opportunity where women come regularly hopefully most of them to do the cervical smear test
1	mm
1	and at the very least it seems to me one could be providing those women with information about the other cancers and saying to them
1	yes
1	this is what the symptoms would look like if
1	yeah
1	you have those symptoms do not be afraid to to go to your erm you know to ask your gp erm don t be put off by the language thing and ask for these particular tests so
1	yeah
1	you know erm in the case of ovarian cancer erm the first test would be a blood test called ca
1	mm
1	now that s not an expensive thing to do
1	oh isn t it
1	gps are doing all gps do blood tests all the time it s just
1	yeah
1	one more
1	yeah
1	you know parameter that you can ask for
1	and that s the trunc tha trunc and that s the test for
1	and so that
1	for endometrial as well
1	right so
1	yeah
1	i mean those tests are not you know difficult
1	no
1	for gps to organise in any way and then obviously if that comes back it s it s indicative but not diagnostic so that
1	yeah
1	we have to send people off for other tests but you know what i m trying to say is i think that you know you have a captive audience
1	yeah
1	of people and you were talking about gynae cancers at that point and yet no conversation is had about these other tests and er just because there isn t a full on national screening programme erm does that mean we can t even mention them or raise awareness or give people a leaflet or at least make them aware
1	mm
1	er and you know it seems to be that s an absolutely ideal opportunity to do that with
1	it would
1	along with other er ad hoc interventions that they might have with their gp which might be around hrt treatment erm in the case of ovarian cos it tends to be more older people but could be around family planning
1	yeah
1	you know just so it s people should know what the symptoms are
1	well no absolutely
1	and and we should follow your story and then i ll say a bit about kind of trunc sym trunc the normal symptoms of having ovarian cancer
1	well i mean i was gonna comment on that because erm when i was in my pause dur short er when i was about thirty my next door neighbour died of ovarian cancer and she was a erm she was quite a challenging woman cos she was really highly strung and really nervous and she she did panic she had a sort of quite a lot of ocd and and she was always on edge about stuff and really sort of erm a bit kind of i trunc d trunc be to use a very non pc word really neurotic about stuff pause dur short and she had had symptoms for years and years and years and it turned out to be ovarian cancer and she had been dismissed by her doctors as just being a hysterical woman
1	yeah
1	with these sort of er these symptoms which were were said by them or interpreted by them to be a sign of her neuroticism and trunc h trunc and her borderline sort of hysteria but when vocal desc laugh the fact that her getting to stage four pause dur short ovarian cancer without being diagnosed so by the time she was diagnosed she was she d had it she was done for erm and you know so this is actually this is actually bloody scary stuff because everybody knows with breast cancer you look for a lump pause dur short and trunc ev trunc and everybody is sort of they ask you have you been looking for lumps you know when was the last time you examined your breast you you go and have a smear for cervical cancer i had no idea to until recently that there was such a thing as cancer of the vulva pause dur short or cancer of the vagina and actually that makes my blood run cold because i you know to this day i don t even know what the symptoms of those are erm you know although i do know what the symptoms of ovarian cancer are but coming back to my previous theme about going to your doctor it s one of the kind of things that you go to a doctor about and they think oh well that could be anything and it s probably ibs it s probably
1	irritable bowel syndrome
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	erm or it s you know some some woman at her time of life just being you know like god knows what they think but erm but the symptoms were not definitive enough that a doctor has alarm bells going oh my god must get a blood test must send them off to a doctor must send them for an ultrasound
1	yeah
1	et cetera so it i mean it seems to be the doctors are very are scientists and they re very practical people and so i think my the doctor i went to see that i went to see because she said i ve got a
1	vocal desc cough
1	specialism in gynae stuff erm i think she looked and thought fifty two the odds are that it s x and y but you know the chance of it being cancer are you know one in twenty or something so therefore i m not even gonna go down that avenue i m gonna follow the most logical explanation of these symptoms
1	yeah
1	so
1	it s actually funnily enough mine actually to their credit did the absolute opposite
1	oh really
1	she said to me cos i went in and said with bleeding persistent bleeding and and she said well let s get the nasty scary things out of the picture first and then we ll
1	trunc g trunc oh
1	see if it s something simple
1	yeah
1	so she did actually on my first visit erm
1	wow
1	send me off to the hospital vocal desc laugh
1	and how did
1	and got trunc lo trunc
1	and what what s the what s diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer
1	well i mean mine was not usual er the the normal erm symptoms of ovarian cancer are feelings of being intolerably bloated
1	mm
1	because what happens is the the erm er the the body creates a lot of fluids in the
1	oh really
1	abdominal area so people do get very very bloated sometimes they can have like litres and litres and litres of this fluid which has to be drained off and
1	right
1	cos that s the normal symptoms but my symptom actually was like yours was bleeding which again was confusing for everybody cos i had erm i had just come off hrt treatment
1	mm
1	and so i thought oh well maybe it s just erm you know residual normal menopausal
1	ah yeah
1	erm so you know i wasn t that concerned about it and i i had a cervical cancer trunc ch trunc screening test spoke to the nurse and said you know should i be worried about this she said oh well you know if it doesn t go away in a few weeks go back to the doctor
1	mm
1	and you know and it eventually you know you know i thought well it hasn t gone away so i will erm and to her credit she did yeah start with the kind of nuclear option first vocal desc laugh
1	right
1	but she might well not have done
1	yeah
1	and and and it and then coming back to the thing about what oncologists say to your a gp it was only much later on kind of right almost at the end of the cancer treatment that she she put something in the letter to the gp which suggested that it had actually gone into the fallopian tubes and it was because it was in the fallopian tubes that i got bleeding
1	oh right
1	but that was sort of lucky for me that it was
1	oh my word
1	cos otherwise cos i hadn t got any of this bloating
1	no
1	and i felt perfectly well you know i was i was tried to be very fit i went running every day swimming you know i was one of these kind of not a fitness fanatic but i did do exercise every day and i felt
1	mm
1	perfectly fine so you know vocal desc sigh it these cancers can be the result of unclear
1	yeah
1	but i think one other thing is you know if if a woman knows that one of the key indicators is just this blood test i mean often the doctor will be doing blood tests for other stuff i mean you know when you first went there and they did your thyroid test
1	yeah
1	they could actually have just ticked another box which
1	yeah
1	would have been
1	yeah
1	ca
1	yeah
1	and you might as well find this out
1	yeah
1	you know eighteen months earlier
1	yeah
1	so if if women know that that is trunc t trunc that test exists they could just say well look you know while we re about it why don t we just test that as well
1	yeah
1	you know and that could just be the thing that saves their lives because i know that that thing like seventy five percent of all women with ovarian cancer get diagnosed at stage c
1	mm
1	now what that means is that you know cancer is usually graded into four stages
1	yeah
1	one two three and four erm four is when it s really you know a a pretty tough call and it s gone
1	yeah
1	everywhere in your body
1	yeah
1	three is when it s spread somewhere else
1	yeah
1	erm so c is not fantastic but
1	no
1	the one of the one of the reasons why the cancer outcome statistics are not great for ovarian cancer is that everyone is found so late
1	i know
1	erm so you know it has spread by that by the time you get that bloating you know it it s spread
1	yeah
1	so there is no lump to feel so it s all so i think you know the message is pause dur short you know rather that your doctor might be a bit irritated and you just ask for the ca blood test which after all is not that as expensive for the nhs but
1	well i don t know you but is
1	not that that s a totally diagnostic device
1	no
1	i should say that you know not every ovarian cancer will be shown by that test and i think that s one of the reasons why a lot of these screening decisions are complicated
1	yeah
1	erm like you know if you just did that test it wouldn t necessarily pick up everything so that you know i think it s a very complicated area all this where
1	mm
1	unclear have to be very finely calibrated and
1	but i think they re not
1	indeed they are in breast i mean and breast cancer has been very controversial because you know an awful lot of women end up getting er breast surgery for things that might never had turned into cancer but you can t know one way or the other so it s
1	yeah
1	it you know it s always that balance and so i do respect the sort of academic process that that they use but sometimes i think you also have to be pragmatic and say well look the more women understand what kinds of cancer there are and what kind of cancers do not have obviously lumps that you can feel
1	yeah
1	and what kind of test it might be reasonable for them to ask for at least have the discussion with your doctor you know and you don t want to raise panic amongst people but at the same time you know there s a real issue of late diagnosis
1	yeah trunc abs trunc well absolutely i mean i i when i was twenty five i think i found a lump in my breast and it was quite a hard one and it wasn t it trunc ob trunc it wasn t a cyst it was erm turned out to be a fibroadenoma but i was in hospital having it removed within within the month and it was only recently that i thought oh my god they thought it was a cancer didn t they because otherwise i wouldn t have been whipped into hospital and had this lump removed
1	yeah
1	you know then er then and there erm but erm so erm i er the i at the time i suppose i was a bit bemused about why they d want to take it why they d want to take it out i don t think i ever stopped to think about why did they want to take it out but i m quite relieved they did
1	yeah
1	and and that i got that attention
1	do you think you were in denial at the time that unclear
1	no it just never crossed my mind no because actually what was vocal desc laugh really strange is that i think that there s probably a genetic component in my cancer because i think my grandmother had endometrial cancer
1	right
1	erm or possibly ovarian cancer erm years and years and years ago erm and but i had never it had never crossed my mind that i might get cancer because my mother goes around saying there isn t cancer in our family nobody in our family has got cancer erm never heard of anybody having cancer erm and so therefore i er i had kind of on some real subliminal level thought i m not i m not going to get cancer i m not gonna be prone to cancer i don t know why i would have swallowed that message whole it seemed to me that i suppose that there is some logic in that that if nobody in the family had ever had cancer then obviously there isn t a a kind of genetic component in our family like the bra gene or what
1	brca yeah
1	gene the brca gene whatever so erm i suppose i just had this sort of whole sense of security about it but
1	but unclear
1	actually an even falser because actually my grandmother almost certainly had erm a gynaecological cancer and i don t think she was ever even told that she did because and and when trunc wen trunc i said to my mother and my my trunc fa trunc it s my father s mother and i said to my father and my mother oh well of course nan had a hysterectomy and they said no she didn t and i said pause dur short she did and they said no she didn t and i said you know what i m pretty sure she did and they said no no we can t remember that spoke to my uncles who also said no i can t remember her having a a a hysterectomy and then and i said said not only did she have a hysterectomy but they treated her with with radium rods which were put into her vagina and she had to lie in bed for five days with radium rods in her vagina without moving and they said you ve made that up that s a load of old twaddle that never happened and i thought to myself do you know what i m so convinced it happened but they were convinced equally that it hadn t and the only way vocal desc laugh that it turned out that i was right in the end is because i ve got a diary of hers just happened to have a diary of hers for that year which talks about the whole process
1	wow
1	and until they saw their diary somehow it had gone right over their heads
1	so had they had they not been told or had they been told but just were in denial
1	i don t
1	or
1	absolutely don t know but i i
1	how unclear
1	really don t think they told her because
1	unclear
1	i think she she was kind of quite a nervy high strung person who was always a bit hypochondriac and she never sort of went round in her later life say oh well i wonder if it s cancer erm or i m really scared of having cancer again or something like when through all the symptoms she had when she was a ninety she did live till ninety three so obviously they caught it in time and they put it right but erm so there is hope at least vocal desc laugh
1	yeah yeah
1	but erm erm but erm i don t i don t think that they could ever have told her what what
1	what yeah
1	what it was
1	strange well i mean guess that s another whole issue isn t it about how people are told and
1	yeah
1	how much they re told and er you know how much one chooses to ask erm and the first thing i realised was that they said here s your macmillan nurse and i thought ah okay it s cancer then before they said the word cancer
1	yeah
1	erm that s how i knew it was trunc ca trunc
1	oh gosh and then so what happened you went you had you went for a scan
1	i well i had so yes i had er first of all i had an ultrasound scan
1	mm
1	and then erm they did that co test to corroborate it and at that point it was pretty the two of them so a lump and this raised level of co so that was pretty certain that it was and erm i mean it was i think that it was at that point that they introduced the macmillan nurse i m kind of trying to remember now exactly but erm and this was all it was a bit of a trunc h trunc horrendous thing because i was due to have go off with my choir on a tour which i had spent the year
1	oh no vocal desc laugh
1	organising so
1	yeah
1	i got this on a thursday and we were meant to be setting off with my choir on saturday er to my house in in france for a tour that anon nametype m type name and i had organised er and we had all the kind of venues booked and the tickets and you know everybody else it complicated holidays and booked around it so i said ah you know i i i need to go away next week and they said well look okay go away but you know it was meant to be a three week holiday erm but you know do your choir tour then and you must come back erm and so vocal desc laugh so it was a very strange choir tour i was sort of doing all this singing and thinking oh my goodness i m going back to so what i went back to then was a erm they do a ct biopsy a ct
1	uhu
1	guided biopsy so they put you under a ct scanner
1	mm
1	and they extract a tiny bit erm yeah of the tumour erm sort of guided by the ct scan so they can see where they re
1	yeah
1	getting it from erm and so that that came back erm and and another thing perhaps it s helpful to say is that when i got that er they said oh yes it s a very aggressive form of cancer and i think that can be a scary thing to hear but what
1	yeah
1	they said was that actually paradoxically erm aggressive cancers can be the ones that react best to chemotherapy because what a chemotherapy is doing is addressing rapidly dividing cells
1	yeah
1	so if you have a cancer that has rapidly dividing cells ie it s aggressive erm chemotherapy sometimes works better with those ones
1	oh right
1	than the ones that are slower burners and and i would see if i would be able able to tell that to another friend of mine who was just told it s an aggressive form of cancer without having that extra bit
1	yeah
1	so i mean to me that extra bit was really kind of vocal desc laugh the difference between it being awful news and it being
1	yeah
1	sort of here s the good news and here s the bad news sort of thing
1	yeah
1	so erm so that was kind of it s kind of a helpful thing for people to know i think
1	yeah
1	so erm yeah so that s how i got diagnosed and i i was very lucky that you know although it was still stage c you know if because i wasn t having any pain or symptoms you know if i had waited until i had got that i might well have been stage four and
1	yeah
1	incurable and erm er so mine had gone and rather unusually to my lymph nodes and when they first said it to me before the choir and told me that oh well it might be lymphoma or it might be ovarian cancer or it could be both
1	oh that s a
1	come back in a week vocal desc laugh
1	oh
1	so erm
1	scary
1	and so yeah erm but it it s nice to know that actually on the twenty ninth of november erm that that s the actual anniversary of me having the seven hours of surgery and being like in hospital for six weeks
1	oh what
1	with post trunc comp trunc you know post trunc op trunc er complications on that day this year one year on i shall be singing bach and handel and purcell in anon type place anon type place so that s just been
1	that s brilliant
1	like the most brilliant
1	cos that is brilliant
1	kind of
1	that is brilliant
1	life affirming omen really
1	yeah no i guess i m about yes er they operated on me in about mid november as well
1	so i mean going back to your your
1	but a couple of years further back
1	diagnosis and everything
1	mm
1	so is it you know do you wanna just say a little bit more about what endometrial trunc c trunc cancer is and
1	well erm i i suppose it s erm it s cancer of the lining of the womb so it s not necessarily in the wall of your womb it s in the lining so the first time i talked to the consultant about it i said well trunc perha trunc trunc y trunc you know perhaps it s like having woodworm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	you know and you ve got but you know you ve just got woodworm in the floorboards it hasn t got into the joists yet and it hasn t got into vocal desc laugh the walls and it hasn t got into the roof and he sort of said yes i suppose that you know i suppose that s a definition of stage one but you know actually it s just still contained in that
1	yeah
1	in that area and hasn t got out and spread and in fact mine had erm and that is a function of the fact that it wasn t diagnosed for eighteen months because erm in fact a friend of mine who had a hysterectomy because she d had a bad childbirth experience they sort of said oh you ve got stage one pause dur short er you know or you ve got precancerous cells inside your uterus erm pause dur short so but they didn t give her any treatment because it was still really really
1	no
1	localised erm so erm but mine i think that i had probably or things had probably made my life slightly more complicated because erm we had been trying for a baby and we were going to this clinic where we weren t having trunc i trunc we weren t actually having ivf but we were having kind of assisted conception and as part of that they injected some coloured fluid into my womb to see if there was a free flow of this and then they had trunc m trunc they trunc g trunc trunc d trunc did an ultrasound to see if the fluid kind of flowed up through my uterus and into my fallopian tubes and came out of the end of my fallopian tube
1	okay
1	to see if the reason i wasn t conceiving was because i had a blockage
1	right
1	and the eggs weren t travelling down my fallopian tube now in retrospect i think the reason why they then found little drifts of cancer cells up my fallopian tubes in one of my ovaries and down around the outside of the exterior of my uterus was because that process had sent cells
1	oh my god so they sort of flushed them round
1	i think they trunc s trunc i think that possibly they trunc star trunc yeah sort of endometrial cells had been flushed out of my or through my fallopian tubes and outside into my abdominal cavity
1	oh how terribly ironic
1	and then either they were cancerous at the time and it was a very very slow cancer and they just sat there quietly without giving me any symptoms for a couple of years or on the other hand they were ordinary cells and they were perfectly fine and then when something in my genes kind of clicked over and they decided that they were going to be cancerous they all started pause dur short playing pause dur short you know
1	yeah
1	cancerous little games all at once in their various little locations i m not sure which way round it was but erm pause dur short but you know i suppose it is i had had an ultrasound pause dur short erm when my periods started getting bad and when i started having pain and the the radiologist had said said oh don t worry you ve got fibroids pause dur short but there s nothing more sinister there well erm endometrial cancer doesn t show up as a tumour or a lump and so you don t have a tell tale lump as you would in breast cancer
1	no
1	erm and
1	or even in ovarian cancer actually
1	right
1	with ovarian cancer
1	yes i suppose you could have a localised lump
1	you you probably if you think of it
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	if you see see the lump
1	oh right
1	in erm when you have
1	yeah
1	have an ultrasound and you do feel the lump yeah
1	so now i find it a bit weird when i go back for checkups and they re sort of looking they sort of get down and look at assess my tummy to see if there s any sort of lumps and bumps on it and i think well there was never a lump in the first place vocal desc laugh i don t know would there be a lump now i m not sure whether there would be a lump now to this day
1	yeah
1	but but anyway but so there s no lumps to look at and there s no lumps to feel and actually if they send you for an ultrasound that doesn t tell you whether you ve got endometrial cancer because
1	yeah
1	actually if they can be just sitting there looking perfectly innocent when you scan them but pause dur short you know
1	yeah
1	they re not innocent at all
1	no so just to cut through that again so if if somebody had persistent bleeding
1	mm
1	er and they had some reason you know they might have some reason to check out trunc endomet trunc endometrial i can almost say it cancer the only way they would actually know that would be to scrape
1	yeah
1	the wall
1	yeah which is a kind of basic erm it s kind of like a d and c or the start of it trunc th trunc if you have a d and c they
1	yeah
1	kind of put a a hollow tube up your cervix well actually you probably have a they probably inject your cervix to dilate your cervix if you if you go for day surgery pause dur short and if you and actually have a miscarriage and they re trying to deal with the aftermath of a trunc mis trunc a miscarriage they ll put this tube up with a with a kind of implement into it into your womb and then just sort of go round and sort of scrape the lining so
1	right
1	if they re doing that to see if you ve got cancer cells up there it s just it s the work of what thirty seconds or something
1	oh really right
1	to get a to get a scrape as long as as long as
1	mm
1	you can cope with the the pause dur short i i wouldn t say it was pain i don t know it s pause dur short i wouldn t say it was pain so much as a kind of pause dur short i don t know i suppose there s somebody sort of pause dur short stuck their thumb in you really hard pause dur short you know it s that kind of pain it s a kind of vocal desc misc sort of pain
1	yeah
1	but not a sharp kind of cutting of a knife sort of pain
1	okay
1	so but i think erm pause dur short they er a lot of a lot of women find that too trunc discom trunc too uncomfortable
1	yeah
1	i mean actually if you
1	well it s a very difficult one to diagnose though
1	yeah
1	endometrial
1	well if you ve had erm if you ve had a coil
1	yeah
1	it s easier cos you ve had that before so you d know exactly what you re in for in terms of discomfort cos
1	yeah
1	they have to in the same way that they put a trunc coi trunc they put a hollow tube through your cervix and then they pop the coil through the tube
1	yeah
1	and then it pops out and opens up like an umbrella inside you so pause dur short if you ve had that you wouldn t you wouldn t have the problem with
1	yeah
1	having a scrape really
1	okay but it s it s a more tricky one to find then cos there s not even a lump if you re having an ultrasound
1	no
1	like you would still have this co
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	which would indicate
1	yeah
1	but if you had raised co but no lump through an ultrasound then you should be saying could it be this
1	yeah yeah
1	to your doctor
1	yeah
1	and asking for that scrape
1	yeah
1	okay
1	and you can have a local and you can have a pause dur short and you can have a general i mean and
1	yeah
1	you know if they in fact actually
1	did you just have a local anaesthetic
1	no no just
1	just doing it
1	did it then and there and went from there was the the registrar
1	you didn t have any unclear at all
1	no no they just said
1	unclear
1	hop up here and this might hurt and vocal desc laugh and then you know within five minutes it was all done and dusted and got sent away and then you know a week later as i said they called me back to hospital i have to say the way he told me was absolutely appalling
1	oh really
1	there was this this consultant i d never seen before who got wheeled into the room and there was a student who was obviously there to hear how to tell a patient they ve got cancer there was a registrar who obviously was just they were just the gynae the gynae guy so mostly they were dealing with pregnancies and miscarriages and stuff and not with cancer so they were all beside themselves and didn t know what to do about it and didn t know what to say so they just told me and then we all just stared at each other vocal desc laugh and then i had to go away for a month and wait for them to tell me how bad it was
1	a month why
1	er because it took a month for the results to come back
1	oh my goodness
1	cos the i had to go for a ct scan and then an mri scan and whatever before before they erm you know sort of decided they trunc s trunc as i said they you know it could have been just the equivalent of woodworm in the floorboards
1	gosh that must must have been agonisingly worrying having that long wait i mean i as for me i mean the first pause dur short the the equivalent i had i suppose of er erm when i first saw the oncologist cos erm they kind of had a whole team of people saying would i like to be involved in research but it was like there there seemed to be a room full of people there must have been some were
1	vocal desc laugh
1	shadowing the oncologist and there was lots of people from the research project and there was the macmillan nurse and i can t even remember there were quite a lot of people and me and the oncologist who i ve never met before and she started off with
1	and were you on your own
1	i was that day actually i don t know
1	oh no
1	quite why
1	oh god
1	anyway erm erm she said well look erm one third of people die straightaway er one third of people erm die kind sort of in the treatment somehow and a third of people get well five years running and it it was like my god you know it was like really desperately awful
1	that is brutal
1	and it and she just came out with that in front of all these people that i didn t know at all
1	god that s brutal
1	and and vocal desc laugh and i thought oh great you know thanks you know erm so if one trunc thir trunc i think the the correct statistic is one third of people die straightaway
1	does that sort of that echo in your brain
1	oh god yeah you know one third of people erm pause dur short die within five years and one third of people last beyond or something like that so it s it s er you know it s kind of two thirds of them die before the you know
1	oh
1	five years but it s you know awful statistics and and erm and of course you have to you know when you when you will have that you do have to do a bit of reality check that actually all this data doesn t relate to you know the past and how things were and it probably is improving all the time erm and you know the sort of there are other factors in that
1	yeah
1	like the age of the person
1	yeah
1	how fit they were and what unclear but anyway
1	and my husband trunc th trunc
1	so so being told that
1	yeah
1	was the like in trunc whe trunc when i then had to keep it together because that was the meeting in which they were gonna explain whether or not i should do this research and
1	vocal desc misc
1	and erm and
1	vocal desc misc
1	trunc ye trunc and i was trying to take in all the details of the research project and the treatment options and you know once i d heard that i didn t really get much further than oh my god i m gonna be dead
1	vocal desc misc no well quite what else did you hear i mean
1	vocal desc laugh
1	i can t er i can t understand what else you would hear even after that had been said to you i mean i just i trunc p trunc i put my head very very firmly in the sand anon nametype m type name said to me the statistics are irrelevant actually cos you are not a statistic and the statistics no matter what the statistics say that doesn t necessarily affect you
1	yeah
1	so erm
1	but of course everyone will say that
1	yeah
1	and you you kind of
1	yeah
1	erm the i mean i think i think there s a kind of pragmatic middle way between
1	yeah
1	sort of erm of being aware of the statistics but at the same time you know not getting completely bogged down in them cos you know
1	yeah
1	er every person is unique and everybody but every journey is unique and some people who have stage four go on to live and some people who are stage one go on to die and you know so you can t
1	yeah
1	but unclear
1	yeah
1	you know once you ve heard then you can t un hear
1	no no i mean it makes a lot of difference that where if you know there are staging significant and the aggressiveness is is significant obviously i mean mine because mine had left my erm womb and had got out it was stage three and i realised it was stage three when i saw the consultant anon nametype m type name the surgeon i saw him write stage three upside down on his notes
1	right
1	so erm so and i just thought oh pause dur short i oh erm you know because i had been hoping and hoping that up to that point that they would say look you know it s just confined it s fine but it had got out and got round a bit but not into my lymph glands so
1	yeah
1	but you know er vocal desc sigh i didn t know what to do about my doctor afterwards because i just thought you know what a few months more and it would have been in my lymph glands and it would have been you know proportionately hugely more serious erm and so it took me a long time to get over being angry with her i was just so livid with her for such a long period of time
1	yeah
1	erm and i just thought you careless bloody woman vocal desc laugh
1	yeah yeah
1	erm and you know especially when she had kept you know i was just on the verge of just not talking about it anymore and also the other thing i think that s quite important is that my mother had really bad really bad periods before she had her menopause the process of her menopause was was appalling i mean she had appalling bleeding she had terrible pain she had flooding you know it was you know she had a terrible time and other women i know have had a really bad time through menopause so when i felt i was having a bad time i just thought you know what that s what women go through and it s menopause and you read stuff about menopause and you hear erm you know stories about people you re not you know you can t go anywhere and you can t do anything cos you re just bleeding all the time all over the place and and i just sort of thought well i m in the bound of a normality and you know other women have had have had just this sort of thing and it s just been kind of normal
1	yeah
1	for their age and and so erm and so i i kept thinking to myself you know do i complain about it perhaps i shouldn t complain about it perhaps you know the doctor s sort of thing oh yeah yeah you and a thousand others yeah yeah
1	yeah yeah yeah yeah
1	get over it sort of thing erm pause dur short so i i don t know whether you know you i i mean once when i had a miscarriage and i we went to erm a and e and i overheard one young doctor saying to another young doctor well you know they always exaggerate how much they ve been bleeding and it s not you know ever as bad as they say it is you know and you d sort of think oh well you know okay blood makes a mess doesn t it so you know a a tablespoon of blood is actually quite a lot of blood
1	yeah
1	to clear up you know and it makes quite a big splash as it were erm but you know so i kept thinking to myself perhaps i m perhaps i m overreacting perhaps you know
1	yeah
1	this really is within the bounds of normality and i shouldn t be whinging so much about it
1	yeah yeah i think i think a lot of people are put off
1	yeah
1	going to their gp for that especially as we know how busy gps are and
1	yes
1	you know you can see they re under great pressure and
1	yeah
1	and erm you know er and we re all er unsure and so on i mean i suppose i all i can say is i think that educating people about symptoms
1	yeah
1	and just being aware that you can just try to sort of you know get some reality checks for yourself as to
1	yeah
1	whether things you know if things go on and on being being wrong
1	yes
1	erm and if they follow you know a pattern that you ve read about you know then you shouldn t feel it s unreasonable to take their time i mean it s a perfectly reasonable thing to to say you know
1	yeah
1	it it it isn t a and to persist if you don t feel well like i said there s the like the thyroid thing which you know was a perfectly reasonable trunc in trunc you know intervention because of the fact that you did have a thyroid problem
1	yeah
1	so it wasn t an unreasonable
1	no no no
1	intervention
1	no no that you got but you know to just have that confidence that that you know just cos you ve got one thing that s been diagnosed correctly doesn t mean you might not have another parallel set of
1	absolutely
1	that has been missed
1	yeah
1	you know so just to have that confidence to to pursue it with your with your gp
1	but to this day i couldn t tell you what the symptoms of vulvas of cancer of the vulva were or cancer of the vagina i have i have and i trunc d trunc almost don t dare dare to look them up really i mean the
1	yeah
1	you know erm cervical cancer erm well we have smears so we don t have to worry so we have smears so that s fine breast cancer we know about erm you are supposed to examine your breasts but the other ones they are just they really are hidden aren t they they re
1	yeah
1	so hidden
1	they are absolutely hidden yeah
1	and actually i mean the other thing as well that erm there was another survey which was done by the ovarian cancer action about outcomes for women after having gynaecological cancers in terms of the continuation of their sex lives and erm there was something on woman s hour about it erm last year and erm and and actually when blokes have prostate cancer a lot of attention is paid to their continuance of their erectile function and whether they you know are incontinent and stuff like this erm but you know there s people talk about their libido and you know their sex lives and and it s actively part of their treatment to talk about this and to counsel men about this but there isn t
1	no
1	in parallel er conversations with women about the more trunc gen trunc the general issue about how a do you are you are are you a real woman if you haven t got your bits anymore do you still feel attractive as a woman of a certain age and you re kind of you know you re not attracting attention from men anymore perhaps your looks are going off or whatever you ve certainly got physical problems of various kinds erm and now actually you ve had surgery so you feel kind of maimed in
1	well you are maimed
1	a way you are maimed by the surgery
1	yeah
1	erm and so you are you know in one in one respect of being a woman redundant erm and then actually because you haven t got the hormones anymore there are all kinds of difficult consequences of not having oestrogen in your body erm and then what s more your sex life goes up the spout because vocal desc laugh you know erm because of all those previous factors including the fact that you haven t got oestrogen and progesterone anymore erm and so you know trunc y trunc just do people talk to us about this no they bloody don t actually
1	no they don t they don t erm
1	is that a boy coming in for unclear for his tea unclear
1	it s isn t a boy
1	oh right
1	erm erm
1	oh we ve
1	well how many unclear
1	we ve got six five minutes to go before we before we ve done the hour so if we could just do
1	okay
1	five minutes more and then
1	okay erm yeah i mean i think that is a huge issue and i suppose i think a lot of people feel they ve just got to be so grateful that they re here on the planet
1	yeah
1	at all
1	yeah
1	that all those other things just kind of you know they can t whine about those things because they re just quite glad that they re here at all
1	yeah
1	on the planet and so unless but i kind of do somewhat feel that erm
1	but then on the other hand you see
1	but but but
1	i my husband s younger than me he s only in his forties and even if for myself i thought well you know well you know vocal desc sigh you know i can cope i mean i can t i can t say to my husband that s that s the end of the line for him and he s not even hit fifty yet
1	no no no but that i i think that i i i think the point of raising the point about it not being talked about is an important point and i think it s a
1	yeah
1	really hard point erm the er i mean there must be that kind of yeah it s something i totally struggled with i mean i ve basically struggled with it because i also did ivf before unsuccessfully and so for myself from that point wasn t really a real woman
1	mm
1	before i even got this erm and now i ve got this and i ve got a fucking great scar right through my pubic area right up to my breast bone you know and it it s not attractive it just is not vocal desc laugh you know and erm and i think that is very hard yeah er er so i don t have any sort of easy thing to say about it other than to say yes i think it s probably is something we probably should give women the opportunity to talk about
1	perhaps we need trunc th trunc but did you have when you were young cos i think we re kind of more or less the same age did you ever have a copy of our bodies ourselves
1	er no
1	didn t you it was the most amazing american publication i think by a trunc f trunc an american feminist and in fact actually vocal desc laugh in a way it was really bad news to me because they had a real thing about women trunc giv trunc being given hysterectomies for no good reason and how it s men wanting to kind of cut of women s bits because they were jealous of them et cetera so they were like really hysterically against people having erm hysterectomies and so on the basis of this i turned down the opportunity of explore having a hysterectomy vocal desc laugh for quite for a while during all of this process but but the one thing it did do it had diagrams of your body names for all the bits an analysis of the kind of the things that women get plus the symptoms plus kind of conversations with women about how they felt about these things plus you know kind of quite intimate things about sex and bodies and stuff like that and it was a great big tome and they did and it was sort of published in the seventies and it was kind of quite a radical piece of pro really erm possibly reading back on it not as medically informed or sensible as it as it might have been but on the other hand you know a real good medical handbook for women s problems
1	yeah
1	which i did get an updated version of many years later but i wonder if there s you know might even be a role for kind of republishing it or
1	yeah
1	reimagining it with with this kind of information in it for women so not just about
1	interesting cos your age there must be all kinds of interesting ways that you could do that actually
1	yeah and i mean i read when i was having when i started getting well when my periods started getting peculiar i bought a book called is it the perimenopause which is a book all about what symptoms you would get you know in the years leading up to menopause erm which was actually very useful but then described as being normal symptoms of menopause some of some of the symptoms i was having they re cos i ve got cancer you know so therefore
1	yeah
1	again you know erm i wasn t getting the full picture and i probably wasn t as alarmed as i should have been and i wasn t as aeriated as i should have been and i wasn t as insistent with my doctor as i should have been cos i thought oh this is still par for the course
1	yeah yeah
1	it s what you get when you re fifty you know and you know what what again coming back to your point what is normal what is abnormal if you ve got a symptom how long should you leave it
1	yeah
1	before you go to and say to somebody this is not right
1	yeah yeah
1	so oh god it does make you right i mean it makes me frightened in
1	you can probably
1	retrospect actually
1	end this conversation by
1	yeah
1	just saying that kind of on a more upbeat note
1	yeah
1	at the moment both of us are in remission
1	yeah
1	and erm you know and i suppose the other kind of big message i have erm for the nhs is that or one of the most important things is radical surgery and having erm the opportunity to have that
1	yeah
1	and one of the most poignant stories that i have heard is that a person i know who who was given erm an operative trunc sur trunc an operative slot of two and a half hours and she was taken down to surgery and they had they had only had two and a half hours and there was still cancer left inside her and they were obliged to sew her back up again leaving it there and
1	oh
1	er whereas as i and this you know er and i am just appalled that that was done to her
1	yeah
1	er whereas i had seven hours of exploratory surgery and they just went at it just as long as it
1	yeah
1	took them to take everything out and
1	yeah
1	unclear to empty the unclear lymph nodes and you know that that is the single most important bit of treatment
1	yeah
1	all the chemotherapy is is really precautionary to
1	yeah
1	wash up any other cells that might be hanging around but
1	yeah
1	the treatment is the surgery
1	yeah
1	and and and you
1	if it offends me pluck it out vocal desc laugh
1	you yeah exactly and and i think that you know er how ridiculously short sighted of the nhs to trunc tr trunc to to compromise on that because all that happened to that woman is she then obviously came back
1	yeah
1	you know cos it then recurred and now she s you know having this i think this er the drug avastin which is considered unclear
1	oh
1	and you know and if if they d actually done the surgery properly in the first place
1	yeah
1	you know that would have been more effective it would have saved her life and it would have saved
1	yeah
1	them a great deal of time and energy and money and
1	yeah
1	you know so i mean i m a very passionate believer that you know erm women have a you know a a right to have this and it trunc rad trunc more radical surgery
1	yeah
1	and one of the reasons why these figures have actually improved somewhat on ovarian cancer is that they ve you know they do now try this much more radical approach to
1	yeah
1	to the surgery to get everything out whereas before they did routinely leave little bits in and it only one cell
1	oh yeah no
1	it it will go back again and you think well why on earth
1	yeah absolutely
1	did they ever leave a little bit in there it was seems mad really
1	well perhaps yeah perhaps there s a part
1	perhaps they were very difficult to get hold of and maybe they just didn t have the surgical skills i m not sure but i mean that s a really important message that you know
1	yeah
1	to to know that actually you you know you er it s really important that the nhs does give that investment
1	yeah
1	to women
1	and perhaps unclear
1	in the surgery in the first round and then maybe you ve cleared it
1	yeah
1	you know if you re lucky maybe you have you know
1	and perhaps women need to face up to the fact that perhaps they will need a hysterectomy and that it might be the norm to have a hysterectomy in the end and actually in a lot of ways i m really glad it s all gone really am glad
1	yeah
1	i mean i never got on with it for the whole of my life anyway particularly
1	mm so am i
1	it was always on a different page to me so actually the fact that it s gone and it s all been whipped away is like wahey you know
1	yeah well i mean it s funny how
1	relief
1	your attitude changes cos er erm my sister s been delightfully put that anon nametype f type name you unclear in the pelvic area
1	vocal desc laugh
1	vocal desc laugh and erm
1	vocal desc laugh
1	and i ve thought you know i thought kind of that er when i got the menopause it would be some awful rite of passage cos i d had ivf unsuccessfully you know and blah blah blah but i actually when i did get to that point i thought well you know i i ve got beyond all that i m not going to you know i did adopt a trunc ba trunc a baby so i was lucky and that has been hugely fulfilling and so you know that s what i did instead and
1	yeah
1	there are other ways of getting a child and erm erm so then you know i ve built it up in my mind as being you know it would be this enormous like you know psychological thing but actually do you know it wasn t
1	no
1	and and similarly to you i think you know actually erm because i wasn t going to have a baby at this point anyhow
1	yeah
1	you know i i don t feel especially you sort of sentimental about all these bits i feel god if well if that s my ticket to life get on with it and take it out
1	yeah yeah
1	just get rid it
1	get it put it in the bin
1	you know and er put it in the bin
1	yeah
1	and so erm you know i think i didn t feel sentimental about these bits i think you know er when it comes to life or death you know there s no unclear you ve just gotta go for life
1	oh yeah absolutely gosh that
0	so how much is that in money twenty
0	only disregard all the extra minutes there s only about three minutes

0	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short that s who anon nametype m type name reminds me of anon nametype m type name
0	do you know strangely enough he was like the first person that i ever loved off the screen and erm it wasn t very long after i d been with anon nametype m type name that i clicked and i said that s who he reminds me of pause dur short this is why i watched it
0	so they say you don t have a type but clearly i do
0	oh
0	do you know what else i love ten things i hate about you
0	oh it s a classic
0	mm
0	which i appreciate
0	all of those films
0	i learnt myself i taught myself how to do the dance
0	yep pause dur short cool intentions
0	really
0	mm
0	powerful and so extreme like i would say i blush now but then a boy i had a crush on a boy called anon nametype m type name for six and a half years
0	yeah
0	that s a tip
0	just i went swimming twice a week pause dur short ate salads that just
0	mm
0	erm and it was like a swoon moment you know like in one of those teen films and it was like oh and then i was then i had him and his best friend fighting over me and i was like ooh ooh ooh
0	then we went into sixth form and they all stayed friends with me and then there was three of them all at it as well and i used to unclear games teacher and they they were all taking me out for drinks
0	mm
0	mm
0	approached by attractive blokes in clubs and if you think about all the the boys that you ve had interest from they ve all been attractive pause dur short like you can t really think that you re not attractive
0	mm
0	like you know just for that pause dur short i mean people i don t even care and he probably doesn t they probably don t even remember saying it
0	you know the stuff that you get called when you re at school like that s why i would never go back to school ever ever pause dur short you know if i if i could have my time again i would never go back because those last two years were so painful pause dur short but i think everybody experiences some level of torment at some point and i i think there s very few people who don t pause dur short but erm i the stuff that kids used to say to me will never factor in their mind so they would never look back and think god
0	which is really it s i mean that s when you learn that s not acceptable behaviour but you re in all likelihood you re not in contact with those people anymore so you can t really make amends pause dur short it s like my name is isn t it it goes back and makes unclear it s always done and i quite like that idea like you learn that that s not really acceptable behaviour
0	do you know even if i really think hard i can t remember many girls that i was nasty about pause dur short i can t really think of any pause dur short i remember saying anon nametype f type name looked like a man but she was going to unclear so i think that kind of counts

0	yeah i feel a bit sick now pause dur short i ve been sick into my face
0	he is hot though whoever he is
0	yeah
0	your boobs have shrunk
0	early twenties i think pause dur short i think she s probably got good skin to be older than you would think
0	he really hasn t aged much at all
0	oh there s pause dur short i didn t realise that bit of drama which the last time pause dur short if you re the dad you re not going to let your stepson hit on your daughter are you
0	of his ex wife right
0	yeah
0	oh
0	do you know actually that s really just reminded me i was in year four i think when this came out pause dur short thirty five three years six yeah year four in school and my friend anon nametype f type name best friend anon nametype f type name at the time brought a magazine into work er into school that had the lingo from this and the translation like
0	really
0	learning it yeah pause dur short who the hell we thought we were gonna talk to i don t know
0	mm mm awkward
0	she s so sweet
0	she s absolutely adorable
0	i remember it so well like i watched it last week
0	how what say again
0	i recall like when we were in sixth form that everyone and anyone turned eighteen they d have parties at the local rugby club they would hire it out pause dur short and everyone did it every eighteenth birthday so every other week there was one erm and it was quite normal pause dur short i remember having a conversation with my friend how many people have you trunc snog trunc snogged tonight and my reply was seven
0	right okay pause dur short trunc th trunc that was never at school i was never like that i was always a shrinking violet pause dur short when i turned eighteen and i went to uni it all changed and when i was that age i think because school was a like really hard and i used to get really picked on then i was i just became more and more introverted so that was never i was never that girl growing up never ever pause dur short but as i got a bit older and when i was at college and i started working and i was meeting new people so i d moved to a different pause dur short i d gone to a different college not my sixth form college and met new people there and i trunc wor trunc i started working at the bakery in town so i met new people there which is where i met will my last ex way back when and my best friend at the time anon nametype f type name pause dur short and we used to go out drinking all the time and i had no confidence whatsoever er and it i think even now that this had a quite long lasting effect because i don t think i have much confidence now pause dur short but certainly then i would never i would never have approached anybody and i was always frightened if somebody approached me and in fact i am now pause dur short because there s i could probably count on one hand the amount of times that i ve liked somebody and they ve liked me back because it s quite a rare a rare event actually pause dur short like to like somebody from afar and then to actually succeed and get them i could trunc ne trunc it never really happened pause dur short and i don t know if that s a confidence thing or what it is but i mean i
0	no pause dur short no pause dur short because if you were to just look at the two of us like i m more i always look a mess my hair is always mental my trunc fa trunc i never wear any make up and i wear running clothes
0	except i don t see myself as
0	if i
0	but but the thing is at the one the very few few times you ve been questioning me on this i think well i ve been me for my whole life pause dur short like i know what what sort of reaction i get from people and like if we walk through town and nobody blinks an eye like do you know what i mean like you re not turning heads and some people are meant to and some people aren t and that s fine pause dur short i just sort of find
0	no
0	yeah pause dur short honestly i promise you pause dur short i just don t think you see it at all
0	like if i pause dur short i walked into work once without make up and i d only gone there quickly to drop my bag sneak in the office drop my bag and go to the gym pause dur short and eve went oh my god are you okay vocal desc laugh i went what and then i realised that s like yes fine this is what i look like without make up on and she was like vocal desc laugh her face was mortified that she d offended me
0	oh
0	have you just chopped your leg in half
0	whereas if i put more make up on to go out really i risk looking like a drag queen
0	it seems unlikely
0	because she s flustered but i think basically she s just put blusher on that much
0	you re a fricking genius pause dur short it must have just come to you in a dream
0	are you dying that s probably the most food you ve had in a very long time
0	i was lathering it all on and it s unclear

0	that is fake tan on that face
0	you can tell it s fake tan
0	orange face so pause dur short i mean he s got quite a nice face apart from that he looks a bit of a psycho in that one
0	they re screaming pause dur short oh god
0	who s pause dur short dad just had a lovely homemade king prawn balti
0	my dad
0	no he can t have pause dur short you didn t make it homemade though did you i m gonna put

0	he was in nine zero two one zero unclear
0	literally you d shit your pants

0	yeah
0	at all
0	it s a fine line isn t it
0	yeah and like with my dad my dad s really proud and and my older brother is pretty well off financially because obviously like he bought my dad a a super deluxe lovely tv for christmas and never comes to visit us but that s they don t pause dur short but but i know that my my dad wants to be the one to pay for dinner he wants to be able to get the drinks but actually you know he he s retired and michael s got quite a good income it should be michael that pays pause dur short just as you know it would be me that would do it pause dur short but i think it s different because i live here so i sort of take it all for granted
0	yeah
0	yeah definitely
0	but i suppose because they see each other less frequently
0	okay
0	so i paid for it erm and gave it to the guy at the counter and dad was stood there and i said do you want to take your coffees over and i ll wait for the third one and he said oh no it s okay and the guy came over because i d distracted dad i was quick enough to give him the forty pound cash for a thirty nine pound bill that unclear
0	erm and he said what are you doing and i said i m paying for the dinner and he said well no cos i ll pay for dinner pause dur short and i said no stop it because you always pay for everything and i just want to pay for one thing pause dur short knowing that i was actually really paying for it
0	mm

0	even if even something that he he that i was going to pay for myself because i ve had the cash for
0	yeah
0	god
0	he still wanted
0	bad
0	to provide for you
0	that part where he s i ve given him every single excuse for him to be able to just say okay then i ll let you on this occasion he still won t do it pause dur short and i said to him dad i said you re going to have to get over this you know because i wouldn t take the money off him and he put in my bag and on the bed pause dur short i said what are you doing i said no i said i wanted to pay for it pause dur short and he said and he got unclear and i put it in my bag and i said thank you i said but you re you re going to have to get over this you know i said because you know you come down here and you pay for petrol to get here you pay

1	well i m pause dur short i m quite keen to go on this open farm day erm and er pause dur short and er was it anon type place it s about an hour away erm there is another farm about four miles away from the big tomato growing place it s open at four o clock so i might go pause dur short they open at ten eleven o clock it closes at four o clock
1	mm pause dur short oh okay pause dur short i thought four was a bit late to start i thought they might be doing cows or something different with that
1	erm well no no this is just tomatoes tomatoes this place you know it s a huge
1	the tomato place is ten to four
1	yeah and the main farms trunc ar trunc unclear open at unclear eleven no eleven to four and the main farm from eleven to five so there is another one an arable farm about four miles to go if we wanted to go to that now how does that hang with you
1	mm pause dur short well i d like to come but
1	i knew there would be a but in there
1	well pause dur short i would like to come very much i mean i ve always wanted to get into anon type place and i think it s broadly similar
1	oh yeah
1	but vocal desc sigh if i do that i m putting myself under a heck of a lot of pressure and you might be able to do it but i m not sure how much turn of speed i know i ve got more energy than i ve had but i just don t know if i can do it and i m sorry not to come to keep you company and i m sorry for me because i m missing out on something i want to do and i thought yesterday was a bit of a bummer of a day i managed to get some things done in the end but i couldn t really energise myself and having not slept very well last night i m a bit concerned i might flake out when i get back
1	right okay
1	how do you feel about going on your own
1	well that s alright what i might do is i m fairly certain she s not interested in going i might ring up anon nametype f type name because she s the great horticulturist so
1	she was a bit dismissive about going to a farm wasn t she
1	she was yes yes so that might trunc i trunc i ll give her the option the other thing i ve got to do today erm i ve got to do this erm chasing of all these people on the heidelberg trip but i m gonna ring the guy who is normally the organiser anon nametype n type name and erm see if he s got the contact details for this rather mysterious italian lady that s came with us the one where all my emails are bouncing because i m obviously i m not spelling her name right but if i do that i can send her the email but then this evening i m gonna ring them all and see if they are interested and i might get a bit trunc sna trunc snappy because
1	oh yes pause dur short well it would be useful if they know if they want to or not i mean you are not saying they have to you just want to know don t you i mean there s not there s not a wrong decision there s not a wrong answer it s just not having a decision is awkward
1	yeah pause dur short that s right pause dur short yes as far a pause dur short yeah
1	have you given up on your group discounts
1	yeah i do i contacted european rail and the group discount was not a you can t save any money you marginally save something on eurostar but nothing on german railways in fact i ve got a cheaper fare on german railways going by a different route than they seem to be get be able to get
1	oh okay pause dur short so what way do you think you re going now
1	well this will be down to london eurostar to paris across paris well cross it s only a few hundred yards
1	oh which stations
1	you come into paris nord and go out of paris est and they are only a few hundred yards apart apparently according to our sources
1	nord pause dur short nord pause dur long oh because the first time i went to paris i had never well i had mastered the london underground pause dur short but i thought oh i don t know if i could manage doing it so i got a map because i i understand maps and roads even if i don t understand metros
1	well i ve got maps of paris
1	and i trunc w trunc i and my then boyfriend walked across and i suppose we had luggage but whichever one we went to i think we went to anon type place is there a anon type place
1	anon type place yeah
1	because we were going down to anon type place which is in the south it s in the middle
1	but fine yeah
1	and it seemed quite a long walk but i mean it was a doable walk because i had
1	no trunc the trunc these people reckon it s literally three or four hundred yards unclear
1	are you thinking of a wheelie case
1	oh yeah i ll be taking a wheelie case trunc eve trunc even if it s only the small one but erm but the the the issue about that is there s a formal reception i will have to take at least one set of smart clothes you know
1	mm
1	erm pause dur short so that s that s sort of today pause dur short what are you doing tomorrow
1	tomorrow well that rather trunc depen trunc everything i haven t done today basically
1	vocal desc laugh
1	erm what i think i might do today you re promising me sunshine aren t you
1	well that s what the weather forecast yesterday says i ll check it in a few minutes
1	it s quite early yet it might it might erm
1	yeah it said by the middle of the day it was going to be twenty two degrees
1	well it was pretty warm by yesterday evening i mean warm for an evening
1	but brilliant sun as well the sky is still quite grey
1	yeah pause dur short erm pause dur short if i can pause dur short i want to finish a bit of admin here pause dur short which i just won t do for very long and i thought between about ten and two i might try and go to anon type place
1	uhu
1	including travelling
1	right i m
1	and then come back and do some more admin and if i can do any paperwork tidying up all to the good with a view to doing my washing in the late afternoon so to be out of your washing arena and then tomorrow set aside the whole day with thinking through what i need to take where and any extra time i get i can go i can continue filling up that recycling box i m not short of things to do but i fear there may not be other time and i may have to pause that activity that s oh erm i might like to go to the the library as well tomorrow my only thoughts on the library tomorrow is that one of my books on its third renewal is erm pause dur short due back on the twenty first so something has to happen and what i thought i might do is if i can take the book in check it in and then if no one wants it i ll check it out again if if i don t manage to do that are you au fait with that technique
1	mm pause dur short right pause dur short check it out again yeah okay pause dur short oh yeah pause dur short oh just
1	i ll tell you the other thing that s really important that might take a bit of time is i ought to write to anon type place hospital about my pain clinic appointments but i ve got to get my head in the right space to do that because i don t want to become across as erm ms angry of anon type place
1	mm pause dur short right on monday i m i ve got the trunc poe trunc i m trunc run trunc i m doing poetry so that will be finished at that ll be finished at half eleven so what i could do is come from there then come to anon type place if that s useful right it ll have to be it ll be indirect because i ll have to come via the park and ride because i m going in on the park and ride but that s possible
1	mm pause dur short well er the only thing i could mention is depending on what the weather is like a you don t want it too hot but you don t want it torrential storms you ve got those tomatoes
1	tomatoes to put in yeah i don t want to leave them particularly in the car all the morning while i m at poetry so you could if i packaged them you could take them in yeah
1	what only if i go over on monday
1	yeah yeah if you don t go on monday unclear i will come back here pick them up and take them over because i need to get shot of them effectively because they ll need one or two days of tlc while they are over there to bed in with lots of slug pellets vocal desc laugh
1	yes pause dur short i m afraid there s lots of
1	knowing your knowing your population of snails
1	if you ever need them when they are over there do you know where to find them
1	have you got some over there
1	yes
1	oh i didn t know you had
1	erm if you go into my utility room and look on the shelves there s erm it s like an ice not an ice cream container erm the one that has the trunc pow trunc cleaning powder in it it s got a label on that says slug pellets but just to give you an idea of what shape and it s if you stand up it s about there
1	yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short oh right pause dur short so just above head height
1	yeah
1	right
1	i think it s on the shelf above where i keep the keys
1	right tuesday erm when have i got to get you to the station
1	yeah pause dur short erm we wrote in the diary the other day nine forty
1	leaving here at nine forty right okay
1	because because earlier is better for you because then you you you need to drop me off and i had a little thought about that actually because erm we can go to the disabled car park and put use my blue badge and then you could walk me we could or we could
1	well that s that s not a problem pause dur short mm pause dur short ah but you might need your blue badge in anon type place
1	yes and trunc th trunc then could you drive round if i wait outside the station could you drive round and drop off the
1	badge yeah that s possible
1	otherwise i did check the front of the station and there are some dropping off spaces we could try for one of those but as a fall back option possibly do that oh you know we were talking about libraries
1	yeah yeah i know where they are pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah i m not under so much pressure from that don t forget because the venue has been of the exam has been moved to anon type place rather than being in anon type place
1	oh right oh well pause dur short you could drop me off at twenty past one then couldn t you
1	i could do yeah it s not a problem
1	erm i think you might want some lunch so that s what we tried to trunc fact trunc factor in
1	oh that s not a problem i can dance around that whatever
1	oh you could go to the erm sandwich shop for old times sake
1	yeah vocal desc laugh i don t think that one s open anymore is it
1	i don t know
1	i think i think the blue one is open but the old one is not open i don t think
1	erm pause dur long if you go to anon type place tomorrow i d like you to register my new prescription card at the chemist because if i go to anon type place with my prescription he i mean they they know of me they know of me and they just say don t worry about it but they are a bit funny in well they re a bit more particular i mean they are probably more correct because they ve got this electronic system and things but i mean that mr anon nametype n type name is very nice
1	mm pause dur short yeah that s not a problem pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short well i ve i ve got plenty of time on monday afternoon in principle
1	yeah and that would enable me to have the card registered there erm in case because it s always useful i don t know what they d trunc s trunc you you don t want to be there and them say go away you haven t got your card i don t know they would but
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short you are avoiding the possibility of that
1	the thing i wanted to tell you that came through on my anon type place library news which i think is a bit shocking erm because i always say how great our library service is one of the features i very much like has gone free trunc res trunc reservations
1	oh are they going to start charging
1	a quid
1	yeah that s what they used to charge years ago
1	yes erm but i thought the free reservations were the pay off for not giving us a choice of very much choice of library books and they said in order to maintain services we have to charge you a pound it wasn t just targeted at me saying because you have been overusing the service erm you can have trunc fir trunc i mean i i think it would be very encouraging to say you can you can have your first fifty a year free or i don t know how many books should you read in a year
1	mm pause dur short mm pause dur short vocal desc laugh pause dur short ten for the price of five pause dur short yeah pause dur short and that s too difficult programming into the system
1	well i don t know but trying to collect pounds off everybody when you do things online it presumably isn t simple
1	well no it just goes onto your account the same as your erm overdue charges doesn t it if a book goes overdue you can log it in and it says you owe them money but you don t have to pay it then you can carry on taking books in and out but at some stage it starts blocking you and says give us the money and i m sure that s how it will work because it s just an extension of that system then isn t it
1	right pause dur short mm
1	and i m sure that s the system they used to use
1	sometimes they don t make you pay the the fine immediately do they
1	no well that s your choice you can either pay immediately or defer it
1	yeah pause dur short because erm i years and years ago when libraries were much friendlier places i took these library books back for erm er our person who was working as a caretaker you know we used to have students in and erm and i didn t and i forgot to take them i took them in i got them said i would drop them in and i didn t for a couple of days and they went overdue and there were some fines to pay on them and er they said oh you don t have to pay if it s not your book if you are just returning them but as this guy had gone off to work in erm where his country he came from or his mother came from erm finland i think because er i thought it was a bit mean to leave him with a fine as i had trunc enca trunc i d engendered the fine
1	mm pause dur short it was your fault
1	yeah but they seemed to think it was quite erm very good of me to pay the fine unclear but if know if you say you are going to take a book it seemed a bit mean not and he didn t come back to the country for a while but he did come back because he did his pgce in anon type place he liked it up there because erm erm he liked it up because er he was a mountaineer and he had more things to climb
1	yes pause dur short mm pause dur short in anon type place
1	well you can go out to all the
1	well i suppose you can go out to the peak district
1	i mean how far away is the anon type place and people are always shinning up that i mean what have you got here the climbing wall at anon type place
1	that s true pause dur short anon type place well there s not much climbing there is there unless you do horizontal climbing yeah mm mm mm so do you know what what you ve got in mind erm to do when you are at your sister s are you still gonna be clearing out junk
1	who knows pause dur short well i don t know i mean the trouble is i i fear trunc y trunc you know what i m doing at the moment with paperwork if it s junk it s quite easy to dispose of if it s old broke and tatty it s when it s pretty good but not wanted replacement er not you know not replacement what the word is you know new rehoming rehoming is a more difficult scheme
1	mm pause dur short yeah it takes a lot more effort i think you can
1	for example these big speakers especially when they are things that take two people to move
1	mm pause dur short well don t forget you could always contact if you would have to find the right one i know how to do it in anon type place the red cross for instance so phone them up and tell them you ve got them they might well
1	oh i ve got i ve got a list of phone numbers of contacts for like furniture but specialist equipment that is used that is heavy bulky and only used in certain situations probably by a particular sort of person i m going to see how anon nametype f type name feels but erm i might well email anon nametype f type name because her husband erm partner husband i think erm he i don t he may have retired completely now but he used to have quite a good living being a bit retro going around to popstars and people of the older generation who still had recording equipment that you couldn t you know he could mend it and do some of that so i don t know it s the right sort of era
1	yeah pause dur short analogue equipment yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short well that s that s a good source pause dur short and the right sort of thing as well yeah but anon nametype m type name
1	yeah not quite not quite i mean i don t think they ll be playing but i mean trunc h trunc he i think i i spoke to somebody and oh i think it might be anon nametype f type name actually and because she didn t have a contact but i have now got a contact another thing you have to send anon nametype f type name birthday card today she said if anon nametype f type name saw an email for that she probably wouldn t pass it on because she s having a heck of a job trying to get wean him down because he s got really quite a big jukebox in the living room you know he s that sort of person and he erm he was going to get rid of his great big carp which are well most of the garden was a trunc con trunc a trunc c trunc a sort of shed thing to keep his carp in at i suppose at night time i don t know perhaps they stay in all day but you know big carps they need a lot of space to swim around
1	oh right yeah yeah oh yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short the remember the red cross is one of the few places that will take electrical equipment a lot of places won t because if they take it if they are gonna resell it they have to test it which means quite a lot of extra work that s why a lot of the charity shops won t take electrical equipment but you know the big red cross shop in anon type place has got a lot of electrical equipment televisions video recorders and things like that
1	oh right i don t know pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short mm pause dur short also if you need to recycle stuff electrical stuff i i assumed you could take it to anon type place
1	oh yeah you could take it there
1	but it says in the erm whatson in somewhere well one of these things we get news things possibly the anon type place library thing but it s a bit out of their sort of thing for them that they are doing trunc y trunc you can there s a date in july you can take it to anon type place park and ride and there s anon type place anon type place all over the all over the trunc pl trunc all over the county
1	oh pause dur short is is this specific for electrical equipment
1	yeah
1	oh right okay you know it s not that charity again is it
1	no no they well i don t think it is
1	they got their fingers burnt because they ended up with so much stuff
1	no no they they just didn t they they used to come round anon type place because they used to give the parish council some money for doing it they used to advertise they used to collect it take it away but they said the price of scrap has gone down to such a rate that it s just not viable they didn t say anon type place response is overwhelming because everybody found they had a garage full of rubbish
1	money yeah pause dur short mm pause dur short vocal desc laugh electrical rubbish they wanted to get rid of
1	but also when that happened they apparently allegedly didn t get everything they should do because somebody else came round in a white van and
1	helped themselves
1	yes
1	yeah yeah
1	erm but i mean at the moment the the way they re writing like you know you d have to pay these people in white vans to take it away any way you look as though you need to hurry off now
1	mm pause dur short yes unclear
1	okay erm what time do you think you ll vocal desc misc what s the earliest you might go out so we can liaise as necessary
1	about eleven o clock i think
1	oh okay so er that s a little while yet isn t it

1	that we got some
1	we had
1	yeah
1	with the child minding
1	yes
1	vocal desc laugh i don t know why they gave us that
1	they were good
1	yeah but it doesn t really
1	well that s to stop you strangling someone
1	vocal desc laugh it s a weird weird thing to give at a meeting pause dur short anti stress balls
1	vocal desc laugh i don t know why they felt we were stressed out
1	they thought everyone was
1	yeah
1	mm
1	well i think now i know why they give them to you cos the meeting pause dur short all the boring stuff they kept coming out with
1	probably it it was it was pretty awful weren t it
1	yeah
1	yeah pause dur short it was to stop you shouting at the meeting
1	yeah
1	mm
1	they re all a waste of time and they re all money making games that they play
1	i can t believe you have to pay for first aid and
1	yeah
1	stuff now all the courses you have to pay trunc f trunc every course you ve got to pay for
1	yeah well
1	apparently
1	yeah pause dur long every
1	they they always did write it up didn t they in in the book
1	yeah
1	they wrote it up like forty pound a course didn t they
1	they did yeah
1	but then they said it was free to you
1	yeah
1	but it s obviously
1	not free any more
1	getting ready to get the money coming in
1	yeah but that you see the problem is with these organisations they have the people with the hats on who come and give you a talk that get paid an awful lot of money don t they
1	mm
1	they get paid an awful lot of money we do it all because we pause dur short we get nothing for it
1	yeah
1	and you go to these meetings and listen to them rabbiting on about a load of rubbish and they re getting paid all that money
1	and what they ve been trunc tr trunc trying to do all the time is get rid of the small child minders and just kept trunc nur trunc big nurseries everywhere
1	big nurseries yeah that s all they want yeah
1	that s not so good for the children
1	no
1	i think trunc d trunc i mean anon nametype f type name s lucky she can just
1	yeah
1	just have the one person looking after her little one
1	but i m glad we don t do it any more
1	yeah
1	i mean
1	she s going to be better off isn t she
1	she is yeah
1	she s going to be really well off if if it works out well
1	yeah
1	yeah it seems to
1	i d have thought they d have got in touch today
1	i think perhaps tomorrow sundays
1	well anon nametype f type name usually get in touch sunday don t she
1	mm
1	cos anon nametype m type name was round last time she got in touch with us
1	oh yeah pause dur short yeah
1	and she was getting used to her work out there now and
1	was he was he just leaving
1	no he came in and said hello
1	yeah but was it sunday evening
1	it was about four o clock yes it was yeah
1	mm pause dur long
1	yeah so mm pause dur short i was looking forward to seeing her tomorrow or hoping she s going to call tomorrow because she was having a bit of a hard time out there weren t she
1	yeah a little bit wasn t it
1	well she didn t like it that much did she
1	they love the place though don t they
1	they love the place yeah
1	the beach and the swimming that they keep doing
1	i wonder if they got in touch with anon nametype f type name yet
1	i think she dropped that i i don t think it s a good idea anyway
1	well she said she was going to
1	well she no cos she keeps keep on mentioning it
1	no i didn t no i didn t i just asked her if she had and i was then going to say to you i don t think it would be worth it
1	no i don t
1	but you jumped in too quick there pause dur short i mean looking on google where she lives
1	yeah i
1	it didn t look too hot did it
1	no it didn t
1	well hot place but i mean the trunc pl trunc vocal desc laugh it didn t look too good
1	bit deserted wasn t it i mean it s
1	yeah
1	high fences
1	fifteen sixteen foot high fences
1	yeah like a prison camp
1	well if that s the place where she s living
1	mm pause dur short well anon nametype f type name never ever sent back any photographs did she
1	no but anon nametype m type name and anon nametype f type name goes to see her
1	yeah
1	and i went on facebook as well
1	mm pause dur short yeah pause dur long
1	yeah pause dur short well
1	i know they re over there a year so they ve got
1	two years they ve got to be there haven t they
1	well trunc ag trunc and then they trunc g trunc moving to new york aren t they
1	yeah
1	so they a a a year isn t it in san diego
1	and a year there and then a year in new york isn t it
1	yeah
1	she s been to new york she said she didn t like it a lot did she
1	well it s exciting isn t it
1	anon nametype f type name loved new york
1	yeah
1	well it sounded a really great place
1	mm
1	oh dear anyway i think we d better get on with the work now
1	okay i ll get back to work
1	and then er we ll see how much we ve got left to do which is quite a lot
1	so as i m cutting your hair
1	oh yeah
1	do you want to tell me about erm the new phase of your business plan or or the troubleshooting of your business plan
1	well i ve yeah i discovered that there s another erm element to things not just the standard area that i m doing which is the bulls
1	no what i trunc m trunc what i mean is that trunc h trunc how are you going to overcome this problem of the strings breaking at the bottom of the rackets your latest i suggested the pva glue you ve slightly poo pooed that
1	well they re unclear well i didn t really erm the problem with that is that if you just use the glue then i don t think there s any much protection really there s not a lot of protection so i think it s belt and braces i think you need the glue and the tape and then the tape would be quite difficult to get off
1	but i thought you said the tape was no good because they pick it off
1	well i think they would they could well pick it off
1	so what s what s this new
1	well the new thing is these you had to put so to trunc p trunc to protect the frame to trunc pro trunc protect the strings it s to eh somehow put cable ties around in a way that we lift the racket from the ground by about a millimetre unclear only a millimetre i think
1	unclear
1	and these cable ties are that s all the thickness they are they re about a millimetre two millimetres and by putting a series of cable ties around the top then it s going to be protected the strings are going to be protected the strings are going to be protected and trunc tha trunc that should do the job the only problem is that it takes quite a few of these cable ties per racket i think maybe six or seven and even though these are very cheap to buy
1	trunc wh trunc why unclear six or seven if they surely they re only hitting the end unclear
1	well well yes but trunc they trunc they re hitting well as you look at the racket what i ve found is that from the the strings go mainly between eleven o clock and one o clock as you look at the racket okay but quite a few go between ten o clock and two o clock so if they go between ten and two o clock that means you need more ties more of these cable ties to protect a a a larger perimeter so i mean you could just say right all the damage is going to be right at the end it s going to be between eleven o clock and one o clock and then you can get away with four or five ties if you extend that slightly to ten from ten o clock till two o clock then you need two or three more ties which means more work ties are very very cheap so it doesn t really matter about the ties at all then the cost of the ties cos they re ridiculously cheap it s just
1	well trunc ho trunc trunc ho trunc how what what erm cost would it unclear racket
1	well i ve looked on well i looked on the internet and i think you can get a hundred for sixty p so so if they re that cheap
1	oh right it s minimal
1	well it s it s very little it s less it s less than five p a racket
1	but what about
1	trunc r trunc and then so you re charging for the labour unclear
1	yeah what about the labour
1	well that s the next stage i ve got to research because the i ve been on the internet and where you can get the cable ties from you can also buy these machines eh they look a bit like a gun really like a staple gun but you trunc mo trunc you put the ties into the gun erm the eh i think you would have to put both ends in oh no no it s it s a way of tensioning the tie so hopefully the the machines get near enough to the edge of the racket so it can tie it fairly tight so they won t sort of move around when the the racket s being swung they should just be tight enough not to move when they re they re being played with like this one here is moving
1	but but
1	but the this is not moving unclear
1	i can t look because i m cutting your hair
1	okay right
1	we should be having conversations about holidays if i m the hairdresser not about
1	okay but it s yeah it s fine well this is much more interesting
1	is it
1	but there s only these ones that anon nametype m type name put on the other day there s only one that s very loose the rest are all quite tight or tight enough so i think that might be the answer to the answer to the problem
1	but what about changing the erm eh aerodynamics of the of the racket
1	well that s that s i just think that they re just so liked these things i don t think it ll make any difference at all
1	have you played with one
1	no i haven t but i will do that s a very good point so what i ll do tomorrow when i m going to badminton i ll put five on mind you there s a lot of difference between
1	it might improve your game
1	vocal desc laugh there s a lot of difference between the badminton i play and school badminton because my racket s a lot lighter than school rackets you might i might notice it but i m still that s still quite a good idea i could put five or six on and see whether i can still play it also the other thing we ll see if anybody notices it there see whether you know or i could actually say can you notice anything about this racket i think they would because they they do stand out a bit but if i put some very small ties on like these erm trunc invis trunc not invisible ones clear ones and you could show it to someone and say can you see anything notice anything about this racket and it could well be the case that they won t see anything because they re clear they can and from a distance and seeing as they re they re all getting on and their eyesight is not that good
1	who s who the
1	the the players that i play with
1	what they can t see
1	well yeah they can actually a bit of a joke now
1	mm
1	but unclear
1	sorry i missed that
1	you missed that but i think they could they could erm they d have a job to see once it s like more than than the racket s more than about two or three metres away from you i don t think you can see them if you re trunc cl trunc close up within a metre or two metres you d see them but further than that you wouldn t so erm but i think it s a good idea to to play with one it s a very good idea unclear
1	i m just going to put the light on so i can see actually see what i m doing
1	so i can i can do that for tomorrow it s a very good idea play with one and see see if it trunc ma trunc i i m pretty sure because erm i m not very good on weights but i would think that one one of these ties would weigh probably about two grams maybe less i think the shuttlecock weights about five grams so if this weighs only erm so say it s a gram or gram and a half i reckon each tie that would be you would be putting like seven grams seven or eight grams on the racket and the racket weighs eighty grams so you re actually increasing the weight by a nominal ten percent something like that pause dur short and that should be
1	yeah but for aerodynamics that can
1	unclear well it could be that you ll notice it yeah it could be i ll notice it but
1	could be quite serious
1	but for schools is doesn t really matter i don t think i don t i don t think that you know that i that isn t an issue in trunc sc trunc because most school players are not club or county players they re not particularly good they wouldn t notice it i m sure they wouldn t notice it but but what maybe well they they wouldn t notice it when they re playing but it s a question of whether the teachers will accept it as trunc a trunc an addition or there might be a slight health and safety issue aswell i think you mentioned that to me before
1	why
1	well these things protrude don t they slightly if they re tight and are kept inside but i trunc do trunc i think they can still be revolved you can still revolve them around you see what i mean you can still so kids will probably do that
1	yeah but they can t pick them off
1	they can t pick them off they are tamper proof exactly
1	unclear
1	there s no way you can get those out except with a pair of erm tin snips
1	so who who had this idea
1	anon nametype m type name
1	really
1	mm
1	what did he immediately
1	unclear cheesed me off really that he had the idea and i didn t
1	mm
1	he he he mentioned cable ties first and i i couldn t quite see what he was getting at and then he explained it and then he he then i went to his house didn t i went to his garage and then he he got all these cable ties out and we had a look at them all and we took some into the kitchen and then we spent about half an hour three quarters of an hour experimenting he out these on and he also did this as i said this thing with a pipe but that s i think if anything s loose or slightly erm vulnerable the kids will find it out that s why the table cable ties are such a good idea cos they cos they cannot be taken off at all there s no way they can come off except with a tool so the two things that we did that we got quite excited about neither of them is student proof so we d go back to the idea of just putting the ties on with nothing trunc wi trunc with them holding nothing on the racket whatsoever so you just have trunc th trunc the raw cable ties
1	so
1	five or six of them and and that will lift the racket far enough off the floors for them never to for the strings to never come in contact with the floor that s that s what it s all about
1	so are you doing a erm a sort of eh trial unclear trial at that school
1	yeah i think i will i think i will i think i ll say it to him that i ve got a better idea or i ve eh potentially
1	what what have you given him at the moment to try
1	why that s a good question i ve given him three types of racket and they re all colour coded one is just with pva glue which is which was your idea
1	sorry unclear ear
1	so one has just got glue on and i ve colour coded it on but it two trunc w trunc well colour coded it and also marked the racket in case the tape comes off i it s double indemnity er another one was erm pva glue and then allowed to dry and then tape put on the pva glue and the third category was pva glue and immediately put tape over the pva glue so it s put on when when wet so there s the three types of our trialling he knows all about that
1	and when are you when you going back to
1	well i ll leave it a few months i think it s it s got to be over time hasn t it but i can i can actually get it i think i ve got plenty of rackets in the garage i can give him a couple of these or maybe more and say could you could you erm keep this in your fleet of rackets as it were
1	fleet is that what it s called a fleet of rackets
1	well it s a fleet yeah they use the word fleet not just taxis you got like wind turbines a fleet of wind turbines yeah
1	yeah mm
1	yeah fleet is used quite a bit as a compound
1	fleet of cars
1	fleet of cars fleet of taxis fleet of lorries so fleet of rackets
1	unclear no
1	well
1	is that you or
1	well i m i m i m christening our return here
1	unclear your turn it s not an official
1	well i think you can use it feature practice
1	have you heard it before
1	no
1	well i think you re making it up as you go along
1	well i am yeah but i think that i think it s an excellent use of the word
1	vocal desc misc pause dur short right
1	so if i give him like three of these rackets three or four or i could just go back and say which rackets are gone i ll mend them and then i ll i ll put this this device on cos he s up for it he says it s a good plan and he s willing to help
1	is he not the stressed out teacher
1	he probably is a stressed out teacher but he s at least got time to email me occasionally so he can t be that stressed out
1	unclear primary school
1	pardon
1	primary school is it
1	no no it s a secondary school
1	oh
1	second of course it s anon nametype m type name
1	mm
1	but it s in anon type place so yeah they you you wouldn t have the problem in a primary school because a the kids don t play badminton in the same way that they do in secondary school and b if they and and that assumes they re playing the majority won t play badminton in a primary school but those that do play they the level would be very low and they they wouldn t be swinging the rackets around on the floor like they do in secondary school which is where all the damage takes place so it s it s purely a secondary school idea this primary schools you can do the erm you can do the the unclear of the rackets and not that s what i did with anon nametype f type name is that alright
1	what with her school
1	er yeah well with anon nametype f type name erm she gave me i she gave me i think she gave me something like thirty hockey sticks and about thirty rackets and not one of those cases did you think well obviously not for the hockey sticks but for the tennis rackets not one set of strings had gone it was just pure erm grips that needed replacing so had she gone to her catalogue and got erm tennis rackets new which is what she was going to do they would have trunc ch trunc they would have cost anywhere between nine and fourteen pound and i trunc me trunc i gave a special rate but i mended them for under three pounds okay so she was very grateful so
1	so that proved to you that primary schools don t unclear same problem
1	well i m trunc pr trunc pretty sure because i mean that school does a lot of sport and they they do tennis they erm i don t think the badminton rackets would ever wear out really unless they played every day with them but i m sure they don t i ve just actually given anon nametype f type name thirty two rackets so erm but i i m confident that they won t wear out because i i know the way that badminton is taught and she uses unclear balls as well so i i know that they won t be it s just a completely different ball game as it were
1	i ve cut your ear you know there s blood there
1	dreadful
1	i ll just get the tissue
1	how did you do that
1	i don t know they must be very sharp the scissors
1	oh well i i said
1	i said i nearly cut your ear
1	i said be careful but you ve got three lots of scissors here four lots of scissors and you ve probably chosen the sharpest one
1	i trunc s trunc i suppose you could sue me really
1	no i wouldn t do that so going back to this now you know quite a lot about the whole thing would you would you say this is a trunc sol trunc good solution to the problem these
1	i yeah i think it is
1	right well that s good
1	i just i think it s the best you ve had so far
1	yeah
1	looks best
1	it s just you need quite a few of these ties i think you need probably seven
1	i don t unclear
1	just so that is a bit labour intensive isn t it
1	well you ll just have to up the price
1	yeah well what you do you d explain it it s future proof i think that s quite a good term future proof you re trunc frui trunc future proofing the rackets and you d have a guarantee that if they went to the trunc to trunc if the strings went to the top within say a few months six months then you would do the job for nothing you would trunc me trunc and you re not losing anything there cos i d i m pretty sure they would never go they and they don t go in the middle i know that from mending about three hundred rackets
1	but if you get okay let s imagine you get all this sorted out
1	mm yeah
1	erm what about your marketing is that unclear getting lots of orders
1	no not getting very many at the moment i ve got to have a i ve got to have another campaign on marketing cos i a lot of a lot of flyers have gone out but not many people have erm
1	unclear that s that s sorry that setting on that trimmer is that s just shaving the whole head
1	i know
1	i trunc didn trunc didn t want that i need a number
1	well you know you ve got to got to put these on
1	well can you put it on you usually do that
1	it s this one i think
1	it ll have a stripe up the back cos it s taken all the hair off
1	well that s great
1	vocal desc laugh i cut your ear unclear spike in your hairdo
1	oh trunc d trunc oh dear what about that then
1	not well you need
1	that s about right
1	mm
1	not that unclear
1	okay
1	alright
1	i ll do another stripe
1	well don t cos you unclear
1	i m afraid unclear bald bit there i ve cut
1	could you start at the other end sorry pause dur short how does that go
1	it s not it s not short enough
1	not short enough okay give it back
1	it s not
1	well that s that s as far as it can go
1	can you take your glasses off
1	yeah sure
1	right sorry i distracted you what erm you you were talking about the marketing
1	marketing yeah well i think maybe i ve just got to concentrate on local schools and just pick the rackets up that s something doesn t seem
1	it doesn t seem to want to power through
1	why is that
1	maybe it s too short for i just unclear cut the hair quite long quite short i mean
1	well maybe that s it maybe unclear
1	and there s a load of hair in there could you
1	vocal desc misc
1	eh don t you re putting it all over the floor now
1	well give that a whirl
1	can you pick up that bits of hair vocal desc misc unclear
1	but i think
1	sorry yeah go on
1	well the thing is to to convince schools that they would be saving money and if they re
1	yeah but how are you
1	unclear well in two ways to mend to mend their trunc ra trunc
1	oh it s not trunc switche trunc this thing isn t switched on
1	oh right
1	that s why i haven t got the power right we re in business now
1	oh
1	sorry i keep interrupting you yeah go on marketing how are you going to get customers
1	well i think the main the main marketing really is the practicality of the idea and the economy of the idea if i can convince them that would they would save like hundreds of pounds a year on rackets then i think it s a given that they would they would go for it but one idea might be to actually talk on the phone to not the pe department but the bursar or the person who picks up the phone who s in charge of money and say i can save your school a hundred two hundred pounds a year every year by a very simple measure would you like to hear about it how would that be
1	well i don t know anything unclear about string unclear
1	because if they if the string goes then they have to replace the racket which would cost them anywhere between five and ten pound pause dur short okay and that s what schools do they don t they don t mend them so i mean that school the other day that erm they d got in touch with me when we were on holiday they they he said he thought it was a very good idea but all these rackets had gone er and then i went over when we came back from holiday and i picked them up and i had a look at them all and they had all gone in the same way in the same place and then i got back in touch with him and i trunc sa trunc i explained exactly what had happened erm and that s when i thought of using that school as a kind of erm
1	guinea pig
1	guinea pig research project and he was very willing to take part in it but things had moved on so we d moved on from glue to tape
1	so are you charging him for this stuff or are you
1	well i i said you know in because you re going to help us with this project i ll do these rackets for nothing he was trunc wi trunc very willing to pay for them but i the trade off was that he s going to take part in this project
1	well that s good
1	so i thought well that s that s means it s free from he thinks he s getting something for nothing and i think i m getting something for nothing or very little so if he keeps an eye on the rackets i ve colour coded them and marked them so i ll know exactly what s happened so he can see whether the ones that i ve given him are you know have more protection and i ll slip in four or five more rackets into his fleet
1	vocal desc laugh fleet
1	fleet of rackets and and see what unclear i will actually phone him up eh in trunc a trunc after half term and say have you got any rackets and i ll put these this additional measure on and see whether it works the best solution though as i explained to you is to have the rackets made properly so that the strings don t protrude
1	well that s a huge business project
1	well it s a good project that that means a trip to anon type place or anon type place you ve got contacts in anon type place maybe you could chat up some of your contacts
1	mm
1	have you
1	well i don t think they d be much good at making rackets
1	well they might be able to introduce me to the people who might be able to do it or at least do some research in their own language no
1	mm well it would cost you so much money to pay unclear
1	i know but but but it solves the problem that s and maybe they re aware of it and they just want to carry on with these rackets knowing that they re going to keep coming back with repeat orders because the strings are going to break maybe they know all about that maybe they re very canny or maybe no maybe it s just one of those things they never bothered to address
1	but it s been happening for years hasn t it
1	i presume it will be unclear
1	unclear
1	presumably it has they just need protection that s where the cable ties come in it s like such a good idea but i i think there might be something that you can put some kind of guard that you could put and lock on so it was tamper proof which would be one operation well one operation as opposed to six or seven operations
1	no but why you you just need to mm
1	that s all i m saying
1	you just deeper grooves don t you
1	well that s yeah no ideally that s what they need deeper grooves exactly but there might be trunc some trunc something that you can clip on cos you you said that you can remember when you were playing tennis at a high level that you used to clip something on to your racket plastic and i i can
1	yeah a guard but it affected it affected the play that s why unclear
1	well yes but you re you re a very advanced player you see so
1	oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah vocal desc laugh
1	well it s a very good question to ask but i will i will do that erm it s it s worth cos you ve got to experiment haven t you you ve got to do your research
1	yeah
1	and know that like they will stay on they won t rattle about and eh they won t after their playing so i ll do that tomorrow i ll put the very light ones on i think not the these ones are smaller unclear see these these are narrower and shorter
1	yeah
1	so they they re even better maybe
1	erm so yeah can you just make this machine go so that i can do a
1	i need to put my glasses on for that
1	well they re erm a shave without any numbers
1	oh i see i see what you mean have you finished
1	no i ve just got to do the back of the neck
1	oh right okay well that s what i meant but you can still does it look alright
1	it s too short and you ve got a bleeding ear but otherwise it s very good
1	oh ah otherwise it s fine yeah well that s good i ll come back to this salon in future then
1	sorry about that but i don t know what happened really
1	that s alright mm
1	right erm it s okay i ll just do this last bit
1	yeah that was a good idea to try it out first but if i can get these rackets in the hands of these kids erm the next half the next half of the term i ll have a really good idea about how they work maybe i ll put different types you can actually get quite thick ones so if you had trunc ca trunc
1	sorry can you not move and look the other way it s like it s like look slightly to the right
1	oh right okay so it s possible to have thicker ones but that s quite a lot more expensive
1	can you look that way thank you
1	so
1	head that way but down no that s it
1	you can have like double double the width but it s interesting obviously the the more plastic they put in the more they re going to charge you so
1	and the other way thank you
1	and the other thing is the more plastic you have at the top of the racket the erm the heavier it s going to be and erm unclear pause dur short anyway it could be it s a dragon s den type of idea but i don t think unclear would go for it did you know he used to coach tennis that s how he started making money
1	who
1	anon nametype m type name he was a very good tennis player
1	oh the dragon s den man
1	yeah so when he was fifteen or sixteen he coached tennis for money and that s what put the entrepreneurial bug into him i think
1	mm
1	that s how he started making money he s a big tall bloke isn t he
1	mm
1	so maybe he d go for this idea
1	right that completes the hairdressing don t look in the mirror cos i don t think you ll be very pleased
1	oh thank you very much pause dur short what am i m balder now
1	a bit vocal desc laugh
1	really
1	well you shouldn t have let it grow so long erm and then it would have been easier somehow to cut or i need to go to evening classes in haircutting
1	so what trunc y trunc trunc y trunc
1	it it was so long that it i had to cut with scissors
1	why don t you ask anon nametype f type name she s or she hasn t got who s got level three anon nametype f type name you go to anon nametype f type name
1	well you d have you d have you d have to go the salon and pay twenty five quid
1	anon nametype f type name s got level three so
1	vocal desc laugh
1	so or maybe i should go there do you think she d do unclear
1	well yeah and pay and pay twenty five quid
1	is that how much they charge
1	no you d probably get about fifteen
1	but even so i can remember paying no when i was about i think two shillings was about the going rate
1	anyway pause dur short mm
1	and that s what ten p in today s money
1	mm times have changed haven t they and i need i need a big tip as well ten percent
1	unclear really do you do you tip when you go to anon nametype f type name
1	yep
1	do you and anon nametype f type name
1	yeah
1	well don t they build that into the price
1	no it s an english tradition to being a hairdresser anyway that s enough for now
1	well they should do ah right have they got a fleet of scissors
1	i don t know vocal desc laugh
1	there we are
1	right
1	so are you are you supportive of this idea do you think it s going to work
1	yeah i think you should just try it out and see how it goes
1	well i will do
1	and with a new haircut you might unclear
1	unclear i ll be aerodynamic
1	yep
1	so in some ways you know that that s good because the total package means i m probably lighter even with the ties in the racket
1	yeah
1	but i haven t got as much hair
1	erm if you re approaching business men in discussions they ll probably prefer the shorter hair cut
1	mm pause dur short you reckon
1	maybe let s let s take the positives
1	well i don t unclear i think you done it sort of you butchered me a bit
1	mm best not to look in the mirror
1	mm okay
1	okay i m going to turn off the machine now
0	yep
0	oh yes it did pause dur short it was
0	before
0	yeah indeed
0	unclear interesting
0	oh police cars
0	or
0	which was presumably why that guy had so many
0	and trunc ve trunc very kind of captivating i think pause dur short like the it was vocal desc laugh really quite gripping i think pause dur short and the way they built it up as well was really nice pause dur short so you had all the bits at the beginning and sort of really interesting costumes and and stuff
0	mm
0	all that kind of idea and the sort of um playing the media pause dur short an image trunc s trunc kind of idea about it pause dur short the sort of miss congeniality question bit
0	um
0	i i was just like as i was watching it i i wasn t sure whether it was gonna be kind of say three films for for the whole story or whether they were gonna stop halfway through the game pause dur short um but i couldn t really see them
0	just a to keep to keep sort of milking that one pause dur short i love the idea of it being like a a computerized thing they could put in little
0	what was i gonna say um pause dur short um pause dur short unclear well i just find it fascinating as an exercise in tactics
0	mm
0	then that means you have good odds of surviving the first half
0	and then you
0	but then that s the hard bit pause dur short yeah
0	but i assumed that the friend was gonna be killed
0	yes exactly pause dur short and i mean as it was a book for teenagers in that the love kind of idea and it was trunc ve trunc you were right it was very twighlight pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	er
0	vocal desc laugh
0	so therefore we contain different amounts of stored energy
0	vocal desc laugh
0	trunc l trunc um what was i gonna say tut
0	yeah um apart from being quite twightlighty it was good pause dur short or rather despite being quite quite twighlighty it was good
0	no i don t think so because if she was doing it to survive she would have killed him at the end
0	yes but no but she knew that she was going to survive even she knew she had better odds of survival if she didn t do that pause dur short that s the point pause dur short that which so disproves that
0	okay pause dur short fair enough
0	completely taking that the wrong way pause dur short i think she s into both of them pause dur short which is where the conflicting interest comes in
0	and thought well i don t want this game to be like you know cos they said at the beginning um that if they could do something
0	yeah yeah yeah yeah
0	no but i m saying maybe she wasn t willing to die to not let the games win
0	probably not because she was very keen to get home to her sister pause dur short that was the unclear priority throughout pause dur short so it would have to have been a much stronger reason than sort of general social
0	but i
0	i just wasn t convinced pause dur short i didn t trunc th trunc i
0	well that s probably the acting
0	well yeah possibly pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	no idea
0	mm
0	it seemed to be pause dur short it was interesting unclear
0	yes
0	unclear tell who d died
0	what cos teenagers are quite horrible
0	no but as in like
0	the people particularly it s particularly disturbing in the opening sequences as in people you were training you were
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	targets
0	i think i would ve been very quickly killed pause dur short vocal desc laugh oh my phone just buzzed pause dur short oh it s it s that alarm i set pause dur short aha pause dur short flight sale pause dur short vocal desc laugh there we are
0	yeah pause dur short i would ve literally like yeah dug a hole pause dur short sat in it until everybody else had gone home pause dur short you know pause dur short vocal desc laugh um which might have worked pause dur short i dunno
0	but would they have
0	but i assumed that they d leave it in as fair and i was surprised that they interfered because they d think that would be unpopular
0	yeah yeah
0	mind you of course they re trying to make it interesting so it s just like reality tv pause dur short yeah
0	unclear
0	er pause dur short well i think it was definitely the right policy to run at the start pause dur short um
0	yes pause dur short um pause dur short but i think she should ve more actively tried to hunt them pause dur short as in
0	mm
0	well while she was up in the tree could she not have shot them
0	no no that s right pause dur short er pause dur short but
0	um so when the they left the stuff all piled up and there was one guy left on guard
0	she trunc ha trunc she obviously wouldn t really have worked as a character and stuff
0	er to take it to another extreme unclear all of that actually the character thing does kind of work because you want people who are watching to like you
0	yeah pause dur short um
0	in all fairness i mean the trunc who trunc er if people are into that kind of like programme if you like that kind of entertainment then you d think they d be they d be quite you know they wouldn t mind so much if you were killing people cos
0	mm
0	then that wouldn t that count in your favour pause dur short er people fundamentally like an underdog pause dur short it s it but it you know unclear chance
0	that s why out of the question always worked well cos it s always not unclear expect it to be
0	so obvious
0	now i m a little bit concerned about going back on the anon type place bypass because it s that sort of time on a saturday night where you might get boy racers up there
0	we ll see
0	i guess
0	yes pause dur short just unclear a little bit of forward planning
0	ah
0	it s er yeah
0	there s a unclear um
0	yeah pause dur short true pause dur short they d wouldn t have fitted in one of those little balloon things though pause dur short vocal desc laugh a full dart rifle
0	er
0	that s what i was just what i was thinking it was all bows and arrows and swords trunc i trunc in this kind of
0	well if a rock was covered in a particular material it wouldn t be that difficult to
0	so even if he was wounded that could ve worked quite well
0	anyway
0	yeah um pause dur short no i agree pause dur short that could ve worked quite well pause dur short um
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but that s the thing pause dur short i think it s a children s book cos trunc c trunc children trunc ju trunc just read it and see it at face value pause dur short but if they actually start to think about what it would actually involve if it i think it s that s why it s almost more disturbing for someone who s actually a bit older and thinks
0	you re fighting to you know often for a country or to
0	and there s something driving you
0	yeah exactly pause dur short but that s why it s disturbing
0	mm
0	no but not like unclear that s a sort of that s a unclear setting for a storyline which is fun and fantasy pause dur short this is trunc ent trunc this is entire premise pause dur short the entire er er there is no plot around it pause dur short this is the plot
0	mm
0	also a bit like noughts and crosses
0	um and that s
0	oh i see what they did there with the noughts
0	yeah yeah sure pause dur short ah it s probably cos you didn t let your mum know till we got back pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	no exactly pause dur short no pause dur short unclear but she will think we set off at half five and haven t got back to anon type place yet
0	vocal desc laugh yes pause dur short she wouldn t have known that we stopped somewhere
0	it said voice mailbox number pause dur short is that nine o one
0	do you wanna just leave it or
0	but that would be an entirely different book
0	yeah but it wasn t as in
0	and the fact they chose not to go into that and to make it very simplistic didn t remove that threat or that menace
0	well no it s the same story pause dur short it s just more
0	the teenage market
0	well i do
0	okay pause dur short i mean i i trunc th trunc i think so for example at the age of how old would i have been thirteen maybe i read a book about the death of god pause dur short and that s inappropriate material for a child of that age pause dur short they can t think about theology in that kind of way
0	okay
0	it s a far less disturbing concept
0	good
0	just marred
0	i d have said you shouldn t have it was brilliant pause dur short it was well made pause dur short it was a very good premise pause dur short it just wasn t executed in either a way that either it was appropriate or that was fulfilling its potential
0	yes well i think that s trunc f trunc again a problem for ratings um mm
0	trunc y trunc yeah he was just being awkward about the fact that that s what people do except they only release the nicer one normally pause dur short um so yeah that was a a toned down version cos it would ve i think they trunc prob trunc what they probably do is give it a sort of rough rating and then they can
0	well to be fair it was very formulatic formulaic pause dur short as in there was probably very you know it was probably for the tight guidelines
0	the boxes aren t subjective but the things that you are choosing for the boxes are
0	unclear
0	well they were rating silent films
0	er yeah trunc w trunc trunc w trunc um what was i saying um pause dur short oh yeah that was it yeah pause dur short so it had sort of all the ratings and then and um in the middle it had the new twelve a rating pause dur short and i was like oh that was how many years ago ten years ago
0	about that
0	unclear
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh possibly
0	vocal desc laugh yeah cos if it was all films like spiderman that which i think was a twelve a um
0	yeah
0	i think even at the time vocal desc laugh we realized
0	yeah pause dur short yeah
0	first lord of the rings i don t think you were that old cos i wasn t fifteen pause dur short um
0	er in that ballpark anyway pause dur short fifteen sixteen
0	oh no it was very scary pause dur short presumably it just stayed just the right side of it to be given the pg pause dur short whereas the second and third ones didn t pause dur short they trunc s trunc presumably skipped over the line
0	the first one was by far the scariest
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	you er
0	mm pause dur short it s pretty close
0	the unclear yeah
0	no pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	living dangerously pause dur short er
0	so trunc l trunc let s not do that pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	did yeah do you wanna go and see if that s open
0	actually yeah
0	i i wouldn t mind something to eat pause dur short and we could just go back and bung something in the microwave out of the freezer pause dur short like
0	mm
0	not very appetizing
0	it s just
0	i wish when it was blatantly obvious what you were doing
0	christ pause dur short some people are ignorant
0	vocal desc laugh yeah you were right behind him
0	er so what looks open
0	maximum stay four hours pause dur short probably alright then
0	right
0	and that was when we had er we met well with that man anon nametype m type name wasn t it
0	yeah had a bit of a yeah
0	lunch and then dashed off got a tight schedule of that in well it s just like
0	right
0	i dunno why like about i think three weeks ago there was this erm big anon type place weekend and like
0	all over the place and i generally this is the first weekend i ve actually been able to like be at home
0	that s what you need sometimes is to have that break
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	oh yeah
0	cos i had i booked the whole week off
0	well they didn t go anywhere
0	yeah
0	he was like oh i trunc w trunc you know i ll probably book it and then
0	so i ended just like cancelling my holiday and just taking
0	thursday and friday off and i went for a bike ride in anon type place
0	yeah

0	and it it kind of worked and then you know like when you want it gooey in the middle
0	but then it s trunc g trunc
0	i just
0	no one s gonna know
0	then i was like i just couldn t decide whether it was raw or gooey
0	yeah
0	but you
0	all of that cos you
0	eat it all the time

0	i ve not been to i don t think no i ve not been to any of germany before i ve not done any of it
0	oh
0	you definitely have to balance out the history with
0	something fun because
0	uhu
0	it s really depressing like we went to like the jewish memorials
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah we ve just seen a whole museum based on millions of people being murdered pause dur short and you kind of like

0	but there s like the thing with prague is that s it s really like some of it s it s really oldie worldie
0	and the other part is really heavily communist
0	vocal desc laugh
0	but the buildings that i ve seen like on pictures and they re like oh like the
0	yeah
0	this guy who i work with who sits opposite me he literally goes on like holiday like every few months
0	cos you just wanna go everywhere in the summer
0	you live at home and i m so jealous i pay something like what do i trunc pa trunc five fifty a month mind you that is bills included but it s
0	between five fifty and six hundred pounds a month
0	yeah
0	which is well cos you that s
0	to live inside of anon type place is awfully expensive
0	really expensive like my mum kept being like anon nametype f type name why don t you buy us a flat you know why don t you buy a flat in anon type place i was like
0	mother do you have four hundred thousand pounds to spare
0	for two bed it s like a two bed flat
0	into the centre
0	everywhere
0	in that way but it s just
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	but
0	uhu
0	yeah
0	centre is really small so
0	yeah
0	and then you have to travel into the centre which takes longer and it s further away whereas
0	uhu
0	better social life and that kind of stuff
0	vocal desc laugh i can imagine do you you have grown up there all your life
0	all that that like getting out and about and like it s just you know
0	which is so sad
0	are you thinking of like moving job or changing job at all
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	i know that i i i wouldn t have to like scrimp or anything cos i know
0	but i just feel like if i have that money just when it s just gone
0	yeah
0	it s true and i couldn t afford to buy anything in london so
0	for like
0	social like oh it s just
0	the balance is just not there until i decide oh unless there s an amazing job that i can t turn down
0	forty grand vocal desc laugh
0	er
0	oh this looks great
0	i know
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh
0	until i think it s trunc se trunc mid september i m technically finished but
0	they always
0	because
0	yeah cos it trunc wa trunc other thing if trunc th trunc if i was so bad they would trunc lea trunc like they d let me go like years like literally
0	yeah
0	at the start like you wouldn t wait like a whole
0	you re welcome
0	enjoy
0	yeah
0	oh if you yeah by the way your job s still there if you want it you know
0	you know all that trunc posit trunc you know all that stuff but
0	mm
0	and your team and stuff like my team s like three people so when he goes i ll be the one who knows the systems
0	when she does come back she s only coming back part time
0	uhu
0	yeah
0	since may and it s now what the beginning of august
0	that s like the worst thing though isn t it it s like
0	yeah and be there in person or whatever
0	yeah
0	uhu
0	i don t know if i learn that way
0	uhu oh it s
0	it trunc ju trunc
0	uhu that s what s the hard thing cos trunc li trunc you work all day and then it s like you wanna do stuff as well as study
0	same
0	if you don t get to actually switch off when you get to that level like probably one day but at the minute it s like i want my social time i want to just
0	oh yes it does
0	that s it feels like it you know when you think that it s not been that long though since they like finished i remember that
0	sorry to interrupt you ladies how is everything
0	it s good thank you
0	i m alright thank you for the moment
0	okay
0	like the bits that you can cut up into pieces and i like decorating them and all that stuff but
0	i made a victoria sponge the other week for my grandad and that was actually quite good
0	but you see i or i d tell you know when you can you can t find what you re looking for and then you
0	and it s annoying when you go to somewhere like the anon type place bakery or something
0	and you try all of their cakes and then you buy their book and you try and make the cake and
0	oh yeah
0	and then we never did them
0	yeah
0	unclear replacement unclear yeah
0	aren t good at it
0	yeah vocal desc laugh
0	mm

0	like i love it
0	and erm pause dur short and one of my friends really likes the exhibitions as well like they do a lot of
0	i ve been i ve been to one of their dress ones years ago

0	yeah pause dur short and like there were so many nice exhibitions on there but there was always something we d like to see so
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh
0	he just i think it was just to do with people
0	they want the food that s what they want
0	no like yeah well yeah and the minions movie was kind of separate from despicable me
0	and it was awful
0	have you not oh we went to see

1	good morning anon nametype m type name thank you
1	good morning
1	for talking to me vocal desc laugh so here we are erm in anon type place in the field that belongs to the parish council and is erm you re out here with the model engineers on a working party this morning
1	correct
1	erm tell me why do you come
1	to try and support the engineering club with a little bit of manual labour i like to support them in in other ways rather than just attending to play trains
1	yeah that s great because there are always jobs to be done out here aren t there
1	there are indeed yes
1	yeah so how long have you been coming
1	probably for the last er four months now i think it s
1	right so you re quite a new boy doing this then
1	oh yes
1	oh right
1	yeah
1	so erm what are your what are trunc y trunc what are the jobs you like doing best
1	i don t mind really i i just like to be involved erm the i would say the other way the one thing i don t like very much is painting
1	oh right is it is it is it any particular reason or
1	it s just something i don t enjoy i ve always been involved with the building trade in one form or another since national service
1	right
1	erm so i m quite practically minded can
1	right
1	turn my hand to most things
1	right okay
1	yeah
1	and what what what was your role when you did your national service
1	i was in royal airforce signals
1	right
1	erm which was pause dur short particularly based in erm private or secret locations such as underground signal centres
1	really
1	erm so that all of the raf signal traffic was kept confidant
1	right
1	and secret as necessary
1	right is that still the case or is that all opened up now
1	i er think it with the new technology everything has changed
1	right
1	erm in trunc d trunc the days i was doing national service it was all gpo telephone equipment er so you had gpo engineers but i would imagine now it s all high technology internet all sorts
1	right
1	i don t know now
1	right well erm so much i mean so much has been brought to the fore with the easement of the erm the secrets act hasn t it
1	yeah
1	recently
1	yeah
1	and erm where they did er i can t remember the place erm where they did all the decoding erm machines erm bickley not bickley something like that
1	bletchley park
1	trunc b trunc bletchley park
1	yes
1	we went to bletchley park quite recently
1	yeah
1	anon nametype m type name wanted to go and
1	yeah
1	we went have you been there
1	ironically we only live forty miles away and i ve never been there
1	really
1	erm watched documentaries on the programme er very interesting to see what they did but i ve never actually been to the site
1	no and did you see the film recently
1	yes
1	did you that was trunc rea trunc
1	incredible
1	yeah alan turing
1	absolutely amazing
1	was it alan turing
1	yes
1	yeah
1	yeah and what a tragic life
1	what a tragic life
1	for what he contributed to this country s security
1	i know that wasn t that cumberbatch didn t he play
1	yes it was
1	yeah he did he was very good wasn t he
1	he trunc wa trunc he was absolutely brilliant it s well worth anyone watching that film
1	yeah
1	to get a better understanding of what was involved
1	yeah i mean you can as you say you can learn so much and er conversely we saw the suffragettes recently have
1	trunc ye trunc
1	you seen that
1	no i haven t seen that
1	erm well we asked someone to come with us and she said she didn t want to come because it would horrible and they tortured them and all that sort of thing but actually it was a very good film and it was in the same vein
1	yes
1	it was an educational film
1	yeah yes
1	it was i reckon a drama documentary
1	yeah trunc i trunc it does trunc i trunc it records history which will be forgotten if someone does not record it
1	no
1	as such
1	and erm
1	yeah
1	that s great i mean they can keep doing downton abbey until they re blue in the face by just making up plots it just turns
1	yeah
1	into coronation street really
1	yeah
1	but erm with these sort of spot erm interests i was i i m related to lloyd george the prime minister erm very distantly but i am related to him i mean everybody laughs and says they re related to lloyd george but i am and he was in the suffragette film or the actor playing lloyd george
1	right
1	was in the suffragette film and that was very interesting
1	yeah
1	so i recommend it to you it s not erm a bit like the turing film it it s not erm it trunc does trunc you don t come out feeling happy it s not a happy film
1	no
1	but at the same it s trunc i trunc instructional and and you can
1	yeah
1	get the gist of the ideas at the time
1	well there is so much we don t know about for instance world war two
1	yeah
1	you know erm for example my father was a military policeman
1	oh was he
1	erm and he served in north africa and italy tunisia and he ended up in romania and people say we we didn t have forces in romania but we did
1	right
1	we had a military police detachment there
1	right
1	were basically doing what this country did in pause dur short iraq i think when they sent out police first of all and there was a sad loss of seven policemen who were
1	really
1	mobbed and killed
1	yes
1	by a gang er that s what my father did it was a small group of policemen
1	really
1	in romania erm he had collected a large number of photographs posing with russian officers
1	right
1	all sorts local people local events er when he died i asked my children erm these photographic albums are quite an unusual record
1	uhu
1	erm if i give them to you will what will you do with them
1	mm
1	and they said well we ll take care of them dad you know
1	yeah
1	and i so i chose then i asked their consent and i donated them all the military police museum
1	oh right
1	and they were actually thrilled to bits because apparently they get loads of paperwork about servicemen
1	yeah
1	rarely get any photographs
1	right right
1	and there s my dad in his military police uniform
1	oh
1	with his jeep
1	yeah
1	posing with russian officers it incredible record they were thrilled to bits so it they ve got all his personal documentation his id cards his medals he was mentioned in dispatches
1	yeah
1	they ve got a complete record of one sergeant in
1	yeah
1	military police
1	a real family pride then on an trunc anc trunc er as of an ancestor really
1	yes and i didn t want it to get lost in the future
1	no no
1	i thought that
1	speak up oh they ve gone by
1	if it goes if it goes into history like that
1	yeah
1	that s a good record of world war two
1	right yes
1	from an unusual aspect of it you know
1	yes exactly yeah it is
1	and he did survive the war
1	yes
1	er it did torment him later in life
1	yes yeah
1	but erm yeah
1	how do you trunc fee trunc if you can speak up a little more because we ve got some people outside erm how do you see then when you see flog it and people are selling their medals and
1	i i don t really like it but i trunc th trunc i don t think you can you you can t manage it can you they they become erm valued items and people will sell them erm if the family don t take care of them and pass them on
1	yes
1	to different generations
1	yes
1	then they get lost anyway
1	yeah yeah
1	it s sad that they ve become an item for making money on
1	oh it does it is yeah
1	but that s again why i decided that my father s record and his medals
1	yeah
1	should all go to the military police
1	yes exactly yeah and and you and and that s right and and it s assured now and you you can rest rest assured i mean i ve got a collection of erm lloyd george memorabilia not that i ve they re just things that
1	vocal desc misc
1	the family had that for some reason people gave to me no one else wanted them
1	no
1	and erm i got a lot of books erm and trunc m trunc my idea one day was to go through them and maybe write something of my own but i m actually more of a novel writer and a poetry i m i m in the middle of a novel at the moment i m on page er on chapter fourteen erm of my first novel and i ve done a poetry book so far erm but erm that s what i m doing but anyway erm back to you so do you do any writing at all
1	no i i i m not a writer cum author of any sort i do enjoy putting letters together
1	right
1	and there s plenty of opportunity with the problems that we have these days
1	yes that s right
1	and whether it be problems with power companies or whatever
1	yeah
1	and i quite enjoy putting letters together
1	yeah yeah
1	and making my point
1	yes
1	but without being too rude about it
1	no exactly well you you know who was a past master at that was charles dickens
1	oh right yeah
1	if you ever get a chance to look up charles dickens his letters to his clock maker or clock mender erm he wrote some very witty letters erm and i won t i i can t repeat it in the same way as charles dickens wrote it so it s best that you look it up because it s very entertaining
1	okay
1	really very entertaining indeed erm so yeah but erm it is nice to bring if you re complaining about something it s nice to bring a bit of humour into it don t you find that
1	oh i think so er you need to make the point strongly that you are trying to get home
1	yeah
1	on the other hand you don t demand
1	no
1	you may expect but not demand
1	yeah yeah
1	er and i always try to put a sensible letter together and i always try to keep it to one page
1	yes that s right
1	i think people don t like to go
1	no
1	onto a second page
1	no it s the same if you re applying for a job it s always best to keep it on one page
1	on one page
1	yeah
1	yeah
1	one page erm and also in to my mind i always make the typeface slightly larger because it s easier to read erm er you know if if type if the type is very small people even younger people have got challenging eye problems haven t they whoa it s getting a bit noisy outside isn t it
1	vocal desc laugh
1	anyway we ve got another five minutes to do so
1	that s okay
1	we ll have to trunc sh trunc you ll have to shout you see erm so erm are you involved in this erm show that they re going to put on next year
1	i don t have any details at the moment
1	you don t no
1	of the show and i don t know what s planned
1	no no
1	but i would like to be involved anyway
1	yeah yeah okay well i m sure they i m sure that we will be erm erm it ll be all hands on deck won t it
1	i would imagine so if there s some
1	yeah
1	big function
1	i was trunc hopi trunc i mean always when they ve done shows before i i ve always brought my art along trunc wh trunc when when they were in the schools like they had one in the school erm several years erm and i brought my art trunc arou trunc along and erm exhibited it but i didn t make any sales because it s not that sort of show i do think though trunc may trunc maybe you might like to press the point erm you didn t hear it here that there might be some things for women because if the men come if you do something for women as well then it ll mean you ll get more support all the way round and i think that ll be a good idea really
1	i think it s important that you do try and involve the ladies these days you know otherwise erm they can become treated as vocal desc laugh er tea makers and
1	yes
1	and that s trunc n trunc that s not on
1	that s not on
1	you know trunc th trunc it s
1	that s not on
1	it s better that they take a an interesting
1	yeah
1	er role in the organisation even if it s only from time to time
1	yeah somebody asked me er or a few years ago now if i d like to make the teas for something that an organisation that anon nametype m type name was part of and i trunc s trunc i said to my husband well if i was holding an art group would he come and make the teas for me
1	vocal desc laugh
1	he wouldn t so i said no i m not doing it erm
1	no
1	because erm you know women aren t just hangers on
1	no
1	they re people in their own right and to be treated like that it s it s going back victorian times
1	it is it is
1	erm and it s erm although i m not terrifically women s lib i m i believe in equality and that s not treating people equally at all
1	at at times in my last employment with the building society er i had a rather problematical manager to deal with
1	yeah
1	and his secretary started to follow his same attitude and she was quite rude to me one day
1	really
1	and i went to both him and the girl and i said i don t mind whether you call me anon nametype m type name or mr anon nametype n type name
1	right
1	i don trunc m trunc you choose i said but i do expect you to respect my age and my experience in the way you speak to me
1	yeah yeah
1	and i said and i don t mind whether i work for a lady manager
1	yeah
1	or a male manager
1	yeah
1	i m quite happy
1	yeah
1	as long as they know what they are doing
1	yeah
1	as long as they know the job
1	yes exactly exactly
1	and i ve always felt that way and there is
1	exactly
1	to that degree equality is most important that women should have the opportunity
1	yeah yes trunc i trunc it is very important
1	yeah
1	i mean the erm use of the word lady is erm is great and i was brought up to use it because it was erm a term of respect
1	yes
1	but these days i mean you think if you go to the doctor you call you say well i d like to see a male doctor you never say i would like to see a female doctor you say i d like to see a lady doctor
1	doctor
1	that should go it should be male or female
1	yeah
1	to be equal to the male
1	yes
1	erm because it s a stigma really erm the use of the word lady erm or woman a woman doctor my mother always tell me to use the trunc wor trunc if you say oh that woman over there has got a bright red jacket on my mother would say to me it s very rude to use the word woman you ve always got to say lady
1	yeah
1	well that s not that s not so anymore and it can t be so in trunc th trunc in these days of equality
1	no no
1	because you d say that man over there nobody would say well that s rude you can say gentleman
1	yeah
1	that man over there but trunc i trunc it s very strange erm and these things are being erm are being weeded out over the years aren t they
1	yeah i i ve got involved trunc wi trunc with a number of other activities as well and and one was working in the hospice movement
1	right
1	and i ve worked in the hospice movement for more than sixteen years now
1	really yeah
1	and i had to change as i used to be a minibus driver and then the nhs got rid of most of the minibuses
1	right
1	and i had to either withdraw from the hospice or find something else to do
1	right
1	and i i chose to go to college at the age of sixty six i think
1	did you
1	and i do er swedish body massage
1	oh really oh right my goodness
1	erm that is the most extremely rewarding thing i have ever done with in particular terminally ill patients
1	really yeah yeah
1	and i think it s it s not so much the massage but it s the warmth of somebody s touch
1	yes exactly
1	but initially it was a little bit of a problem because i m sure the hospice felt that oh we shouldn t have a man
1	yeah er
1	handling these ladies
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	but in the end it went complete reversal and the ladies
1	right
1	would ask for me
1	yeah yeah yeah
1	and it was a matter of building trust
1	yeah
1	and take someone into a therapy room
1	what a wonderful thing to do
1	it it is it is
1	what a trunc wo trunc you still do it do you
1	i still do it but because we ve moved into a different area
1	yeah
1	erm it s still in its infancy
1	right
1	with the health and wellbeing centre in anon type place
1	right gosh oh right
1	so i i m due to be there this afternoon
1	oh are you gosh
1	and er
1	you are you do get around don t you that s wonderful
1	vocal desc laugh there may or may not be people who would like to try
1	no no exactly
1	they can have simple things
1	yeah
1	in fact the club could even do it if they have a thing with ladies here
1	yeah
1	they could have hand massage unclear for nothing unclear
1	yes exactly that would be lovely
1	or to hands or feet or
1	well that s a wonderful idea now you see i wonder how many of those people out there know that about you and i know in fifteen minutes today
1	most of the men wouldn t know er
1	they wouldn t
1	because you have to obey erm all the er the rules about er privacy
1	yeah
1	you don t
1	yeah
1	talk about people
1	no no
1	i would talk about an individual but
1	yeah
1	no names or
1	no of course not
1	where or when
1	no of course not
1	erm and it would only be a hint of
1	yeah
1	the sort of things
1	yeah
1	that people have to face
1	yeah
1	unclear with unclear
1	i mean so many
1	yeah
1	you re you re right thing about not being touched so many people are trunc s trunc maybe live on their own or go into a hospice they they they re they re coming to the end of their life and you know they ve got no one no one ever touches them
1	that s right
1	they ve gone trunc c trunc they ve got completely no human contact
1	no and i felt that was important in the hospice environment because so often it s perhaps elderly ladies
1	mm mm
1	who have been living on their own as a widow for perhaps twenty
1	mm
1	thirty years
1	yeah yeah
1	and no one has touched them
1	no
1	but in that safe environment
1	yeah
1	in a ward
1	yeah
1	in the room er surrounded by nursing staff and other staff
1	yeah
1	i i have found it extremely rewarding the reactions
1	yes
1	it s just quite amazing
1	yes i m sure
1	er
1	yeah the other thing too which i mean it s it s very different but it s the same sort of thing people who take their friendly dogs into places
1	oh yes
1	and they re allowed to stroke them
1	that s right
1	and the touching of that is so beneficial
1	trunc def trunc it s such a highlight that is
1	it is yeah
1	yes yeah
1	and i mean there s something about a dog that always trunc wa trunc you know wants you to smile you want to smile don t you there s something about a dog or a pet
1	and they have got a level of understanding that far outreaches
1	oh yes
1	what we have they know
1	er
1	what s going on
1	yeah they do
1	yeah they do
1	they re amazing and and they re being used so much now to diagnose different cancers aren t they
1	yeah
1	and all sorts of diseases and it s
1	yeah
1	not just cancers it
1	mm
1	erm diabetes no erm er er er a helping dog now can be a diabetic dog who can erm a diabetic erm diagnosing dog should i say
1	yes
1	who can notice the acetone on the breath or the smell of the person that they re looking at
1	yeah their senses are just
1	the senses are
1	incredible
1	incredible aren t they
1	they really are
1	yeah
1	yes
1	now what have we done we ve done seventeen minutes are you happy with that
1	yes
1	trunc w trunc

0	oh that s good pause dur short unlike all other
0	i don t get the
0	i totally forgot that i was reading subtitles when i saw crouching tiger hidden dragon

0	oh that s really cool
0	yeah pause dur short that s interesting
0	so yeah
0	so they met in england then
0	no

0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh

0	no
0	um she said something about
0	mm
0	vocal desc laugh dan would be quite fun to have come on holiday
0	that s the one trunc i trunc near carlisle
0	oh that s a trunc differ trunc oh
0	in
0	in scotland is it
0	it s um pretty much directly west of inverness pause dur short but on the other side of scotland
0	mm pause dur short yeah pause dur short yeah pause dur short i think anon type place s just the name of the cottages er like the the er i don t think it s the village or anything so
0	not particularly pause dur short um
0	just the ones that i ve seen
0	i think well the ones in scotland where we ve been before which are really nice pause dur short it s just sort of um three linked together pause dur short but it s like it s not a big development or anything pause dur short it s just one big building that s divided into three
0	mm
0	sort of mid wales
0	mm
0	ah cliffs cliffs
0	mm
0	right
0	aw pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	i love tiny horses
0	aw pause dur short was it a baby or was it just a really really tiny horse
0	i think it must have been a young one
0	mm
0	bit harsh pause dur short vocal desc laugh mm
0	yeah
0	vocal desc laugh oh shrek s so good pause dur short i caught a bit of shrek over christmas pause dur short and i have seen it before years ago when it came out but it s quite good pause dur short nothing lives up to the first one though
0	just so good pause dur short oh pause dur short i ve got that film on video pause dur short i need to buy the the dvd slash download it slash get internet pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh yeah pause dur short ah i m all warm again now pause dur short vocal desc laugh what time is it
0	so it should be outdoors
0	cos it s horrible
0	oo pause dur short right pause dur short okay that s
0	ah pause dur short that s no good pause dur short actually yeah pause dur short bloomsbury offices were mentally hot pause dur short and it was like the hottest two weeks of the summer pause dur short and i was just like uh pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	oh that s alright then
0	vocal desc laugh
0	actually though we are moving across the road um like next month
0	attached to where i sit pause dur short vocal desc laugh but we ll see
0	i m fairly attached to where i sit pause dur short it s partly a fear of the unknown
0	vocal desc laugh
0	vocal desc laugh
0	a what shirt
0	yeah
0	murmurings pause dur short that er we might be our building might be getting a strip down and rebuilt
0	in like several years
0	or whatever
0	if er yeah
0	the idea would be to basically make it all new energy efficient et cetera et cetera
0	yeah
0	right
0	um
0	and you could get all of mott s staff into that one building rather than split across three buildings
0	um
0	oh right
0	vocal desc laugh
0	yeah
0	but yeah pause dur short so maybe in about a year s time they
0	mm
0	yeah
0	yeah
0	work from home
0	dunno pause dur short organizationally
0	yeah pause dur short it would be um it s er a lot easier not to work at home i think
0	you could have er sort of um like trunc t trunc er sort of some days a week you work from home some days you come into the office
0	which i think is maybe the easiest way pause dur short so you don t need to be like ber organized and have all your stuff pause dur short cos you can go in and you know occasionally and get stuff and just keep swapping round pause dur short but then you only need half the desks
0	and then it ll probably er take about a year for them to do it
0	if it s er you know all jazzy and shiny and new would
0	yeah
0	stop throwing money away
0	because this might be on the horizon that they re not prioritizing small trunc bi trunc smaller repairs
0	vocal desc laugh yeah
0	yeah
0	it got manky pause dur short because they were like well we re not gonna spend a penny on it pause dur short vocal desc laugh
0	but anon type address
