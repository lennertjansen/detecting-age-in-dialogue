S0642,S29X,5,yes this is a a recreational course at the Creative Innovation Centre so the creative the word creative innovation is key to the sort of course we do here it's not the normal erm sort of for instance watercolour for beginners type course so a lot of the erm the people who attend are the majority of them are mature people and quite a few have experienced a reasonably good or very er professional art education but it's open to erm anyone really and we have about twenty doing painting and drawing in the morning and about twenty doing the life drawing and the nearest you could say was related to would be a foundation type course,119,50_plus
S0486,S29X,6,right,1,50_plus
S0642,S29X,7,in an art school so it's quite diagnostic in a sense,12,50_plus
S0486,S29X,8,right okay,2,50_plus
S0642,S29X,9,but it's very erm liberally individually biased er in the sense that people are encouraged to sort of work in a way that suits them and I suppose my philosophy would be that they'll learn more from each other than they would from me,46,50_plus
S0486,S29X,10,right,1,50_plus
S0642,S29X,11,cos cos they work they're encouraged to experiment really,10,50_plus

S0486,S29X,14,no okay,2,50_plus

S0441,S2AJ,286,why does she want it all? I don't understand,11,19_29

S0441,S2AJ,288,I don't know why she wants it all but sure that's doesn't,15,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,289,"it's because he wanted to leave us five thousand pounds each which for me and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> obviously isn't as much as her because she's got three children",30,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,290,yeah,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,291,and also she's got all these great grandchildren so she feels like she has to like distribute the money further,21,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,292,yeah,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,293,but that's her choice you know like that's not grandad's choice grandad's doesn't want to support his great grandchildren he doesn't really care that much about them,33,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,294,no,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,295,sounds horrible but he doesn't care enough but she's like you know it's just not fair I think all the money should go to us and my mum's like but he doesn't want that and she basically just being really dicky about it,48,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,296,"moron <pause dur=""short"" />",1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,297,you know when you just look at your your own siblings and you just think I can't ever imagine being in a,23,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,298,I know,2,19_29

S0439,S2AJ,301,no,1,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,302,it's just so sad,5,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,303,"yeah I can't imagine ever arguing with <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> over money",11,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,304,no,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,305,because we both just be like if mum and dad die just split it,14,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,306,yeah,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,307,"there'd be no question on well you know <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> you didn't live in the country for how many years and so I've done more therefore I deserve more money like",33,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,308,it doesn't work like that,6,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,309,yeah it doesn't like that's not how it works you just everything you just half it it is like there's just no respect from the other person,30,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,310,"no <pause dur=""short"" /> what a dick?",5,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,311,yeah,1,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,312,I hate that it's really sad when it gets like that that's what happened when my grandma's mum died they got really funny about money,28,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,313,yeah,1,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,314,I mean to be fair my nanny did leave more money to others than she did to,17,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,315,but then I guess it's their decision or who to be executive,13,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,316,yeah exactly er,3,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,317,and there was this case in the news the other week that really annoyed me actually this woman went to court because her mum didn't leave her any money in her will because she ran off she got married and she ran off with somebody her mum didn't like so her mum basically cut her off and they never spoke they did not speak from the time the woman ran off with her husband until the time her mum died,82,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,318,yeah,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,319,so her mum was just like basically disowned her she's like you're not my daughter I don't really want anything to do with you I don't want to leave you my estate and it was like a lot of money and the daughter went to court to get it and you're just like mm I think that's really unfair,65,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,320,yes,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,321,because the daughter didn't deserve like she just didn't deserve the money you know it's the mum's money,22,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,322,yeah,1,19_29
S0439,S2AJ,323,she didn't like her mum she just wanted the money and you're just like,16,19_29
S0441,S2AJ,324,it is not good,4,19_29

S0336,S2C9,17,"yeah and not a single one like it's an hour on the train they've got no excuse <pause dur=""short"" /> like they they act like I live miles away and I don't",32,19_29
S0362,S2C9,18,an hour's really not that far is it?,10,19_29
S0336,S2C9,19,no and like I appreciate that everybody has their own thing going on but like to say that not a single one of them has given me a single weekend do you know what I mean? or even like popped up for the day like,46,19_29
S0362,S2C9,20,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,21,"pathetic <pause dur=""short"" /> so",2,19_29
S0362,S2C9,22,and they could do couldn't they?,8,19_29
S0336,S2C9,23,they could so easily like,5,19_29
S0362,S2C9,24,just have some lunch and go home,7,19_29
S0336,S2C9,25,exactly,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,26,it's really cheap as well on the train,9,19_29
S0336,S2C9,27,"that's what I've said to <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> I was like oh I will literally come and meet you for lunch like <pause dur=""short"" /> I'll get the train down <pause dur=""short"" /> we'll spend a couple of hours having lunch walking round shops maybe and then I'll get the train home like it doesn't have to be a a huge thing every time cos like that's the other thing now is like I on the on the days that I do go up it's like it has to be this whole day thing so you're going for breakfast when we first get there and then we're walking round all afternoon and then we're going for dinner and I'm getting like the last train home and I'm thinking like why? like <pause dur=""short"" /> why is it this whole day thing where all of us ending up having to spend a whole fortune?",157,19_29
S0362,S2C9,28,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,29,"cos that's the other thing you know like <pause dur=""short"" /> if they came here <pause dur=""short"" /> they'd have the expense of the train but I'd feed them and I'd put them up <pause dur=""short"" /> whereas <trunc>w</trunc> the other way round I have the expense of paying the train travel",46,19_29
S0362,S2C9,30,and then they'd say let's go out for dinner,11,19_29
S0336,S2C9,31,"yeah and then I have to pay for dinner and everything as well so when I went in April last year I spent seventy pounds in one day just to go and see them and I'm like that's so expensive like <pause dur=""short"" /> the least you could do is say oh <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> if you're coming here I'll host like afternoon tea or I'll make some lunch do you know what I mean? like there's just nothing like none of them do it",87,19_29
S0362,S2C9,32,"it's the <anon type=""place"" /> way isn't it?",9,19_29
S0336,S2C9,33,it's stupid it's so expensive and like,9,19_29
S0362,S2C9,34,I think it's the I think that's the mentality of the of people that live there isn't it?,22,19_29
S0336,S2C9,35,I know and I just think like <trunc>n</trunc> not one of them has ever offered to like buy me a drink or anything for like considering that I'd paid for like train travel and stuff like that,37,19_29
S0362,S2C9,36,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,37,so,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,38,"it's yeah <vocal desc=""laugh"" />",3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,39,but never mind,3,19_29
S0362,S2C9,40,"that's like erm it's like I was up here having conversations with erm <pause dur=""short"" /> what I can't remember the root of it but like er <pause dur=""short"" /> right let me get it in my head cos I need to remember <pause dur=""short"" /> it's something happened",44,19_29
S0336,S2C9,41,"<vocal desc=""laugh"" />",0,19_29
S0362,S2C9,42,"er cos er if I remember who it is erm it might have a relevance but it might be anyway talking about how people are paying for things and like erm one of the or some of the one of the lads now got married in in America <pause dur=""short"" /> and he was like yeah boys come <trunc>ov</trunc> come over come over like it'll be class er for my wedding",68,19_29
S0336,S2C9,43,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,44,"you're gonna be the ushers yeah like sweet ushers like rock over rocked over made them pay for the suit hire suit hire <vocal desc=""laugh"" /> <pause dur=""short"" /> and he made them pay for the hotel that they were staying in like the night before the night before the wedding",47,19_29
S0336,S2C9,45,even though they had flights to pay for as well,10,19_29
S0362,S2C9,46,"and for all the way to er New York for him and one of them's a lecturer so he had to like wing work off <pause dur=""short"" /> ridiculous innit? and so I was <trunc>thi</trunc> oh I know what it was <pause dur=""short"" /> it was <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> telling me about her and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s bridesmaid dresses",53,19_29
S0336,S2C9,47,oh right yeah,3,19_29
S0362,S2C9,48,"cos she <trunc>sai</trunc> <vocal desc=""laugh"" /> they told me that they <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> made made her pay for the dresses <vocal desc=""laugh"" />",15,19_29
S0336,S2C9,49,er I don't really <trunc>understa</trunc> like I thought that was a bit of the thing of the past like expecting the bride to pay like if I could afford to buy the bridesmaid dresses I would but I'd like to feel I'd like to think that whoever it was my bridesmaid would understand if I needed them to pay for it do you know what I mean? like I feel like that's a that's a conversation that you should be prepared to have as bridesmaid but they're being a bit awkward about the whole thing anyway it's just,105,19_29
S0362,S2C9,50,is the er is the thing coming up? er oh yeah no I did hear actually about it,19,19_29
S0336,S2C9,51,yeah hen do is,4,19_29
S0362,S2C9,52,the hen do,3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,53,in June erm it's all a bit annoying to be honest I,13,19_29
S0362,S2C9,54,"it was going to be it's <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> sounded said it was sounding like it was gonna be an absolute dead <vocal desc=""laugh"" /> dead er fish but that was clear but <trunc>th</trunc> when her sister that was like now we need to do more things",43,19_29
S0336,S2C9,55,"yeah like it's a bit awkward cos like what's happened is that <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> have decided and like to be fair it sounds like the kind of thing <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> would like is that erm they've hired this cottage for the weekend which could be really really sweet but there's only fifteen of us which I don't think is a huge amount of people anyway erm and it's quite a big cottage from what I can gather and so and because they've picked this like top-notch cottage with a hot tub and all this kind of stuff",104,19_29
S0362,S2C9,56,expensive,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,57,"it's quite expensive so people are paying like a hundred quid a hundred and something quid for three nights in this place right? and obviously people are also having to book time off work and they're having to book the Friday and the Monday off work erm <pause dur=""short"" /> but what they haven't contemplated is if you are asking people to go to just like a house for the weekend you've got to put some serious planning into like keeping those people entertained for the entire weekend and people were kind of <trunc>s</trunc> sort of saying like oh you know like I'm on a budget I can't do loads I can't spend loads of money so <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> have been trying to come up with different ideas to like do things on the cheap <pause dur=""short"" /> erm but one of their activities that they were suggesting for us to do during the day was to go quad biking which most of us like were like oh that sounds quite cool but it was fifty pound per person which is quite a lot of money erm so a lot of people were like no I'm not gonna do it so before you know it they were like oh we're gonna have to we'll have to get rid of the quad biking so then people are like oh so what are we gonna do instead? and people start suggesting things and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> are getting really tetchy then cos people are kind of like <pause dur=""short"" /> taking over or sort of saying you know like one person will say something and if a few people like it you've suddenly got a whole group of people that are going oh yeah we should definitely do this",304,19_29
S0362,S2C9,58,"like oh shit that's that's my idea <vocal desc=""laugh"" />",9,19_29
S0336,S2C9,59,"exactly so it's just a bit awkward so erm <pause dur=""short"" /> I don't know I think <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> have kind of taken the reins back a little bit now but I just don't know what <pause dur=""short"" /> it could be a really nice weekend <pause dur=""short"" /> but I think it's gonna be quite cliquey in that like people will stick to the people that they know",66,19_29
S0362,S2C9,60,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,61,"erm <pause dur=""short"" /> and I think it will I think it could be a bit boring at times so I think you will have people going off and like <pause dur=""short"" /> you know I can imagine <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s mum <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> maybe going off for a walk if they want to go and explore a little bit and they might have a couple of stragglers with them but then other people might wanna stay in and play games or do you know what I mean? I think it's gonna be a bit of a weird one but like",99,19_29
S0362,S2C9,62,that could be nice though,5,19_29
S0336,S2C9,63,I think so I mean what I don't really understand is like,13,19_29
S0362,S2C9,64,"or <trunc>sh</trunc> <trunc>sh</trunc> or they should allow what I would do in that situation like right you know <pause dur=""short"" /> there's er this <trunc>m</trunc> morning or till three o'clock",25,19_29
S0336,S2C9,65,do what you like,4,19_29
S0362,S2C9,66,you can do what you like,6,19_29
S0336,S2C9,67,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,68,you you can go away and <trunc>s</trunc> and explore,8,19_29
S0336,S2C9,69,and I think you need to do that for a whole weekend like you can't plan like forty-eight fifty-eight odd hours' worth of entertainment it's stupid you might as well say like oh so this morning like erm you can do whatever you like here's a couple of things you could do in the local area or you can just do whatever you want but like what they've done is they've picked the cottage because it's pretty and they've not really looked at the location so what they've done is booked the place and then looked at the location and thought oh,111,19_29
S0362,S2C9,70,shit there's nothing there,5,19_29
S0336,S2C9,71,"there's nothing here <pause dur=""short"" /> and it's you just wouldn't would you? like if you were gonna pick a nice cottage you'd probably make sure that A there's some either a nice walk or like there's some sort of activity that you could do <pause dur=""short"" /> but there's nothing",54,19_29
S0362,S2C9,72,but <trunc>li</trunc>,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,73,"apart from this quad biking yeah nothing <pause dur=""long"" /> and it's awkward as well cos like they've picked somewhere that's three hours away from here but kind of in the arse end of nowhere so everybody's got to drive <pause dur=""short"" /> and you've got fifteen people that don't all know each other like trying to coordinate lifts so like some are going down early some are some are going down late like <pause dur=""short"" /> and then because they're staying in a cottage they want to do a massive food shop and take food with us so they're charging everybody X amount for food but obviously they're gonna effectively dictate what people are eating for the weekend I'm just like oh <trunc>th</trunc> it's just awkward they've they've they've given themselves a really tough job",141,19_29
S0362,S2C9,74,"in that situation again what I would do is I'd take I'd <unclear /> going I'd make sure I've got erm <pause dur=""short"" /> a cooked breakfast for every day che-che-che easy",32,19_29
S0336,S2C9,75,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,76,"everyone can have what they want of that <pause dur=""short"" /> lunch I would just get loads of bread and",17,19_29
S0336,S2C9,77,sandwich fillings,2,19_29
S0362,S2C9,78,just sandwich filling,3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,79,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,80,and they can just make that and for and for tea you just do like buffet,16,19_29
S0336,S2C9,81,"yeah or you could even like cos there's fifteen of us you could just like divide people into groups and sort of say right on night one these people are cooking so <trunc>betwee</trunc> between now and then like think about what you wanna cook and then send us a list and we'll add it to the shop or whatever so then every night you've got different people cooking <pause dur=""short"" /> it's just hard <pause dur=""short"" /> yeah I'm leaving them to me and <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> are staying well and truly out of it like it got so cringe cos like",99,19_29
S0362,S2C9,82,"<vocal desc=""laugh"" /> oh no",2,19_29
S0336,S2C9,83,cos like,2,19_29
S0362,S2C9,84,I can imagine them hating life,6,19_29
S0336,S2C9,85,"yeah and like <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> was starting to like demand strippers and shit like that and you're just like oh that's so <trunc>ta</trunc>",23,19_29
S0362,S2C9,86,"<anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> was?",3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,87,"yeah and you just think like it's <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s hen do I can't see <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> finding a stripper funny and also <pause dur=""short"" /> strippers are awkward at the best of times but more awkward when you have to like get them to come to your house like it's not as if you're like out in a club and it's a bit funny like <pause dur=""short"" /> they come into a cottage of fifteen girls like that's not enough of crowd for it to be the",86,19_29

S0336,S2C9,741,I <trunc>don</trunc> yeah I think I'm I'm a little bit tainted cos I I love the girls like I know I know they're I know they can be really bitchy and I guess I'm it's easy for me because I've never really been a target of it I've,54,19_29
S0362,S2C9,742,no not at all,4,19_29
S0336,S2C9,743,never like I I've never,6,19_29
S0362,S2C9,744,"I remember the time I remember a time when erm when <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> said to me like yeah people will bitch like at everyone but nobody's ever bitched to me about <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />",32,19_29
S0336,S2C9,745,no and I,3,19_29
S0362,S2C9,746,and that just says it all,6,19_29
S0336,S2C9,747,I I'm never the target of anything,8,19_29
S0362,S2C9,748,no,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,749,like and like I know that sounds stupid because <trunc>t</trunc> talk behind people's backs but I honestly like I just don't know what they'd say about me like,30,19_29
S0362,S2C9,750,well er they clearly don't,6,19_29
S0336,S2C9,751,and erm I love having them around and I I like the fact that they're sounds really bad but they're there in the background so if I want them they're there,34,19_29
S0362,S2C9,752,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,753,but if I don't have time for them then I don't have time for them but so I couldn't imagine just like cutting myself off from them completely and I actually really enjoy spending time with them,40,19_29
S0362,S2C9,754,well that's good yeah,5,19_29
S0336,S2C9,755,"but I'm just a bit I feel sorry for <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> because like",13,19_29
S0362,S2C9,756,"she's their the <trunc>tar</trunc> or the target <vocal desc=""laugh"" />",7,19_29
S0336,S2C9,757,yeah and also like I think she's almost it sounds really stupid but like by sort of saying like oh I can't be bothered with it but then turning up every so often she makes it almost worse for herself because like,44,19_29
S0362,S2C9,758,"yeah <pause dur=""short"" /> I agree",3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,759,the time that she does turn up like she'll like she and maybe rightly so she kind of expects people to care that she's there but the people are just a bit like why should we care the one time you decide to turn up?,48,19_29
S0362,S2C9,760,yeah I can understand,4,19_29
S0336,S2C9,761,"like it's <trunc>awkwar</trunc> it's really awkward and I'm like stuck in the middle of it because they always ask me about <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> like even last night like she hadn't bothered telling anybody else that she wasn't coming so like <pause dur=""short"" /> I basically said on the girl's group like oh erm dinner at <anon type=""place"" /> for my birthday let me know if you can make it and everybody else said yes and like <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> just like rather than cos she doesn't wanna look bad she won't say like oh I can't make it so she just won't say anything but then it's even more noticeable so like erm today <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> was just like <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> question mark like asking like cos she said like oh <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> what are you doing for your birthday? and then nobody replied and then she put <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> question mark like to say like oh she's away <pause dur=""short"" /> and apparently <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> had to like <pause dur=""short"" /> like text her to say like are you coming tonight? do I need to play like lay an extra place? because she just doesn't say anything <pause dur=""short"" /> and then it just makes yourself it I dunno that's what makes her a target do you know what I mean? it's really bad",224,19_29
S0362,S2C9,762,"yeah but like <pause dur=""short"" /> cos she's not been able to go to a few things she's probably thinking oh no I",22,19_29
S0336,S2C9,763,it looks bad,3,19_29
S0362,S2C9,764,"<anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> knows I'm not going like",7,19_29
S0336,S2C9,765,"yeah <pause dur=""short"" /> I think that's what she said to <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> as well",12,19_29
S0362,S2C9,766,cos she she would cos she would just go yeah yeah I can't go and everyone will go oh shock,21,19_29

S0362,S2C9,768,"like oh my god you can't even go to <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> <pause dur=""short"" /> actually I'm skint <vocal desc=""laugh"" />",15,19_29
S0336,S2C9,769,"yeah <pause dur=""short"" /> so I think she text <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> back and was just like <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> knows I've already taken her out for dinner like no I'm not coming like to kind of I think she was trying to stick up for herself a little bit which I don't really I don't blame her at all",57,19_29
S0362,S2C9,770,yeah <trunc>sh</trunc> it's <trunc>almo</trunc> it is tough,6,19_29
S0336,S2C9,771,it's awkward,3,19_29
S0362,S2C9,772,"it's it's not very nice but <pause dur=""short"" /> it's it well if you if that's what she wants then <pause dur=""short"" /> you know <trunc>fi</trunc> <trunc>fi</trunc>",23,19_29
S0336,S2C9,773,I'm happy for her I just hope I hope,10,19_29

S0336,S2C9,775,"yeah and I still don't trust him like I know he's a nice guy but I have serious reservations like <pause dur=""short"" /> not even about him as a person I just don't <pause dur=""short"" /> I don't trust <pause dur=""short"" /> I don't trust his loyalty",43,19_29
S0362,S2C9,776,mm maybe so,3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,777,"and he's got too many people too close to him that would lie for him <pause dur=""short"" /> like <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> was talking about the other day and I don't know whether it's just me being really untrustworthy but obviously he goes away on business a lot <pause dur=""short"" /> so it's him and <anon nameType=""m"" type=""name"" /> staying in nice hotels in like the middle of <anon type=""place"" /> <pause dur=""short"" /> I dunno I just don't buy it and like <pause dur=""short"" /> she like you know when the whole you know everything kicked off with <pause dur=""short"" /> you know like we had a weird patch at the beginning of last year because I told her that he'd <pause dur=""short"" /> he'd seen <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> when she was away?",117,19_29

S0336,S2C9,943,"that'd be <unclear>cruel</unclear> I mean like she'd be a nightmare every time you had a bill like <pause dur=""short"" /> like I can just see her <pause dur=""short"" /> being so picky and stuff and like <pause dur=""short"" /> trying to get out of any extra cost <pause dur=""short"" /> it's an awkward one though cos <pause dur=""short"" /> <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s doing <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> a favour in that obviously whatever she pays is helping <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> pay off her mortgage",65,19_29
S0362,S2C9,944,yeah,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,945,"so I think the I think they both pay like three hundred pound a month or something and that's their that's their mortgage and their bills so it's cheap for <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> even cheaper for <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> cos she's laughing like <pause dur=""short"" /> she's got somebody else paying off her mortgage for her <pause dur=""short"" /> but",55,19_29
S0362,S2C9,946,"yeah how would do you like <unclear /> you do know that if you move in with me like <pause dur=""short"" /> I will be sort of like using your money to",28,19_29
S0336,S2C9,947,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,948,pay off my mortgage you can do it the option's there but I don't ever want to think like oh my god I you've got so much money and I haven't,35,19_29
S0336,S2C9,949,"yeah <pause dur=""short"" /> it's awkward and I don't know you know like if it got to a point where <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> thought oh all of a sudden like actually I want my space like this is my house like can you get out like it's awkward <pause dur=""long"" />",46,19_29
S0362,S2C9,950,how much is her mortgage then?,7,19_29
S0336,S2C9,951,"not a lot I don't think erm <pause dur=""long"" /> I know her her mum had like from what I can gather her mum had savings that she was gonna put in a savings account but that she knew wasn't gonna make a lot of money",47,19_29
S0362,S2C9,952,right,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,953,"so instead she's put it into <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s house but not into <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s house in a like oh I've given you like forty grand for your house",30,19_29
S0362,S2C9,954,mm,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,955,"in a in a way of like when you move out you can give me that money back with whatever interest it's earned <pause dur=""short"" /> so but because of that obviously <pause dur=""short"" /> this meant that <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" />'s mortgage is a lot <pause dur=""short"" /> smaller",40,19_29
S0362,S2C9,956,mm,1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,957,so I think her mortgage is something like four hundred and fifty pound a month it's not a lot,20,19_29
S0362,S2C9,958,so basically she's getting everything for free,8,19_29
S0336,S2C9,959,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,960,and she won't be paying paid badly,8,19_29

S0362,S2C9,1722,"that's outrageous <vocal desc=""laugh"" /> but obviously with direct debit <pause dur=""short"" /> you obviously do pay a little bit more",16,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1723,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1724,but twelve pound a month,5,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1725,it's a lot more affordable,6,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1726,"twelve pound a month is erm <pause dur=""short"" /> I <trunc>t</trunc> that's alright",10,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1727,"yeah <pause dur=""short"" /> that would be about right <pause dur=""short"" /> that would be a hundred and forty-four yeah?",15,19_29

S0336,S2C9,1729,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1730,a long day,3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1731,mm,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1732,yeah so obviously that's it's so much better doing it that way than getting chunked out cos you don't you don't see it you just do it,31,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1733,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1734,it goes out and it goes,6,19_29

S0362,S2C9,1736,"<anon type=""place"" />",1,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1737,really? does she like it?,7,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1738,mm loves it,3,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1739,cos I know like quite a lot of people are raving cos they've got good classes and stuff on and everything now as well isn't there?,29,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1740,yeah she's gone to so many classes and I I'm I'm really <trunc>en</trunc> like appreciative of the way they they've run it and the way they've got it all set up it's <trunc>ver</trunc> they've clearly done their research,43,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1741,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1742,"<trunc>w</trunc> cos I know I know he has because I know er <anon nameType=""m"" type=""name"" />'s dad is a big businessman",18,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1743,yeah,1,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1744,"but I'd say <anon nameType=""f"" type=""name"" /> pays what does she pay? <vocal desc=""misc"" /> like thirty <pause dur=""short"" /> thirty quid a month?",18,19_29
S0336,S2C9,1745,it's not a lot,5,19_29
S0362,S2C9,1746,"maybe? er I'm <trunc>th</trunc> that sounds about right <pause dur=""short"" /> and so basically you you can either buy a erm a gym membership or a classes membership so you what it's the <trunc>sa</trunc> same price right is this got really weird acoustics? like <vocal desc=""misc"" /> I can hear myself like ringing in the background",52,19_29

S0680,S2CY,131,yes,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,132,and everything's got a computer in it these days hasn't it?,14,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,133,yes,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,134,whether they actually fix these things or even in the garage they clip the computer on now don't they?,21,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,135,"yes but I mean it depended it's like at <anon type=""place"" /> they have their erm <unclear>throw them</unclear> about boys they have their <unclear>thrown</unclear> about boys and they have their sort of erm ones who can stick wires in holes and screw something up",40,50_plus

S0679,S2CY,138,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,139,and have to explain it to the managing director,9,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,140,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,141,but you know it depends what level you're working at,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,142,yeah,1,50_plus

S0679,S2CY,144,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,145,and teach himself things,4,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,146,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,147,like he was teaching himself that erm whatever it was was it TCP IP?,15,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,148,oh yes yes,3,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,149,or something he he was teaching himself that cos he kind of knew it but he was trying to do it all the bits he used to skip over he was trying to fill in the,36,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,150,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,151,the gaps of it yes,5,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,152,I it it always tickles me TCP er because of TCP,11,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,153,I know,2,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,154,it is TCP isn't it?,7,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,155,TCP IP,2,50_plus

S0680,S2CY,163,antiseptic yes,2,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,164,I don't think don't know if it's approved to do that these days,16,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,165,I think they <trunc>st</trunc>,3,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,166,but did we have?,5,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,167,I think they still sell it or they used to sell it until very recently,15,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,168,it's probably got really harmful chemicals in it <unclear />,10,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,169,it's probably got bought out by somebody,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,170,oh gargle <unclear>it sometimes has its use</unclear> for gargling,4,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,171,it was for gargling and you could put it on cuts but it was,14,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,172,oh,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,173,a bit oh,3,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,174,yes oh it was the only thing I ever had on cuts we didn't have Savlon or,18,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,175,you could put it on spotty things,7,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,176,Acriflex yes it went on everything,6,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,177,yes oh we I I erm we had Savlon sometimes,10,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,178,mm I don't remember Savlon I just remember TCP,10,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,179,yes it was in a no it it was it <trunc>w</trunc>it was in one of those you had erm one of those metal sort of tubes that have,28,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,180,yes,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,181,like a hexagonal,3,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,182,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,183,you know before they were,5,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,184,yeah,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,185,just you used to get ointments <unclear />,7,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,186,same sort of thing you'd get oil paint in,10,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,187,yes that kind of tube,5,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,188,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,189,yes well it wasn't lead like an oil paint tin,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,190,no no,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,191,but it was metally,4,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,192,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,193,<unclear /> yes,2,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,194,so it's getting on for bedtime,7,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,195,think so I'm going to go and knit,9,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,196,"erm what do you think we should do tomorrow? er can we do anything useful in <anon nameType=""m"" type=""name"" />'s kitchen? can we clear I think you were quite interested in investigating was it on top of the table?",40,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,197,erm well if I move those boxes erm that box on the on the table is I believe is quite heavy,21,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,198,okay what do you think's in it?,9,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,199,but,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,200,is it glasses?,4,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,201,erm possibly I it'll say on it,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,202,oh right,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,203,"there is a box that is quite heavy there's two boxes on that table I think or did I move one? anyway erm <pause dur=""short"" /> I can probably well I have picked it up before but it might might need a bit of <trunc>s</trunc> you know steering me onto something",49,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,204,yeah,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,205,can put it maybe on a chair,7,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,206,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,207,or something,2,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,208,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,209,cos I don't wanna put it down on the floor cos it's too heavy to pick up er,21,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,210,would that small table help?,6,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,211,I don't know whether it'll be too heavy on this table,13,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,212,well we don't want to break it it's a very important table do you have two of them?,21,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,213,"no I only bought <trunc>o</trunc> I only had well they only had one that was <vocal desc=""sigh"" /> they only had one and I bought it sort of cos I thought about buying two at the time but there was cos cos they're only plain wood",43,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,214,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,215,and er there was one that had got a few more knotholes,12,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,216,mm mm,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,217,and that was the best one so I bought it but they didn't have any more,17,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,218,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,219,you know those ones they have that they call television tables or whatever? they <trunc>the</trunc>they were ones that <trunc>w</trunc> had that you still get them they're quite tall,29,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,220,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,221,and they have a a top like that they <trunc>ha</trunc>they had <trunc>l</trunc> hundreds of those but they only had,18,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,222,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,223,a few of these and they didn't get any more in,12,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,224,mm I thought about getting a couple of tables like this for,12,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,225,yes,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,226,"<anon type=""place"" />",1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,227,yes,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,228,and they had some on Freecycle I think they were made of something that sounded quite I think it was bamboo,21,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,229,yeah,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,230,which I think er was it bamboo? no rubberwood,10,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,231,rubberwood yes,2,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,232,which I quite like actually,5,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,233,yes but it you have to check how they're fixed cos this one's quite good because,18,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,234,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,235,it's got that little thing you twist,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,236,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,237,but my that little brown one that's really an outside one you know the little one? there's a <trunc>l</trunc> I've got a little one like that that's slatted,32,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,238,oh right,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,239,brown criss-cross legs,3,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,240,yes yes,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,241,that's leaning on <unclear /> that heap of junk,9,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,242,yes,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,243,now that one you open it up and it clips into and it goes into a hook,17,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,244,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,245,well if you pick it up,6,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,246,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,247,unless you put your hand under and hold that it collapses,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,248,I'm very nervous about moving this one actually,9,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,249,well this one's alright cos it's got a peg,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,250,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,251,it's got a peg in it as long as the peg's in it <unclear>well</unclear> it stands up without the peg in it,23,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,252,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,253,but it has a little peg <unclear />,7,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,254,I didn't go for these rubberwood ones because I just really wasn't <unclear>up to it</unclear>,14,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,255,yeah it depends how high they are but that little one that's why,14,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,256,they look quite nice,4,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,257,that little one's quite a nice just small size,10,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,258,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,259,that's why I have it in the house,9,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,260,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,261,but er that's why I tie string round the tops,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,262,mm mm,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,263,because,1,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,264,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,265,you know you don't want it collapsing,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,266,you don't want it collapsing absolutely,7,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,267,and my little table that's at the side of the settee with the drop leaves,16,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,268,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,269,the small ones it's all very well cos you pull out these things that hold the flaps up,19,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,270,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,271,but if you put something heavy on one side it tips up,12,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,272,yes,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,273,it's alright if you put it on the sides where the solid bit is,15,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,274,mm yeah,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,275,but if you put it on the other side it tips up because it it <trunc>ch</trunc> hasn't got another gate leg,21,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,276,mm mm,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,277,which I didn't appreciate at the time,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,278,<unclear>it's hard to though</unclear> I mean one assumes that <unclear>these</unclear> are made gonna be made in a sensible way,15,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,279,well it's made it's nicely made,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,280,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,281,it's got <trunc>ni</trunc> it's nicely made,7,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,282,I think there were quite a few of those tables with a similar sort of problem,16,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,283,but if you buy one with the <trunc>e</trunc> you know so you can get little ones with gate legs,18,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,284,mm,1,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,285,but they're obviously more expensive because what I used to do with that one was put one leaf up you know and have a half circle table,28,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,286,mm mm,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,287,next to me but you can't put things on one side,12,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,288,"mm <pause dur=""short"" /> mm erm considering it's getting a bit late",10,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,289,yes I'm gonna have to go,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,290,oh okay,2,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,291,and knit somewhere <unclear />,4,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,292,righty-ho I think we how would you feel about leaving the Archers until tomorrow?,15,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,293,oh we can do the Archers tomorrow <unclear />,8,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,294,is that alright? okay,5,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,295,I'd forgotten it was an Archers day to be honest,11,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,296,oh yes it's not Saturday yet,7,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,297,I thought was thinking it cos we've had music on <unclear />,12,50_plus
S0679,S2CY,298,yes that's true okay,5,50_plus
S0680,S2CY,299,<unclear />,1,50_plus
